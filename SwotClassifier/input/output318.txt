We ordered two Grilled Open Chicken Sandwiches and one Cheese burger. After 15 mins they served us our orders but they skipped one sandwich. After complaining to them. They said that it will take 10 mins for them to make a another one. After which I cancelled the order. The new Manager there, then quickly brought me the sandwich and was quiet apologetic. Also he gave us complimentary dessert which I ddnt ask for. But that nice of them. Overall good food and good service. I guess the waiter who took my order was feeling too much of his rooza.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-06T16:16:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-06T17:00:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"517221007","name":"Sana Rashid"},{"id":"219000363","name":"Deen Sheikh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjE5MDAwMzYz","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"599353700115784","from":{"name":"Naveed Ahmed","id":"100001668018216"},"message":"Lolzz.... complimentary drink paid off","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-06T16:19:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"599354606782360","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"Try their philly cheese steak sandwich chikna hai","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-06T16:22:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"599354690115685","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"Calorie count?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-06T16:22:31+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"599354826782338","from":{"name":"Naj Saqib","id":"578411350"},"message":"anywhere between 600-800","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-06T16:23:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"599354883448999","from":{"name":"Naj Saqib","id":"578411350"},"message":"u should try some time Deen Sheikh","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-06T16:23:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"219000363","name":"Deen Sheikh","type":"user","offset":23,"length":11}]},{"id":"599357126782108","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"Cheese burger or chicken sandwich, I liks their big bad wolf burger....its good stuff....aaaaaowwwwwww","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-06T16:32:16+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"599359196781901","from":{"name":"Naj Saqib","id":"578411350"},"message":"Chicken burger dude.
