Any desert makers out there that wish to supply please get in touch with me on 03002020555 to discuss and arrange a meeting to go through what you have on offer.  All the deserts will not necessarily come from one source.  For example on the desi side we are going to put CAFEELA\u0027S SHAHI TUKRA which is one of the best Shahi Tukra\u0027s I have had for a long long time...we intend to credit the desert supplier with the credit on the menu...so for example if we have Cafeela\u0027s Shahi Tukra ...then that is what it will be called on the menu.   We will not take credit for it....Why we wont make our own deserts? ..that is a question that has a simple answer...we will be a restaurant famous for its food and service....deserts are not our forte ...so we will let the professionals in that field provide our customers with the best that is available in town.  In time when we are ready to launch our own array of deserts and are convinced it is top class...we will do so...It is a principle we will adhere to stongly...let us provide the best deserts in town under one roof.  I believe we will be one of a few Restaurants that will have a desert trolly rolled out to the table for the customers to choose from.... Seafood and other main menu dishes of course will be our own and made to as perfect as we can get it in an open kitchen atmosphere....so anyone wishing to supply on a fresh daily basis ..please get in touch.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-06T18:10:23+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-15T04:31:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"685660006","name":"Muhammed Ali Rahim Najjad"},{"id":"654298693","name":"Huma Akhter Mundia"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"509700022","name":"Hiba Akmal"},{"id":"619452805","name":"Sabrina Saboor Jawad"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"617715399","name":"Uzma Javeri"},{"id":"777488661","name":"Zarnak Sidhwa"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzA4MDI1NDkx","before":"Njg1NjYwMDA2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"456984151019407","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Descriptive enough...good luck :-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-06T18:11:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"456986354352520","from":{"name":"Haroon Leghari","id":"100000059823691"},"message":"Doc would love u to participate in our decision making process on deserts...u have agreat sweet tooth with a good sense of what is the best out there...u could have a panel of friends to help in the process....suggestions are welcome","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-06T18:18:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"456991007685388","from":{"name":"Akbar Khan","id":"100000245074195"},"message":"Cafela shahi tukras are out of this world.. it brings back the old world charm too..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-06T18:32:59+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"457012267683262","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Haroon Leghari I have had the pleasure if sampling several dessert experts in town and many are home bakers, who would love the opportunity to be able to reach a market who have sampled their products and then place orders.

I hardly get the opportunity to complain about the food.  Maybe once or twice but that was a long time ago.  Today however was another matter.  We were the only one\u0027s when we arrived so looked forward to total attention.  We visited for lunch at 1 p.m. and though the service was as excellent apart from the waiter not showing us the Special\u0027s board and expected us to walk around the corner to check it out.  We insisted he take the board off the hooks and bring it around to show it to us.  Not good!.  The food today left a lot to be desired. The bread basket had one type of bread a bit too dry and the other a bit too oily for my pallate.  The Herb butter was too soft and not being given a butter knife was I thought not really up to the mark.  The small vegi tit bits that are rolled out prior to the meal were just that much dryer then they should have been.   My host and myself were not very interested in a starter but decided to share the Scallops with Truffle Oil.  When it arrived it looked awful lying in the plate with such thin slices which probably amounted to one large scallop full stop.  They had a light drizzle of black pepper and did not look very appettizing!.  Then came the belch from me followed by one from my host.  It tasted vile!...we called the manager on duty and asked him to try one too..he took away the plate tried it and then returned initially to say that it tasted fine to him.  When I insisted he rethink his response as it tasted very bad he said it was probably the Truffle Oil being of very strong and pungent texture.  He brought the bottle over and let us smell it.  Yes, it was the Truffle Oil!...it was so strong it blew my nose away and my host\u0027s.  We all decided that the only way to add Truffle Oil to the Scallops would be to use just a drop rather then baste it with it.  The two don\u0027t work together for me as it stands!.  I had ordered the Red Crab with Garlic and Virgin Olive Oil.  A great dish and looked amazing!...the Red crab just looks so delicious even before you tuck in to it.  The taste was as expected wonderful but ever so slightly over cooked and wee bit dry in some parts.  The garnish was on the stingy side but was adequate because the Crab took center stage.  I noticed as the bread basket neared its end and only the dry bread was left there was no attempt to replenish it or even an offer to the effect.  The waiters were attentive and kept removing the left over crab shells and my host\u0027s prawn shells.  By the way my friend had the Spaghetti with Seafood.  He thought the spaghetti seemed a bit more soggy then normal having tried the same dish at one or two earlier occasions!.  The Prawns he said were extremely good.  Some background in the Restaurant might have also helped in the overall ambience!.  The shell crusher didn\u0027t get much of a chance to do much but the Crab drawer was a good touch and it helped a great deal in getting in to the nook and crany\u0027s of the crab shells.   Then came the dessert.  I ordered the Rasberry and my host the Lemon Sorbet.. both were excellent but little in quantity I thought....on hind sight it was good that it was not too much as it was lunch and ended a mixed bag of experiences at OKRA this lunch time.  I was looking out for Ayaz who I was sure was there when we arrived...I saw his Green BMW outside but when I asked later he had left.
