Anyhow so here goes , so tonight after finishing my meal at FatBurger I somehow forgot my wallet on the table I ate at \"Yes yes surprise surprise\" I do get my wallet back in the end , but thats not the point I realized I had forgotten my wallet at the table a good 30-45 mins after having left the restaurant. When I got back to the restaurant a good 45 mins later lawl , \"Vicky\" the guy who served me came straight up to me and said \"You forgot your wallet right \" I was taken aback I mean where in Karachi does that happen . I am sorry but living in Karachi I sort\u0027ve expected the story to go this way \"Yaar have you seen a black coloured leather wallet... I left it at that table there\" ANSWER - \"No sir... What wallet ? .... There never was a wallet ..... It never existed\". He said he had given the wallet to the general manager , so the general manager came upto to me he actually had my receipt number \"41\" attached to my wallet (I am impressed by their level of customer attention... It was peak rush hour the line was going all the way to the escalator ) . The manager asked my name tallied it with my ID card lawl he asked me to count my money and when I was completely satisfied he let me go .

Two queues with around 20 people in each queue.  Once the order is placed, it still takes anywhere between 15-25 minutes to serve.  Where they go wrong, excess staff in the cooking area and a mismatch in the cooking time versus the final preparation time.  Total damage - 6K for 6 persons.  Fatburger (beef) in 3 sizes, single, double and triple patty - pretty decent.  Jalapeño Chicken Burger - average plus and better than Hardee\u0027s.  They also have a turkey and a veggie option plus 3 options in chicken sandwich viz fried, crispy and grilled.  Also an option to have a double meat helping in chicken at extra cost. Complimentary BBQ sauce and extra jalapeños added to the burger.  Heinz Ketchup and 3 types of Tabasco.  Fat Fries - good and Onion Rings - initially served cold but then replaced.  Option to replace the fries with onion rings in the meal deals.  All meal deals Rs. 200 over and above the sandwich/burger prices.  Free refill of soft drinks/mango drink/ice tea.  Option to replace the soft drink with a milkshake by adding Rs. 190.
