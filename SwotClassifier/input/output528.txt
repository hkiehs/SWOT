So yeah. It will be a long one.\n\nOkra has always been a beautiful experience. And when one has the company of four wonderful friends (Missed one), dinner becomes an even better treat. I got there late, as usual, (I sahwy) but was just in time for the bread basket. Saira mixed together chili oil, olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and the resulting concoction with the multigrain bread and baguette was beautiful! The Mezze Platter I think I\u0027ve had for the third time, and it has been the same deliciousness every single time. I don\u0027t think anyone can make the hummus like Okra makes hummus. There was also a roasted cheese type thing that was salty, tangy and spread on the baguette was a party-in-my-mouth.  Amidst a thoroughly enjoyable conversation came our main courses. Now, I don\u0027t know the exact names, but Saira ordered a gourmet burger, which I didn\u0027t try but the fries were definitely NOT the pre-packaged frozen ones, yet were crispy and salted well, served with a side of mustard and ketchup. Sabeen and I ordered steaks, and while I don\u0027t know the name of Sabeen\u0027s steak, I do know that she had a circle of scallops surrounding her steak, which were, to me at least, a mix between mussels and fish, quite an interesting texture, and something I would really like to try again! My steak was done medium well, pink in the middle, just the way I like it, and was served with a blue cheese sauce that actually tasted of like Gruyere, and went very well with the steak and side of vegetables, which honestly I could have had all on their own with the blue cheese sauce. I also ordered a drink which I didn\u0027t quite catch the name of, but it was the best shikanjabeen-tasting drink I\u0027ve had in a while. The slightest hint of ginger was definitely refreshing and zesty. Qamarunnisa ordered a risotto, I believe, and Gulnaz ordered a shrimpy-pasta thingie, which she loved. For dessert, we had Sabeens absolutely-fantastically-yummy-in-my-mouth macaroons, which she wasn\u0027t happy with, and I can\u0027t wait to try out what her perfect ones taste like! The vanilla ice cream with sea salt and olive oil was interesting, and a must try for the adventurous ones. Flecks of vanilla in the ice cream itself, with the salt and hint of olive oil flavor was a combination I didn\u0027t believe I would particularly enjoy, but the flavors strangely enough, went together quite well. Then of course, I had to try out Okra\u0027s macaroons, and those are something I can definitely go for again, specially with a cup of coffee and a good book to keep me company.  We also got to meet Mariam Bilgrami , who was there for dinner with her family, and Ayaz Khan, who had been busy in the kitchen, but whom we had to meet and thank personally for such wonderful food. Our server Zahoor also deserves a special mention. Friendly, knowledgeable and attentive without being intrusive. May everyone have as fun a dinner as I have had tonight *Happy dance*","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-01T21:17:32+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-02T08:28:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"786945014","name":"Samia Chundrigar"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"},{"id":"1658841118","name":"Tara Kashif"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"100001278410513","name":"Maryam Yasser"},{"id":"705809316","name":"Sana Shahbaz"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzA1ODA5MzE2","before":"Nzg2OTQ1MDE0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"551519441565877","from":{"name":"Hassan Bhatti","id":"864185159"},"message":"ok read first line and read last line okra for good food it is.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-01T21:20:09+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"551523708232117","from":{"name":"Daniyal Qazi","id":"509315108"},"message":"Hahahah so basically you dont know the names of anything that you ordered?:p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-01T21:35:22+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"551643681553453","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Eeerrrmmm...maybe :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-02T01:19:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"551788744872280","from":{"name":"Tasneem Murtazaalibhai","id":"676000707"},"message":"Long","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-02T04:20:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"551791504872004","from":{"name":"Imran Muhammad","id":"775425216"},"message":"I went there on Tuesday night.
