I was really delighted to have such a great food. Appetizers were among the best in town. We ordered for appetizers, 44 trio, prawn gambas, smoked tomato soup, carpaccio, seafood gratin, and caesar\u0027s salad, much to my utter surprise, it was amazingly prepared and presented to perfection. I cant really comment on each individual appetizer, but in simple words.. they seem to be michelin star quality. For main course, ordered a variety of dishes, the best one among all was Chocolate reduction Steak, chardonnay steak, and sea bass. Service was to its best. I do not have a sweet tooth so didnt taste any of the deserts, but i am sure those were equally good. My first experience a few month back was really bad. But if they keep this much improved service and food quality, i would love to eat there every week. Sonia Chundrigar , i must appreciate the improvement and hats off to you guyz.

Same is the case with restaurants, with all due to respect to some who I am familiar with as restaurants owners, I recall a few years ago a famous restaurant of Lahore fame who had a one hour wait for their brunch and Hi-Tea, while people waited patiently I quietly went in to investigate the real story, lo and behold 50% of the place was empty, when I inquired, they said sir it is reserved, I inquired, how long do you hold the reservation? By that time they got nervous as I persisted on further info, and quietly gave me a table while others not so nice people waited patiently for their turn. It was all a hype made up to create an image in peoples mind that the place really runs, which was not the case. I don\u0027t know why people prefer to go to crowded places and thinks that is a barometer for quality and consistency. I would rather go to a empty place and get excellent service and good quality food like yours and your personal attention that go to a place where I will be part of the motley crowd and get 2nd class service.Questions like how many floors and branches are irrelevant, consistency of food and quality of service contacts is what coubts big time, but it seems our restaurant crowd has a different criteria when selecting a place, parameters like how many cars are outside the restaurant and what class of people are seen their is what matters. Its like a place in our neigbourhood which is always flowing with the tide, well that\u0027s another story, to be kept for another occasion.
