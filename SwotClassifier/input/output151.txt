Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Burger King gets a B+ today. For sure, teething problems on the operations side and a limited menu. However, the Whopper with Cheese was 80% like the burgers that I have eaten at BK in other countries. The main difference being that this was more well done and a touch drier than the prior experiences. That may be a personal thing since I also eat my steak medium rare! The basic taste of the burger was the flame grilled rather than fried that I prefer but it did seem a tad hastily prepared. My sense is that within a short period of time, the minor issues that exist will be ironed out and BK will be the same in Karachi as it is for an occasional fast food indulgence abroad.\n\nPreviously, my biggest complaint, and main reason why BK was not usually in my fast food options, were the fries. The new BK fries are 300% better than before and were a pleasant surprise! No, not quite as good as McDonalds or OPTP but pretty darned good ... and I even think they will be better in a few days!! I didn\u0027t try the Pepsi but was told by a member of my dining group that it was quite good.\n\nAgain, please keep in mind that my positive comments do not seek to compare a fast food burger to the exceptional offerings that can be had at restaurants such as Forty4. For a fast food burger, I personally prefer the Whopper to the Big Mac... and might think about trying the Angus version too. So, all in all, happy to have BK here in Karachi as another dining option.\n\nFinally, the Dolmen Mall food scene has truly become something special with tons and tons of reputable options for quick food as well as restaurants. Others may differ in their opinion, and I respect that, however I am quite pleased!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-07T14:04:53+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-08T05:20:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"633230637","name":"Mahnaz Hadi"},{"id":"850785116","name":"Iruj Khawaja"},{"id":"527720164","name":"Sara Khan"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"100004201268402","name":"Shakil Ahmed"},{"id":"524548090","name":"Saba Shaikh"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"514079467","name":"Noor Rehman"},{"id":"794615955","name":"Adnan Qureshi"},{"id":"739067064","name":"Rakhshanda Khan"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"530485619","name":"Hana Faisal"},{"id":"514492150","name":"Syed Adeel Rizvi"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"864470709","name":"Syed Muhammad Taha Askari"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"100000223684855","name":"Sana A.

Unstable huge rocks with no lighting around what so ever. 2. Clueless , uninformed restaraunt staff . No idea what their job entails , service probably the worst I\u0027ve ever received in any restaraunt in khi so far. Mismanagement isn\u0027t even the correct for them . My friend and I requested a table outdoors , which by the way was booming with people . We were told no table was free although there was a clearly an empty table . Apparently it was reserved \u0026 the customers were inside finishing a drink so we had to wait , after approx 15min , supposed drinking clients weren\u0027t exiting the indoors so we made our way to the free table . It was taken later the \"RESERVED\" line was a lie. From here it just went down hill , from the pepperoni pizza , piña colada , flat diet Pepsi \u0026 the most ridiculously presented slice of cheese cake ( that came with what looked like Mitchell\u0027s strawberry jam just blobbed on top) . Not of one these dishes/drinks were edible or drinkable. Complain? We did. A difference did it make? Not a slight. We were charged for each and every one of them . Having said all this : I must add one good point, the shisha \u0026 it\u0027s makers and servers( totally separate) knowledgable , friendly , we\u0027re coming every few mins to check if my shisha was ok.
