grams) unsalted butter, softened\n6 1/4 (175 grams) dark muscovado sugar\n6 1/4 fluid ounces (175 ml) honey\n4 1/2 fluid ounces (125 ml) coffee liqueur\n2 oranges, zested and juiced\n1 teaspoon mixed spice\n2 tablespoons good quality cocoa\n3 free-range eggs, beaten\n5 1/4 ounces (150 grams) plain flour\n2 1/2 ounces (75 grams) ground almonds\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\nFor decoration:\n1-ounce (25 grams) dark chocolate-covered coffee beans\nEdible glitter\nGold mini balls\nAbout 10 edible gold stars\nDirections\nPreheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\n\nLine the sides and bottom of an 8 by 3 1/2-inch deep, round loose-bottomed cake tin with a layer of reusable silicon baking parchment. When lining the tin with the parchment, cut the material into strips that are twice as high as the tin itself (it is easier to use two shorter strips of parchment, than one long strip); the height of the strips protects the cake from catching on the outside of the cake tin.\n\nPlace the fruit, butter, sugar, honey, coffee liqueur, orange zest and juice, mixed spice and cocoa into a large wide saucepan. Heat the mixture until it reaches a gentle boil, stirring the mixture as the butter melts. Let the mixture simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and leave to stand for 30 minutes.\n\nAfter 30 minutes, the mixture will have cooled a little. Add the eggs, flour, ground almonds, baking powder and baking soda, and mix well with a wooden spoon or spatula until the ingredients have combined.\n\nCarefully pour the fruitcake mixture into the lined cake tin. Transfer the cake tin to the oven and bake for 1 3/4 to 2 hours, or until the top of the cake is firm but will has a shiny and sticky look. At this point, if you insert a sharp knife into the middle of the cake, the cake should still be a little uncooked in the middle.\n\nPlace the cake on a cooling rack. Once the cake has cooled, remove it from the tin.\n\nTo decorate, place the chocolate-covered coffee beans in the centre of the cake and arrange the gold stars around the perimeter of the top of the cake. Then sprinkle some gold mini-balls over the whole cake and sprinkle the top with edible glitter.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-23T13:48:48+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"476979572353198","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Inseeay Hussain whats the wow factor","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-23T18:30:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1613763116","name":"Inseeay Hussain","type":"user","offset":0,"length":15}]},{"id":"476981005686388","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"whats so wow","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-23T18:34:03+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"476981579019664","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Haroon Leghari (Raja Indur) buss cigar haath mein and kuriyan bahon mein le kur muskurana choorain.\n\nhave one of your cakers make the cake for my aunt","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-23T18:35:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100000059823691","name":"Haroon Leghari","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]},{"id":"476985349019287","from":{"name":"Zarnak Sidhwa","id":"777488661"},"message":"i hv one ready... u wnt it marzipanned n fondant iced ke plain ????","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-23T18:42:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"476986629019159","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"NO fondant - she will slice my head off","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-23T18:46:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"476986759019146","from":{"name":"Zarnak Sidhwa","id":"777488661"},"message":"chokri, u take plain then ...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-23T18:47:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"476986905685798","from":{"name":"Zarnak Sidhwa","id":"777488661"},"message":"all eng fruit cakes cm with marzipan layer n a layer of fondant n mine is home-made not the marshmallowy one","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-23T18:47:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"476987709019051","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Pick up your desired cake from a Xmas fair...remind me tomorrow and will tell you where to go Doc...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-23T18:50:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"476987959019026","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Irfan Ismail why do i have to do the work - send the driver - and get it and have it sent to my place","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-23T18:50:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"476988762352279","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Better still, my mum is into all this Xmas fair stuff...call her and sort it out doc :-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-23T18:53:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"476989079018914","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"ok fine","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-23T18:54:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"477032509014571","from":{"name":"Naheed Ghulamhussain","id":"718233292"},"message":"Irfan Ismail, where is ths Christmasfair?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-23T20:58:37+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDc3MDMyNTA5MDE0NTcx","before":"NDc2NzMxNDY5MDQ0Njc1"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_476991675685321","from":{"name":"Shazia Carim","id":"677905296"},"message":"Chairman Mao home delivery !!
