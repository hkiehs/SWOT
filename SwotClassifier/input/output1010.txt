If at all. The calories from the protiens are not going to settle on the bum. They help burn the belly fat and cellulite. That\u0027s how High protein diets work. \n\nA cup of FroYo might be more than a 100 calories. But its only those that come from fats or sugars that need to be counted in a diet chart.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T03:54:20+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276361882414969","from":{"name":"Mehreen Obaid","id":"10403487"},"message":"a piece of sugar free gum  - extra - is 10 calories so a cup of frozen yogurt has to be much more i would think!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T09:25:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mjc2MzYxODgyNDE0OTY5","before":"Mjc2MDAwMDA5MTE3ODIz"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_275967045787786","from":{"name":"Sonya Khushi","id":"100001015066425"},"message":"Tried the amazing Belgian Chocolate FROYO at TUC just now. I don\u0027t think I can say anything more fantastic about that delicious delight that hasnt already been thought, said, written or discussed here. Best news I got was that the froyo is totally safe for people with diabetes! What a fabulous treat for my parents :) Had the hazelnut and pistachio gelato as well- yes no toppings. The owner told me that toppings were absolutely not allowed as the already fantastic gelato doesnt need any which is true ofcourse.
