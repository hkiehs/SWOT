The access to the place is narrow service lane. The shop has a small frontage and is deep inside. It appears that the shop belongs to someone in Management with vested interest.  As a result the outlet is congested and cramped. Either BK does not expect much clientele of dine in. At the main counter ordered meal deal for Whopper with cheese. During placing of order which was quick but observed that confusion prevails in the area. \nThe taste of Whopper was good but fries reminded me of Mojeebs near Jheel Park (no more there anymore). We sat down on sofa which were comfortable but the table was small and not enough to handle one tray. \nOn top of it,  the height of the table upto your face if you want to sit in the comfortable sofa. Could not fully enjoy the taste of burger due to ill planned furniture. \nThe crampness of the place and discomfort due to furniture gave the same feeling when having seekh kababs at Waheed Restaurant on Burns Road.\nWent to the washroom to assess the admin strength and capabilities. Total failure despite a new innovative cement washbasin. Due to poor flooring the water oozing out of muslim shower accumulated in front of the door making the shoes wet. There was no supervisor card to show when the washroom was checked. The wc was dirty and almost running out of toilet paper roll.    \nPoor brand management of a great brand.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-23T21:39:52+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-23T23:56:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1109359970","name":"Altaf Suleman"},{"id":"759025230","name":"Hassan Jan"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"531760529","name":"Neha Sarwar"},{"id":"612464159","name":"Zainab Atif Kabir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjEyNDY0MTU5","before":"MTEwOTM1OTk3MA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"656364954414658","from":{"name":"Umer Rashid","id":"849920390"},"message":"I just miss chicken jumbo burger of Mojeebs","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-23T23:56:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjU2MzY0OTU0NDE0NjU4","before":"NjU2MzY0OTU0NDE0NjU4"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_656133907771096","from":{"name":"Ali Sheikh","id":"586401160"},"message":"Hi SWOT\u0027s ...

I hate it when the filling is to less, I can feel the taste of bread in my mouth and I hate it when it is dripping down in every bite. \n\nHad the \"East Sider\" from LunchXpress today. \n\nFirstly the Garlic Foccacia Bread is to die for. Two thumbs up for the bread. Upon first sight, I thought, \"Hmm, the filling looks less\" BUT the first bite was all it took to change my opinion. I don\u0027t know what it was but it felt like the filling was marinated on the bread, it was THAT perfect. Just the right balance and the sandwich is good value for money since it fills you up too.\n\nThe spread gets brownie points by the way. I could taste chicken, there were onions that did not overpower the taste at all, the greens were well balanced as well. A must-have to-go option for lunch and otherwise as well. Well done team GD and Lunch Xpress!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-23T21:29:17+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-23T21:29:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"723085405","name":"Taha Zoeb"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"681193111","name":"Shiraz Sheikh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjgxMTkzMTEx","before":"Njk1Nzc2Mzkz"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_656248851092935","from":{"name":"Muhammad Aslam","id":"756768261"},"message":"Tried mutton burger at Burger Factory, it had a peculiar stink as the meat was probably not of goat rather of \" Dumba\" .
