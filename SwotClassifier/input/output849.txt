Finally ordered and food arrived in an hour after we reached, but once it was served all the pains were forgotten and we virtually drowned in the taste and flavor of the fish karahi, grilled and fried fish and the Chicken Malai boti and Behari Kabab, garlic nans and vegetable rice. Following that was sara\u0027s surprise desert neatly packed and presented with finesse, Shahi Tukra\u0027s, Caramel Egg pudding and Lab-i-Shireen, Shahi Tukra\u0027s were really sweet and well made with Zafraan, illachi and all the works, the caramel pudding was equally good. Lab-i-Shireen needs to be thicker and have some more ingredients in it to make it more original, another good option could be a mango based desert for the summers, even home made mango ice cream is a great option. The addition of desert is great as now one doesn\u0027t need rush elsewhere for desert after having Tsunami Prawns and can simply douse their taste buds with Shahi-i-Tukra\u0027s.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-17T10:10:37+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-18T19:02:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"667871448","name":"Sheikh Mohammad Faisal"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1473681227","name":"Shabnam Jabbar"},{"id":"543405800","name":"Tahir Wahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNDA1ODAw","before":"MTE5ODgzMTM3Ng\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"399296960121460","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Comprehensive review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T10:25:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399299070121249","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"I need dictionary\u0027s support to understand few words.

I went out to Biryani of the Seas (BOTS) last Sunday and it actually turned to be a gastronomical disaster. I was extremely disappointed because while the food wasn\u0027t horrible, this place came highly recommended by family and friends, however the food they served was nothing to write home about. Here are the highlights :\n\n1)Prawn Biryani :- We started off with a prawn biryani which we assumed to be a house speciality. They biryani that was served was unusually cold, had a very subtle hint of masala and had all of 7-8 tiny prawns (yes, I counted). I completely understand if the lack of prawn was due to the breeding season but our server said nothing of this sort to us when we ordered.\n\n2) Tawa Chicken : Things simply went downhill after the biryani. The Tawa chicken incorporated two pieces of burnt chicken and the chicken was also overcooked on the inside. I was a little confused by this dish because having had tawa chicken in other places, I assumed that they would use boneless chicken instead of a breast and a leg piece. Additionally, While I appreciated the nice kick that the dish had, the rest of the table thought that the extra spice was simply trying to overcompensate for what the dish lacked.\n\n3) Leather jacket fillet : While the fish was perfectly cooked, I couldn\u0027t even detect a hint of flavour in it, not sure if the Tawa chicken had sabotaged my taste buds by this time but this dish felt oddly plain.\n\nOn a more positive note, the honey chilli prawns were satisfactory and the assorted chicken bbq made it worth our while to dine here but on the whole BOTS turned out to be a disappointing experience. I am not sure if I caught them during an off-night or if my expectations were too highly but BOTS failed to live up to hype for me.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-16T21:42:50+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-18T15:53:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"100002402711136","name":"Tazeen Hasan"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2","before":"MTAwMDAxODU4NDUwMDEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"399064373478052","from":{"name":"Khalid Ishaq","id":"680185313"},"message":"Quite a\nSimilar experience\nHad food poisoning after my first visit to BOTS n on d second trip ordered tawa chicken which was almost burnt","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T21:53:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399066506811172","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"To each his own....I eat BOTS 3 times a week...no problem so far","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T21:59:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399094416808381","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Looks like i spoke to soon about not getting complaints for a while on SWOTS :) - But Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
