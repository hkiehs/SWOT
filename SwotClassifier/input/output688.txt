I say newly since I hadn\u0027t had the opportunity to visit this place when it opened up. \nThe place \" REEM EXPRESS\" to be specific, serves arabic food and since I have a great love of the cuisine, we opted to order a mix platter (half), just to try out. The platter had an assortment of sheesh taouq, chicken and mutton arabic kebabs, mutton chops and chicken boti, all for a price of around rs 550-600. We added a side order of plain humous and season salad which rounded upto a total of rs 1070. After waiting for 10mins, the platter which my hubby brought to the table left me speechless. \n\nThe salad was dry with 3 slices of tomatoes, stale iceberg, lettuce and green leaves of spring onions. A small container holding some orange sauce was there as a dressing. The humous was ok but absoloutely tasteless as compared to the ones we get in tin cans. Next the platter it self. The platter was wrapped in a huge chapati, which when turned over, revealed a sad assortment. A micro sized mutton chop with absolutely no meat on it, 3 micro sized botis, and a small piece each of chicken and mutton kebab with few fries, awaited us. The first bite that we took was enough to make anyone throw up since the meat was not cooked and it smelled so bad that its amazing how we managed to even taste everything. I am surprised at the quality of food that is being served at this joint since it\u0027s charging an arm and a leg for a meal that I feel is not even fit for human consumption. \nMy husband and I left the place feeling nauseous and I am sure that I won\u0027t be able to eat anything else for at least a whole day.\n\nI therefore hope that my message is conveyed to the concerned people of REEM EXPRESS and appeal that kindly make sure whatever you are serving is at least fresh and the meat is fit for consumption. Further more I would also like to point out that people come to such places to enjoy their meals with families. Also, rather than cheating a man off his earnings, Please make sure that the quantity of food that you are serving for a single person should at least compliment the price that you are charging for the meal.       \n\nThanks.\nA dissatisfied customer!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-14T18:34:24+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-16T10:35:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001011410786","name":"Shaban Ali Nagri"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"1105593436","name":"Atif Asif"},{"id":"557216100","name":"Vikki Mohsin"},{"id":"100000271785679","name":"Farhan Sultan"},{"id":"504592087","name":"Kanwal Anes Ahmed"},{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid"},{"id":"641497321","name":"Adil Sartaj"},{"id":"613037941","name":"Faiza Afzal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjEzMDM3OTQx","before":"MTAwMDAxMDExNDEwNzg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"472718019446020","from":{"name":"Akbar Khan","id":"100000245074195"},"message":"This post kept me wondering why the hell people invest in the resto business without a passion for food..This leads to dissatisfied customers and a bad taste in the mouth of those who read it too.Hope this is a responsible post.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-14T18:43:31+0000","like_count":9,"user_likes":false},{"id":"472731629444659","from":{"name":"Umme Hamdani","id":"592813967"},"message":"Opening up a place in dolmen mall is not cheap.
