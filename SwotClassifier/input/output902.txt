Enjoy!\n\nToday was my first time attending a blogger\u0027s meet at the soon-to-open Bella Vita. So exciting! Located right next to the Pizza Hut lane at Zamzama, this outlet is difficult to miss with its massive awning. Even with my lack of direction sense, I managed to make it without any difficulty at all. Upon entering, I had to silently admit to myself that this was one prettily dressed up place. It gave a very warm, welcoming vibe, where you can just imagine sitting yourself at a corner table in the comfy chair large enough to fit two people (At least for me) for as long as you wish to, with a cup of your favorite coffee and a good book. There was wooden paneling, tasteful painting interspersed along the walls, and amidst all the masculine brown paneling, femininely attired chandeliers hung at various intervals from the wooden ceiling. There was enough seating to accommodate a party of six or a table for two, interspersed with an assortment of comfortable looking lounging-type chairs, and the regular wooden chairs. \n\nUpon meeting the owners, I could see that the welcoming and comfortable atmosphere of Bella Vita was a reflection of their personalities. More than willing to please, they were easy to talk to and eager to note my novice opinions on their establishment. I also met Zehra here for the first time, which was a lovely experience. I learnt from her the art of taste-testing gelato. I digress however, and will come back to that in a bit. We were told that currently the menu was completely devoted to desserts and beverages, but they are planning on expanding the menu with other items in the future. We were also told that all their ingredients are imported from Italy, and fresh berries are imported every other day from Dubai, the assortment depending on the availability. The strawberries were massive, and the blueberries tasted just as they should. Sweet and juicy little morsels, fresh as you could hope for. They had 17 choices of gelato to choose from, including sugar-free vanilla and chocolate. Let me tell you, I was stumped. I wanted to try all of them, but nightmares of what it would do to my waistline held me back. Zehra however, was my inspiration for the taste-testing method. A teaspoon of each flavor was placed around a plate, and a glass of water to cleanse the palate was provided. Then began the taste-testing. The flavors that really, really made a home in my heart have to be After Eight, Lemon Sorbet, Chocolate, Caramel, and Chocolate Orange. And here\u0027s some massively stupendous news for those of you who say no to sugar. Are you ready to hear it? The sugar-free chocolate and vanilla tasted exactly the same as the regular chocolate and vanilla. I know, right? It\u0027s crazy. You have to go try it out for yourselves.\n\nNow, as for the menu, I didn\u0027t really thoroughly study it, but I did manage to find out that the regular size for the gelato serving is 60 grams, and price is Rs. 140. Along with the gelato, everything else on the menu also seemed to be extremely reasonably priced for the quality of the desserts being served and the ambiance. Free wi-fi too! \n\nAll in all, today\u0027s visit was a pleasure, and I can\u0027t wait to visit again. Best of luck, and keep it up, team Bella Vita!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-17T19:04:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-18T11:35:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"200900469","name":"Hassan Ashfaq"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"1079332060","name":"Farheen Omer"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"508350324","name":"Fatima Sattar Chawla"},{"id":"685460614","name":"Nida Sattar-Saad"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"MjAwOTAwNDY5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"381150678602755","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Paintings*","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T19:06:52+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"381265508591272","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Another novella!!!!!

I know my reviews tend to go on like there\u0027s no tomorrow, but I like to relate my entire experience, not just the food.\nAyesha, it was wonderful to be there. Thanks so much to you and Hassan for the invitation.\nZehra, you\u0027re a sweetheart. Too, too kind. It was an absolute delight to meet you, and it wouldn\u0027t have been as much fun if you hadn\u0027t been there. Looking forward to more meeting uppings with you.\nAdnaan, you\u0027ve been my virtual SWOT buddy for a while now. An actual meetup is definitely due. Small cute chick is what people mostly think of me...till I lose my temper. That title will be discussed in person. Lol.\nSaira, I got my invitation 2 days before the event. It sucks that you couldn\u0027t make it.\nMr. Joe, thank you for your gracious comments. I tend to focus more on writing and letting the readers imagination do the illustration work.

We ordered the Nachos for starters and I was quite disappointed. The salsa and cheese served on the side was in teeny tiny bowls, although the serving of tortilla chips was generous. We had to ask for extra salsa, which they were happy to provide. I may be wrong, but the chips tasted like store bought chips? For our main course we ordered Philly Cheesesteak and their new Tex Mex Burger. I didn\u0027t like the Philly Cheesesteak, I thought the steak was too chewy, but I did really like the sauce. The burger was fantastic. We also ordered Vanilla shakes to go with our meal and they were creamy and perfect. Good service and the staff was very helpful, but the cafe was a little too warm (I don\u0027t think their AC was functioning properly).

The place is STUNNING!! From the walls (faux leather panels wid embroidery detailing) to the lights, to the sofas (again with the embroidered detailing) to the decor.... Extremely soothing is the ambiance. They have a deserts, drinks and coffee menu only at the moment but boy-o-boy does it rock! Their regular serving of gelato is 60 grams roughly for Rs 140, large is 120 grams for  Rs 250. They also offer Xlarge, 1/2 liter and liter potions. And their premiums (sugar free etc) start at Rs 165 for 60 grams. They have an amazing assortment of toppings tat vary from sauces, Rochers, shortbread biscuits etc. Their deserts start at an amazing price of Rs 250 onwards which is VERY reasonable in today\u0027s market. tried all their ice creams and can say without a doubth.....all other gelatories better start bracing themselves. Not only does this place look Individual with it\u0027s identity, it\u0027s products stand out as well!
