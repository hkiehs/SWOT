And of course, i dont even have to say anything about the ambiance.\nTried the Double-(something) Steak this time. Was cooked to perfection. The black pepper sauce and the terragon sauce was spot on.\nFor anyone who loves steak, definitely try them at Charcoal.\nI will going going back soon for sure.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-16T19:52:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-16T19:52:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE2OTk1NDIx","before":"MjcyMDkyMw\u003d\u003d"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_558178237566664","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Fat Fries, Crispy Chicken and Jalapeño Double Beef","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-16T17:19:29+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-16T18:59:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1463201564","name":"ArtScene Galleries"},{"id":"201004010","name":"Saiem Nasir"},{"id":"1399262287","name":"Zahra Shahid"},{"id":"682446717","name":"Amna Tauqeer"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"1367979764","name":"Shamsi Zia"},{"id":"502557411","name":"Omer Saeed"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"522705412","name":"Marvi Shah"},{"id":"581600364","name":"Salman Millwala"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTgxNjAwMzY0","before":"MTQ2MzIwMTU2NA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"558191794231975","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"Is bun ki phook kis nay nikali","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-16T17:42:19+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"558197317564756","from":{"name":"Sania Lakhani","id":"1667656022"},"message":"lol @ Najam Quddusi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-16T17:51:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi","type":"user","offset":6,"length":13}]},{"id":"558220934229061","from":{"name":"Shamsi Zia","id":"1367979764"},"message":"farburger is always liked by .....:) smart people","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-16T18:59:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTU4MjIwOTM0MjI5MDYx","before":"NTU4MTkxNzk0MjMxOTc1"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_558217537562734","from":{"name":"Amna Tauqeer","id":"682446717"},"message":"YUM introduces  its  melt-in-your-mouth French macarons  .
