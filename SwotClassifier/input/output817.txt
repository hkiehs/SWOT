So when the bill came, two desserts were double ie 55 extra each and one was 40 extra. So we called the guy and asked him to explain and he kept insisting that he said it would be different to the bakery price and Rs20-30 extra. So when my husband tried explaining to him that you shouldn\u0027t quote an amount, he didn\u0027t understand what we were trying to explain and got angry.

I had not tried their awesome deals in SWOT-a-cake event but I did drool over the platters that were served to others. So we decided last night to give it a shot. \n\nPlaying it safe, we stuck to the SWOT\u0027s recommendations, and ordered the Grilled Chilliz platter, Chilliz Beef Burger, Steak Sandwich and Chicken Lasagna. The platter and the accompanying sauces were scrumptious. Irfan enjoyed his Chilliz Beef Burger (although I thought the patty was a little overcooked, hence not juicy enough), but I totally loved my Steak Sandwich. The kids, after having devoured most of the platter, had little room for the lasagna, hence could not finish it, but they loved their food too. \n\nThey also shared an Oreo shake which they say was great.. My blue colada was just ok. I could not really taste the blueberry, and there was too much food colour. There was a bit too much ice in the drink which made sipping quite a task. \n\nOverall experience was good, and I felt bad that throughout our stay there, we were the only diners there. Grilled Chilliz has a buy one get one free deal on lunch entrees while it is also coming up with some great Iftari deals.

The place has 180 seats at three different levels inc a lounge. We started off with Roasted Tomato and Broccoli Soup, for starters we had Spinach and Artichoke Dip, were also served complimentary bread basket, warm and fresh bread, the Soup was good topped with goat\u0027s cheese and well flavored. Main course comprised of Kalamata Chicken – Marinated chicken with kalamata, green olives and sun-dried tomatoes and \nGrilled Fillet of Chicken with Rocket Grilled chicken topped with rocket leaves drizzled in delicate garlic olive served with Sautéed mushrooms and vegetable timbale. The food was served hot and excellent presentation but the meat needed to be a tad bit more tender. For drinks we had Falsa Juice less sugar, a bit sour but authentic not artificial in flavor. Last but not the least desert was Warm Apple crumble with Ice cream, baked apple pie was a bit hard and required an effort to break but combined with Ice cream was delicious. Service was excellent, staff was polite, attentive and the manager was kind enough to ask us \"How was your meal\". One of the reasons for me to swot this place was to have an objective analysis as to how well team Aylanto is performing! after reading many negative reviews and not many reviews these days, Aylanto finally seems to be on track now, after weathering the storms, as the place was packed with people and they kept coming and coming till about 2:15 pm......which means they are delivering on quality of service.....only one thing seriously needs to be looked into, that is when the bill was presented it was simply on a piece paper with GST being charged at 16% and no proper bill was given with a valid GST no. The server was called and he gave the excuse that the machine was out of order, then the manager was summoned and he gave the excuse that the accountant is not present, and if we need the proper bill we will have to wait, as it will take HALF AND HOUR, then he under took the responsibility to have the bill delivered to our give address, we advised him to make it, scan it, and email it us, he committed he would do so, but unfortunately even after a passage of three hours when I write these lines no proper bill has been emailed. Cafe Aylanto which is one of the most prestigious and respected restaurants in Karachi, has done very well on all counts accept this one. This is a serious matter which they need to investigate and get back asap. If I am being charged GST, it is my right as a customer to insure that it is being accounted for in the proper manner, and not only charged, but accounted for and deposited in the respective gop account. This is not an allegation but an observation, early also they presented a bill which was on a piece of paper and not a properly printed one with GST no, complaint lodged and no action was taken which does not reflect well on this establishment. I am sure someone would like to clarify this issue.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-19T12:49:46+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-19T12:49:46+0000"},{"id":"165861103465048_414307111953778","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"If u had an invitation for lunch with the following options Xander\u0027s, butlers @ dolmen, aylanto which one would u choose and why?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-18T21:26:16+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-19T12:36:07+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"414308028620353","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"xanders or aylanto.

Our premise was to find a relaxing quiet place where we could catch up on our conversation. So we sat in the lounge which was empty when we arrived. We selected from the lounge deal as we wanted something quick and simple. I took the Beef Burger \u0026 Bread Pudding deal while she selected the Grill chicken and Caramel pudding. I was happy with my plate and loved the Bread pudding but just found the helping tad too small esp. after having eaten huge portions at Forty 4 and CBG. Then again it could be because it was part of a deal hence size has been reduced (my own presumption). My friend found the Grill Chicken dry and without seasoning and she requested for some sauce. The server brought her some tarragon sauce and then she said it was much better. Service was good, very effusive and alert. We froze as the guests on our opposite table wanted the AC on full blast and the vent which could not be diverted was directed towards us…eventually we inched away to the right side of the table so we could avoid the blast. (We did mentioned this to the server who apologized and informed us about the vent)  On the whole a relaxing dinner and gupshup.","type":"photo","created_time":"2012-07-19T06:58:09+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-19T11:19:30+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"414488591935630","from":{"name":"Amjad Anwar","id":"100003647628785"},"message":"Thank You mam; Yes this our lounge deal for 539/+, It has a soft drink plus the snack and a dessert.
