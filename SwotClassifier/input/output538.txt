The calamari was very good but I didn\u0027t care for the dip accompanying it, would have preferred either something lighter or something more soy saucy. The beef salad was disappointing, the beef was a bit over cooked and hard and the flavours did not blend together very well, probably missing some fish sauce. Shanghai noodles were not bad but probably not something I would order again. My taste buds have forever been spoilt by the udon noodles with straw and shiitake mushrooms, bak choy and beautiful pieces of beef which I would dine on in Shanghai. \nPrices were on the higher end and a meal for 2 cost us about 3500 (3 starters and 1 main). \n\nWould I go back again?

Chose \u0027California-Mushroom Cheese Burger\u0027 and \u0027Little Dangerous\u0027 (both beef burgers). The Experience? Really good! Food was delivered in exactly 50 minutes as communicated. Very courteous rider! The burgers tasted great, really juicy for a normal beef burger. Even Hardees doesn\u0027t come close to their burgers. Awesome deal, so worth the price too. Thanks BTB! You have just won a happy customer!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-20T18:37:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-22T12:04:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"565971513","name":"Ali Abbas"},{"id":"731410527","name":"Aziz Noorani"},{"id":"1377186173","name":"Owais Mahmood"},{"id":"1473814341","name":"Amna Billoo"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1059103092","name":"Rao Mohd Ali"},{"id":"775921843","name":"Saad Amanullah Khan"},{"id":"728371533","name":"Ismaa Khan"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzMzcxOTYzMA\u003d\u003d","before":"NTY1OTcxNTEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"544637328920755","from":{"name":"Saad Amanullah Khan","id":"775921843"},"message":"Thankyou Shumyla Jawaid, I am glad you like our BTB.
