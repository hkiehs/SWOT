A few lapses to be noted while giving the order. Had to repeat my order 3 times before the guy completely understood what I wanted. Secondly, no plastic money accepted, as of yet. So that was a little bummer.\nReceived my order in under 15-18 minutes. Good enough.\nWhen receiving the order, I asked whether or not there is the additional Tribeca Sauce topping that I asked (and paid) for. Apparently, they forgot that. No problem. Happens. But instead of adding that to the burger, they gave it to me as a dip.\nNow as for the burgers, yes the Tribeca Twins tasted good. But that\u0027s it. The burger tasted just....\"good\". Yes it is the only place as of yet the patty of which reminds you of Mr. Burger (which I think has THE most unique beef patty). The burger was good. Some would definitely call it brilliant. They have every right to call it so. But to me personally, it was just....lacking that \"kick\" which could make it an \"outstanding\" burger.\nAs for the Fried Chicken Fillet Burger, it was yet another experience. Hands down, THE most well-cooked piece of chicken I\u0027ve had in my burger in ages. The time for which it was kept in the fryer, brilliant. Juicy, soft, moist; I can go on and on as to the quality of the chicken and the way it was cooked.\nThe fries though, for Rs. 100 were yet again just....\"okay\". Nothing exceptional about them as well.\n\nSo, would I visiting Burger Inc. again? Definitely. As I said, it\u0027s not at all bad. It\u0027s good. It\u0027s nice.\nWould I be expecting Burger Inc. to surprise me with its flavor? Sadly, no.\nBut that\u0027s just about me and my own taste buds.\n\nOnto the next experience, which was yesterday, at Del Frio. I\u0027ve read posts of many different members having rough days at Del Frio, ranging from rude staff to over-cooked/burnt pizza base, but in all honesty, yesterday was my 7th or 8th visit at their SMCHS outlet and I am yet to experience a bad day with them. I\u0027ve been visiting Del Frio at that outlet from the time they didn\u0027t even have the credit/debit-card machines (starting days) and my orders have ranged from pizzas to sandwiches, coffees to slushes (which they call \"XYZ ice\", depending on the flavors) and everything everytime has not just been consistent but remarkably tasty as well. Yesterday, the outlet was fairly full and I ordered my usual there, which was the Hot n Spicy pizza and the Hazelnut Cappuccino. The pizza was yum. As always. The cappuccino, though not the best I\u0027ve had in K-Town (I enjoy Bella Vita\u0027s and ESPRESSO\u0027s Hazelnut Cappuccino THE most, and noone else comes close), but was just the way it always serves.\nI agree many of you have had bad times at Del Frio, but I really haven\u0027t had any such experience from them as of yet.\n\nEat on people!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-06T01:32:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-06T01:32:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001249191882","name":"Fozia Amjad"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"514392526","name":"Mahnaz Fahad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE0MzkyNTI2","before":"MTAwMDAxMjQ5MTkxODgy"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_645585518825935","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Yesterday evening I took a take away from BBq tonite, I am sorry to report the BBQ was not at all good, I had ordered Afghani Kebab Chicken,Malai Boti, Sheesh Touk, all the items were bland and lacked flavor the Afghani Kebab was hard and cold from inside, I never had such an experience in BBq tonite ever before been a regular since 1988, I don\u0027t know what has happened?
