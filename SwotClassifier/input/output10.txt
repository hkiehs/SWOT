My friend came across \"The Saucy Mistress\" while surfing on Facebook and ofcourse, for people like me, who cant eat their daal chawal without lassan and raita, the page was simply a chutney lover\u0027s delight. \n\nI am always on the lookout for the perfect dip for my Lays Salt and Vinegar chips.. so I decided to get their Two Days in Parts dip which boring people call French Onion Dip. The thickness and richness of the dip was mouth-watering.. \n\nThen for my daal chaawal, I decided to try Maula Jatt! which was their Lassan Chutney and since I got a lil bit more greedy I also got the Green Card Fever which is commonly known as the Coconut Cilantro Chutney. Teehee. The freshness of the lassan, cilanto and coconut in both the chutneys is clearly noticeable. \n\nMy friend, on the other hand is a coffee lover, so she got Up, their Tiramisu dip. It looks so thick, rich and delicious, but unfortunately I didnt get to taste it so I cant give a verdict. \n\nOne thing I LOVE about The Saucy Mistress is that her innovative  and hilarious menu makes you want to keep going back to her Facebook page and reading it out loud and she is always so positive, encouraging and shares the making process of the chutneys on her Facebook page. \n\nSpeaking of which, she doesn\u0027t just make chutneys. Her diverse list includes Cooking Sauces, Dips, Dressings for Salads and Desserts.\n\nMust must try for all!

First time i tried red riding hood bakery ferrero rocher cake when the bakery had recently opened, the cake was yummy and the ferrero\u0027s were crispy and fresh. 2nd time i tried snickers cake which had stale peanuts. Then again I bought Ferrero Rocher cake in ramadan 2013 and the ferrero\u0027s and hazelnuts were badly stale. I decided not to buy cakes from this bakery as the pricing is high end and cakes were consistently stale. However after we saw the new advertisement with stunning pictures of the variety of cakes at this bakery I committed the sin of ordering belgian chocolate cake. The cake was stale and crumbly, the frosting is more butter cream and conceals all the goodness of belgian chocolate, if at all the frosting did contain belgian chocolate. Only the sides of the cake (tempered chocolate) tasted belgian. Waste of money and calories!","type":"photo","created_time":"2014-01-07T12:20:27+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-08T19:20:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"792915494","name":"Ahmad Fayyaz Ali"},{"id":"745469021","name":"Hiba Ali"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"500883930","name":"Saira Inam"},{"id":"100001602140079","name":"Sùfyan Shaíkh"},{"id":"100000821282488","name":"Erum Shoaib"},{"id":"585445861","name":"Mehak Nayani"},{"id":"100001803662044","name":"Zarmeen Jameel"},{"id":"1176961934","name":"Muneeba Motiwala"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"607755094","name":"Fareena Lodhi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA3NzU1MDk0","before":"NzkyOTE1NDk0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"678880935496393","from":{"name":"Fareena Lodhi","id":"607755094"},"message":"Totally agree with you Sara Lodhi.

Secondly, we dont use butter cream in our frosting at all, All the cakes are made by melting original chocolates, the belgian is a mix of both Milk and dark chocolate, dark on the outside and milk on the top and inside. We use barry Callibaut couverture, you can google it to find out, its a high end brand used in making chocolates and frosting. Im unable to understand where did you find the butter in belgian. People have different opinion about products but I guess you should confirm it from the makers what ingredients they are using. Also I would like to highlight we never make ganash and coat over something else, you can dissect the cake to see whats outside is inside. Having said that, we dont want to disregard your complain, you must bring the cake to the bakery, we will listen to your complain and compensate you if there is a mistake at our end and make sure your money is not gone wasted.

For us Belgium chocolate means, Cort D\u0027OR, Guylian, Godiva etc. Using Barry Callibaut couverture totally depends on who the chef/ baker is and from where the sourcing is being done. Most of the stuff available with retailers and looking at the price of riding hood bakery\u0027s cake, the couverture being used is of the lowest quality available with most retailers; that explains the butter cream like texture and taste. Secondly next time tell the guests before serving the cake that we will take turns tasting the cake to make sure stale cake is returned to the bakery.....lolz or better still stick to our former favorites such as flo\u0027s orange chocolate, Neco\u0027s twix cheese, Espresso\u0027s chocolate cake, pie in the sky\u0027s Lemon cake etc. I\u0027m really surprised at the customer service concept at some places; customer is the king, customer is always right are cliche\u0027 terms when the number of customers is increasing..... Customer doesn\u0027t have high end taste, customer is a liar are in vogue :) now I\u0027m a little curious how are you going to get the Belgium cake out of the stomachs of the guests it was served to and take it back to the bakery?

I think i can tell stale nuts and stale ferrero being a chocolate junkie. Let me tell you i complained at each subsequent visit and the lady at khadda market outlet said and i quote \"yes maam we got multiple complaints and now we use fresh imported chocolates only\". Even when ordering belgian on sunday i confirmed on phone n told the guy about stale nuts in last 2 cakes. I am writing only after 3 consecutive ( 3 consecutive can be called hatrick asif ali) bad cake experiences and noone at the outlet offering any consolation. I wrote tempered chocolate and no where did i mention ganache, also i thought that frosting that sticks to the top of your palate is butter cream, also i googled the product u use and this variant of belgian chocolate has a lot of cocoa butter which chefs say splits apart when u hear the chocolate, that explains what i tasted. i might not be a food connoisseur but I have been to belgium and tried many belgian chocolates which taste quite different but im not doubting what you use in your cake only saying that goodness of the belgian chocolat was concealed in the cake i got. Also the fact is that cake was falling apart crumbs everywhere and was 100% stale and all my guests had the same opinion. Service industry needs to improve, a group of colleagues had a bad experience at pizza hut where a full grown big roach was an added topping on the supreme pizza at chundrigar some 3 yrs back and the management really didnt do anything to repent (i have 13 witnesses and we even took pictures and wrote a complaint to the local and international management, no response). PH is doing well and has a growing customer base. At another restaurant olivetto grill a guest complained that grilled fish serving size has been reduced and voila there was complimentary serving of a full platter of grilled fish and bread pudding (even though the person who complained had finished his food when making the plaint thus no evidence was offered). Olivetto is not doing well but definitely they have a good service culture.  Your business is thriving with new outlet at sehr and counter at tee emm so losing 1 customer might not be a big deal but you can google brand management and service culture and you will find that each customer is important. As far as brand bashing is concerned, all posts on this forum are approved by admin and both good and bad reviews are posted. Having said this i will continue to try the cakes at the red riding hood as i have twix and after eight on my list of cakes to try. If i get a stale cake again, i will save a slice and make an effort to drive back to the outlet and submit evidence.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-08T06:38:15+0000","like_count":14,"user_likes":false},{"id":"679318902119263","from":{"name":"Hiba Ali","id":"745469021"},"message":"Had a really  bad experience too , my fiance ordered for me the same belgian chocolate cake for my birthday with my picture on it.

Tried the newly launched Burger Lab soon after its launch today. Ordered a Double Patty Mushroom Cloud Burger which had their own cooked mushroom sauce, a cheese slice and two big fat beef patties sandwiched in the Lab\u0027s Bun (that\u0027s what the menu board said although I saw them using the \u0027Hyperstar k Buns\u0027). The meat was juicy and succulent in taste while the freshly made mushroom sauce was just in the right quantity as not to spoil the taste of beef patties. The spice level was on the lower side which karachiites would probably not like. The bun, however, was a major turnoff which was dry and crumbling (this has always been a problem with Hyperstar\u0027s Bread). I was at least expecting BL\u0027s freshly baked buns. The prices were competitive to all the local offerings with an option to add on the patties for just Rupees 80  for one.\n\nThe people on other side of the counter were friendly and well informed who took the order patiently despite the rush outside. The meal was ready within 15 minutes, although the waiting time communicated initially was about 20. They had mistakenly delivered a single patty burger which was later compensated with another double patty one (yeah, you got it right, I got two burgers :P). I will give them a benefit of doubt because of the rush.\n\nOverall experience 7.5 on 10. Only if they start using better quality buns and retain their quality, they might actually give The Burger Shack a run.","type":"photo","created_time":"2014-01-08T18:26:46+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-08T19:14:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"743148089","name":"Asad Abdul Muhammad"},{"id":"515483096","name":"Samar Yasir"},{"id":"556128383","name":"Taha Faruqui"},{"id":"500778016","name":"Hammad Munir"},{"id":"623717272","name":"Anum Abrar Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjIzNzE3Mjcy","before":"NzQzMTQ4MDg5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"679520725432414","from":{"name":"Omer Naeem","id":"771972485"},"message":"n whr exactly is it? it is for the love of food r BL\u0027s tht good kay ur writing a review whn infact u shud b studying for exam?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-08T18:45:14+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"679522832098870","from":{"name":"Abdul Basit Memon","id":"537798684"},"message":"Lol .
