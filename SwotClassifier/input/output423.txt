Nice little place, not very spacious but has a courteous staff. The owner/manager helped us choose our order. I guess he figured out from our facial expressions that the limited menu had us a bit confused. We ordered mint and pea soup, tomatoe soup, some chicken appitizer (forgot the name). Burrito bowl wid mango salsa, thai chicken curry and mango pavlova. The food was seasoned to perfection. Loved all the dishes except the appitizer that was a bit oily and the dessert coz the cream and mangoes werent chilled. Overall nice experience. Will visit again. And plz try the burrito bowl. It\u0027s worth all the money.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-06T11:35:52+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-06T11:35:52+0000"},{"id":"165861103465048_581268505257637","from":{"name":"Umtus Sanna Hussain-Mirza","id":"528525436"},"message":"Cafe Subhani equivalent found in isloo!In fact i think their chello kebabs were better than Subhani\u0027s!
