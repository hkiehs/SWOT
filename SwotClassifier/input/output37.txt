It took me about 10 minutes to decide what I wanted to have because I\u0027m usually very indecisive when it comes to alot of options so finally I decided to go with this one. \n The sundae had a big topping of whipped cream with nuts and caramel, inside was freshly baked brownie which was chewy and yummmy! and it had vanilla and chocolate icecream obvious from the name and big swirls of cookie dough, cookie dough in a dessert? Heaven on earth! It was for Rs. 365 where a scoop of icecream was for Rs. 210 so this sundae definitely was worth it. I enjoyed it so much that a lady from across the table had to come and ask me what I was having and from where did I get it :D\n  I\u0027m happy that people are finally giving much attention to good desserts because I always felt restaurants didnt give much thought to the desserts and ignoring the fact that the last dish usually leaves a lasting impression.

I was a little skeptical about the delivery time and the quantities of each item whether it would be enough for 6 people or not but anyhow I just went with my instinct. The order was delivered in one hour fifteen minutes and the food was piping hot and neatly packed. The quantities were HUGE!!! The wontons were juicy and the sweet and sour prawns were spot on delicious. I loved the balance of spices in the chicken and pineapple gravy. Overall an amazing experience! We still haven\u0027t touched the chowmein and more than half of the chicken curry and a huge serving of egg fried rice is left. Will defnitely order again and highly recommend it for those who want to enjoy good Chinese food within the cozy atmosphere of their homes. :-)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-20T18:38:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-20T21:40:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"523879073","name":"Aeisha Anver Khan"},{"id":"100004686481833","name":"Sidra Dadabhoy-Khurshid"},{"id":"557667783","name":"Jabeen Sohail"},{"id":"675928338","name":"Anum Zehra Raza"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"622165739","name":"Sumi Azmat"},{"id":"521665060","name":"Afsah Bhutta"},{"id":"753624574","name":"Shazmeen Raza"},{"id":"675514809","name":"Muhammad Wasiq Paracha"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"100002068418798","name":"Sumaira Junaid"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1130495392","name":"Ismail Mohiuddin Zakaria"},{"id":"523153232","name":"Hira Humayun"},{"id":"100000595182709","name":"Umair Chaudhry UC"},{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"786305656","name":"Anila Anjum"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"507563555","name":"Sara Omran"},{"id":"713750410","name":"Usman Rehman"},{"id":"1599844454","name":"Madiha Ahmed"},{"id":"1552939842","name":"Saba Hasan"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"100000174273390","name":"Faraz Haider"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwMTc0MjczMzkw","before":"NTIzODc5MDcz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_669605173090636/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dMTAwMDAwMTc0MjczMzkw"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"669663976418089","from":{"name":"Syeda Tehseen Zehra Naqvi","id":"100002971695699"},"message":"Abeer Ahsan see golden dragon\u0027s review.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-20T21:02:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100000738177003","name":"Abeer Ahsan","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"669680606416426","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Qamarunnisa Asim","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-20T21:40:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","type":"user","offset":0,"length":16}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY5NjgwNjA2NDE2NDI2","before":"NjY5NjYzOTc2NDE4MDg5"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_669573876427099","from":{"name":"Zafeer Ahmed Yazdani","id":"535301722"},"message":"Hi all... a good place to get an awsome cake delivered home for an occasion such as 25th Wed Anniversary ??","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-20T17:14:07+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-20T20:47:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"723286718","name":"Anadil Farooqi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzIzMjg2NzE4","before":"NzIzMjg2NzE4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"669582086426278","from":{"name":"Hirah Sid","id":"514290400"},"message":"Smackin Treats03432428985","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-20T17:36:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"669585596425927","from":{"name":"Fareha Zarsheen","id":"612250309"},"message":"Riding hood bakery","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-20T17:45:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"669591753091978","from":{"name":"Fareeha Mohsin","id":"100000292462952"},"message":"Made this one for a 50th!
