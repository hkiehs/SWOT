We ordered starters and 4 steaks. 2 Classis steaks (both medium well) and 2 Red Hot Fire steaks (one medim well and one medium rare no cheese). 3 were ordered with fries and the \u0027no cheese\u0027 one with mashed potatoes (for my wife). The place wasn\u0027t that busy, still, to ensure we get what we wanted, my wife repeated the order to the server, who quite patronisingly repeated it back by constantly butting in and speaking over her. He told us it would be 20-25 minutes to the main so we asked him to bring the drinks straight away.\n\nStarters arrived but no drinks. We requested again for drinks, but nothing for another 10 minutes. Eventualy, after asking for them about four the fourth time the drinks arrived. \n\nWe we devoured the starters instantly and anxiously waited for our steaks.\n\nA few minutes later the steaks arrived and that is when the chaos began. First we got all steak with chips and no mashed potato, which my wife had asked for. So they took away her plate and returned it, replacing the chips with mashed potatoes. Eventually we tucked into our steak and discovered that mine was medium rare and my wife\u0027s was medium well (more to the well side). This was quite annoying as, in this toing and froing, our meals had started to get cold so, we asked to see the server who took our order as he had condescendingly assured us that he knew what he was doing. Amazingly by that time that server was nowhere to be seen. Anyway, as I was extremely hungry, I carelessly started scoffing it while my wife asked hers to be replaced.\n\nFive minutes later the server came back with another plate of steak for my wife, she asked him to wait for a second so she could check its condition, and to her dismay this one was even worse as it was \u0027well done\u0027. That\u0027s when she demanded to see the manager who offered to replace it once again with a proper \u0027medium rare\u0027 but by this time she had had enough and decided to cancel her order altogether and demanded that we are not charged for the steak. The Manager sheepishly agreed and went away with not even an apology.\n\nThe servers were just busy talking to each other and were not at all concerned about the service.\n\nThe three of us cleaned our plates, the steaks were delicious, while my poor wife sat there drooling.\n\nWhen we got the bill my wife asked me to check whether the cancelled steak was on the bill or not, and to my amazement, they HAD charged us. We immediately sent it back and paid the revised bill.\n\nWe were all quite upset with the last stunt they tried to pull by agreeing to exclude the cancelled item and then discreetly adding it.\n\nI don\u0027t know if anyone else has had a bad experience as in general the reviews have been quite good. \n\nAll round very bad experience and we will not be going to Gunsmoke again. Bad service to the extreme.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-13T16:22:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-13T21:47:33+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100001857259546","name":"Umer Awan"},{"id":"707813675","name":"Maheen Mansoor"},{"id":"617371190","name":"Samar Mughal"},{"id":"691451746","name":"Ayaz Sheikh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjkxNDUxNzQ2","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"602644853120002","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Nadeem Ansari go back there once more and try the ribs...u won\u0027t regret it","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T16:28:37+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"676027378","name":"Nadeem Ansari","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"602647783119709","from":{"name":"Nadeem Ansari","id":"676027378"},"message":"We were there last year and had burgers which were absolutely delicious.

A lot has been written about it already, and it is probably one of the very few places which has an impeccable service record -- yet to find someone who hates it!\n\nWent to Kolachi on the third day of Eid, after a hiatus of about a year, and as expected the place was PACKED.  Atleast somewhere around 1000 individuals dining in, while roughly 500 just waiting to be seated -- and yet, everything went smooth.  The management wasn\u0027t freaking out, everything was under control, and more importantly the staff was courteous -- devoid of \u0027I\u0027m working on Eid, so deal with my attitude\u0027 sort of behavior.  The food was served within 20-25 minutes of ordering, despite the insane rush -- and all of the food was served at the right temperature.  \n\nOne doesn\u0027t have to remind the management there twice about an order, which is often the case with many other places.  At the end of the meal, someone from the management was courteous enough to ask about the experience, and any suggestions; and are actually happy if one provides any criticism for further improvement (unlike many others out here).\n\nWe ordered Peshawari Karhai, Hunzai Karhai, Katakat, and Makhni Handi.  The karhai was delicious, although it may not be the best in the city, but given the ambiance, the flavor was just fine.  The creamy and delicious Makhni Handi is probably the best in the city, closely followed by Tandoori Hut.  The Katakat was pretty bland and sad, but that didn\u0027t really matter a lot.  With 13 persons, the bill came up to roughly PKR650 per person, which is pretty reasonable given the service quality, flavor, and the ambiance.\n\nKolachi should start up a boot camp to train the plethora of restaurants out here who are not able to serve even 20 individuals at the same time (let alone 1000!), and have egos the size of Mount Everest to understand the simple needs of a customer.  \n\nDespite the volume, Kolachi is able to do a commendable job, and certainly deserves all the praise that is written about it time and again.  Without any random service charges, without any pretentious attitude, without any rats (and hair), and without humiliating the customer, Kolachi is able to do a bloody good job.  Highly recommended despite an average waiting time of 60 minutes.\n\nOverall Rating -- 9/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-12T22:56:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-13T18:34:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"692650033","name":"Shahbaz Khan"},{"id":"1627178378","name":"Zubair Aziz"},{"id":"706724744","name":"Sara Khalid-Asad"},{"id":"100001187356169","name":"Kanwal Durrani"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"659377501","name":"Somia Rizwan"},{"id":"1058959259","name":"Furqan Zafar Batla"},{"id":"534041252","name":"Faizan Yahya"},{"id":"100005715342653","name":"Sikandar Gaba"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"566412813","name":"Mehreen Farhat Adil"},{"id":"792915494","name":"Ahmad Fayyaz Ali"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"749604523","name":"Muhammad Umer Khan"},{"id":"504565020","name":"Shehzad Ghias Shaikh"},{"id":"100004312661028","name":"Lyla Byramji"},{"id":"552080867","name":"Tabassum Ali"},{"id":"100001653271774","name":"Vardah Zamir"},{"id":"720585459","name":"Aisha Abrar"},{"id":"630661421","name":"Mariam Ali"},{"id":"673798071","name":"Sarmad Tahir"},{"id":"715140026","name":"Saniya Surani"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"684790179","name":"Farooq Shaikh"},{"id":"668781078","name":"Asim Raza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY4NzgxMDc4","before":"NjkyNjUwMDMz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_602343696483451/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNjY4NzgxMDc4"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"602420949809059","from":{"name":"Muhammad Atif","id":"659193156"},"message":"Totally agreed for \u0027Karahi\u0027 point.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T02:55:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602454326472388","from":{"name":"Tauseef Haider","id":"1412656399"},"message":"Nicely described.
