My special request was not to ring the door bell and to call me instead once at the door. Delivery time was an hour. Close to midnight my phone rang and I was like oh that must be the delivery guy(and I was a little impressed as with all the eid madness, food is being delivered on time)... Wait no.. it was Shoaib from 14th street pizza, apologizing with me as my order \"HASN\u0027T BEEN PLACED\" due to some technical error of outlet being closed or something. WOW that took him an hour(the estimated delivery time) to realize that. He was being \"too generous\" to offer me \"10%\" discount if I still wanted to continue with my order. The delivery time was still the same. I was like no way... Even though he was apologizing continuously but that came across as being crass since once I said no thank you(which was more like f--- oops buzz off), he was extremely relieved, quickly said thank you and gone. Late delivery is one thing and somewhat looked over in eid madness. But that was totally unprofessional and 10% discount was infuriating, esp when offered in a way as if saying \"soch lain, discount de raha hon\"... He didn\u0027t say that(good for him) but to me it sounded like it...\n\nWhat followed after is another story.. but 14th street is off my list for now at least !!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-12T08:29:33+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-12T12:38:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100001531348244","name":"Mahwish Hussain"},{"id":"100000638405832","name":"Faria Khan"},{"id":"543845188","name":"Hafsa Azhar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzODQ1MTg4","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"602014316516389","from":{"name":"Hamzah Khan","id":"747525261"},"message":"Ordered it at 3 AM last night and was delivered to my door step by 3.55 AM.
