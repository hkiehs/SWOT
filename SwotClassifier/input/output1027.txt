Once again a fab experience worth writing home about :) Gave the Roast beef sandwich with wasabi mayo and Prawn burger a go last night.... couldn\u0027t decide which one was better! The Roast Beef was cooked to perfection, neither under nor over-cooked. The wasabi hit on the palate was euphoric, and the wasabi mayo salad accompanying the sanwich was a wow-factor. The Prawn Burger was tender n juicy, smelt and tasted terrific and came with a generous amount of fries! The best part about TUC is you leave feeling blissfully full but not sinfully heavy, perhaps because everything is portioned sensibly and mostly made in-house with the freshest and highest quality ingredients. Rounded off the evening with two scoops of Coffee \u0026 Hazlenut Gelato (the hot-selling Sicilian Pistachio had run-out). The Gelato\u0027s with their silky sheen were super-smooth and delicate. Wanted to try the cheesecakes, but were too full. Plan to pick one up on saturday for a dinner..... would be great if Hav Joe recommends his personal favorite! Another great feature of TUC is that even though the place is brimming with customers, it\u0027s not noisy. On the contrary, it has a great cozy feel, which should be attributed to Hamid\u0027s warm and welcoming persona. Thanks for a great dining experience. We eagerly await the launch of the Chelo\u0027s :)","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-01T11:25:26+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-01T11:25:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"1249052648","name":"Shirin Ali Khan"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4","before":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_269536236430867","from":{"name":"Murtaza Salim","id":"580750864"},"message":"Can any1 provide me the number of Captain.Saleem a.k.a the crabbing guy @ keamari.Thx!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-01T09:11:19+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-01T09:38:55+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"269538253097332","from":{"name":"Danial Rizvi","id":"726690443"},"message":"Actually, everyone there is \"Capt Saleem\" or either \"Capt Asif\"","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-01T09:22:21+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"269541783096979","from":{"name":"Najia Omer","id":"100001697733780"},"message":"0300-228-2231","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-01T09:38:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjY5NTQxNzgzMDk2OTc5","before":"MjY5NTM4MjUzMDk3MzMy"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_269207756463715","from":{"name":"Shafia Agha","id":"650845003"},"message":"Went to TUC and had the raspberry froyo.
