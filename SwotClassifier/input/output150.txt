Judging from the sad decline of Pizza Hut over the past years (especially past year) I hope they don\u0027t do the same with BK.

The whopper looked very unimpressive, it was cold, patty was super thin and dry and tasteless even the KFC frozen patty is better, total disappointment. I don\u0027t know what all this hype is about, the whopper is a disappointment, the chicken burger is like a sub, patty is decent and well flavored, was served hot and much better than beef.

To begin with; as soon as we entered and were deciding amongst ourselves whether to sit on the couches or chair, he rudely remarked on us to stop creating a fuss and ordered us to take the table with the chairs.\n\nWhile we were having our dessert, we could see constant footfall and not enough tables to accommodate all. So he was constantly hovering on our heads in anticipation of us emptying the table the moment we finished our plates. As soon as we were finished; we got our check immediately, and while we were engaged in our own conversation after a nice dessert, we were very rudely interrupted, were asked to pay the bill and leave, as there were other customers waiting. \n\nI agree, that other customers could be waiting outside, but to actually interrupt a group enjoying their time, and ask them to leave the cafe was quite an appalling behavior. Moreover, when we politely told him that we found this rude, he argued back and said he had every right to tell us to leave if he wanted to! Quite shocking.\n\nTeam DelFrio, you really need to re-train your staff to behave themselves as this might just be taking your customers away. \n(I actually started wondering if he had some personal vendetta against us!) :p","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-07T20:03:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-08T08:53:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"508711331","name":"Ali Naeem"},{"id":"667185780","name":"Tahir Karimi"},{"id":"100005736485212","name":"AK Pasha"},{"id":"807274869","name":"Saman Khokhar"},{"id":"100001651622767","name":"Fatima Tariq"},{"id":"515575349","name":"Zain Ul Abideen Ferozpuri"},{"id":"516120343","name":"Kiran Majid"},{"id":"746376004","name":"Sameen Shahid"},{"id":"1520683800","name":"Areeba Zaheer"},{"id":"649049339","name":"Basit Saeed"},{"id":"549415486","name":"Yasir Ahmad"},{"id":"100001187356169","name":"Kanwal Durrani"},{"id":"1256236750","name":"Muhammad Saad Khan"},{"id":"726085463","name":"Zohaib Hasan"},{"id":"827180267","name":"DrJoyo Tabsheer"},{"id":"599660473","name":"Syed Umer Bin Saghir"},{"id":"687580830","name":"Shoaib Taimur"},{"id":"603335552","name":"Hamza Quadri"},{"id":"524907596","name":"Syed Zohaib"},{"id":"669320704","name":"Fahad Azad"},{"id":"1519835339","name":"Fiza Shabir"},{"id":"753624574","name":"Shazmeen Raza"},{"id":"100003495204029","name":"Noman Faysal"},{"id":"100000679437817","name":"Yasir Hameed"},{"id":"665335520","name":"M.Umair Usman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY1MzM1NTIw","before":"NTA4NzExMzMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"630119787039175","from":{"name":"Salman H.
