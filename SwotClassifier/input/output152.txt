It was home to a culinary delight of mythical proportions, called The Whopper. As time passed and consumerism ruled, places similar to Burger King started their slow but deliberate invasion of our fine country. However, as they came one after another, Burger King remained elusive. And as with all things elusive, they more it played hard to get, the more we craved it. When we travelled abroad, we would have BK at every available opportunity - in some cases, people even went to extreme lengths like buying it from the DXB airport (where it was conveniently located near gate 210, where the morning Karachi flight invariably was) so that it could be brought back and enjoyed with the family. \n\nAnd then one day, there was an ad in a newspaper, advertising jobs at… gasp… Burger King Pakistan! It has been a journey of epic anticipation, waiting (thankfully not with baited breath) until today, when I lined up with many others in the glaring sun outside BK Nishat to have my ever favourite - the Double Whopper. The queue moved relatively fast and in about 30 minutes, I was in. Another 20 minutes and I was at the counter, where I found out, to my utter dismay, that there is no Double Whopper. A minor misstep, I thought, and promptly ordered three Whopper meals and two Chicken Royale meals. There was some confusion about whether fries are being served to customers or not, as there was a shortage and perhaps fries were only being provided to customers who had placed their orders well before mine. But that was quickly sorted and I was assured that five lovely packets of fries would accompany the burgers. There was a wait of 15-20 minutes for the food to be served, although it felt like eternity. And then, suddenly, there it was: a Whopper, in front of me, in Pakistan. Fast forward twenty minutes and there you have wrappers on the trays, empty Pepsi glasses and fry packets. The fries, by the way, are absolutely mind-glowingly good. Its hard to believe they\u0027re from a fast food outlet. The burgers… are a slightly different, more complicated story. They were good, but as we left, I couldn\u0027t help but think that the whole experience was somewhat underwhelming. So I really thought about it - yes, it wasn\u0027t a Double Whopper which is what I always have, but that wasn\u0027t it. And its not as though the burgers were bad: they\u0027re just like BK everywhere else. The size is good, its a nice filling meal without making you feel stuffed. Even the Pepsi was really good :) But the problem is this: when I first visited Burger Shack, I couldn\u0027t wait to go back. And sadly, I don\u0027t feel the same way about BK. In fact, I\u0027m not really feeling the need to go back. And I think the reason is this: we\u0027ve been spoiled by offerings like Burger Shack. The advent of the gourmet burger into our lives means that as good as the Whopper is, its just not good enough. I know I\u0027m not alone in comparing Burger King to Burger Shack - at least four people in BK were doing the same thing. \n\nIn conclusion: Burger King is, or rather, the Whopper, Angus and Chicken Royale are just like their foreign counterparts. I\u0027m sure that the others, including the Swiss and Mushroom will be just as good, whenever they are launched. The onion rings too, when they become available, should be good. They\u0027re having a lot of management related issues right now and the staff is clearly under-trained, but that will be fixed over time. You can go to BK and know that you\u0027ll get the same taste you get everywhere else - just don\u0027t go expecting BK to blow the local offerings out of the water. Because, as I\u0027m unbelievably proud to say, the local offerings are better. Which reminds me, I haven\u0027t had Burger Shack in a while...","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-06T12:20:33+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-07T12:06:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"569196654","name":"Maria Sultan"},{"id":"786471893","name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed"},{"id":"648091964","name":"Saba Sadia"},{"id":"732705760","name":"Nishat Aleem Khan"},{"id":"752174107","name":"Urooj Imran"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1371113498","name":"Danyal Sopariwala"},{"id":"571881277","name":"Sna Nm"},{"id":"565157664","name":"Sarah Farooq"},{"id":"100000223684855","name":"Sana A.

I checked out the menu on Karachi Snob (as well as seeing this post) and the menu looked amazing. But then I was scared about the servings being small so opted for Roaster\u0027s on Zamzama for steak. First time I ever visited Roaster\u0027s. I heard so much about it but both my wife and me were a bit disappointed on the steak. Dry and no zest at all (she had the BBQ steak, I had the Tarragon), and way overpriced for that kind of quality. Arizona Grill steaks much better quality and better price. In the end Allah ka Shukar for the lovely night out and having a nice meal but won\u0027t ever think Roaster\u0027s again for steak (I heard their burgers better).  But I was sad that we opted out of Forty-4 last minute (its a 5-min walk from our home too and we believe in giving first patronage to people in the neighborhood :) The food looks very nice and immaculately crafted. I promise to make this up and give Forty-4 a try soon. We went to Cafe Aylanto few months ago and I think theirs was the best steak I ever had for the money.
