How many did he eat, and where did he put them?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-10T21:14:07+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-11T19:24:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"567525860","name":"Saima Jamil Ashraf"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"603100292","name":"Abbas Bootwala"},{"id":"578840177","name":"Danish Raza"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEyMDkxMjYx","before":"NTIxNzAyNjY0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"395888933795596","from":{"name":"Mariam Salman","id":"633700975"},"message":"i think it was my coz bilal alavi;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T21:19:17+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"395889607128862","from":{"name":"Saira Faruqi","id":"521702664"},"message":"Mariam Salman - I want to shake his hand if he won :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T21:21:10+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"633700975","name":"Mariam Salman","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"396076300443526","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"Saira Faruqi that was a pleasant, lost, and unannounced spur of the moment arrival thank you so much for your visit, not one there were 2 who ate 5 each ordered the sixth and then decided to share the title, the BIIIIIIG LOGGGGGERS were, Bilal Alvi and Mustapha Jamal.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-11T06:02:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":12},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi","type":"user","offset":238,"length":10},{"id":"567785491","name":"Mustapha Jamal","type":"user","offset":253,"length":14}]},{"id":"396077030443453","from":{"name":"Saira Faruqi","id":"521702664"},"message":"5.5 of the Big Log\u0027s?

I had the pleasure of tasting them \u0026 what a delightful experience! Absolutely loved the crusty top. Taha has improved his recipe and made it more chocolatey, chewer, denser \u0026 flatter and I could easily appreciate all these aspects! Top-class quality at unbeatable prices! The fantastic bit for me was that the brownie was extremely light to eat. Generally I find brownies heavy in texture and have to eat them with ice-cream etc. and find it difficult to eat a big serving. But Taha\u0027s brownies were so very good that they didn\u0027t need anything to go with it and disappeared in a jiffy, left me craving and wanting more! Who could resist devouring and polishing such excellent brownies? Also, I feel the need to warm brownies in the microwave for a bit before eating them but I had Tahas brownies directly from the fridge and found them fresh \u0026 perfect. Another great aspect is that his brownie is not overwhelmingly sweet. Often, bakers make their desserts a tad bit too sweet which masks the actual flavours. However, a good baker like Taha doesnt need to depend on extra sugar to achieve the taste. When you have Tahas brownies u realise that u really are eating genuine brownies and not some unauthentic baked product passed off as a brownie. His brownies are certainly melt in your mouth as described by him  fantastically yummylicious and scrumtious. All the hard work, special care and love that Taha puts in his baking is clearly evident when you try his products. His customer service is brilliant! Despite being the newest, youngest, least experienced and the most reasonable baker in town, his goodies stand tall with any other baker. Taha uses imported ingredients but keeps a bare profit margin which is y his prices r so fab!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T07:50:23+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393422657375557","from":{"name":"Ratan Salem","id":"681799779"},"message":"Saira Faruqi do you make Mohinga as well ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T09:18:59+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":12}]},{"id":"393591194025370","from":{"name":"Abbas Bootwala","id":"603100292"},"message":"what i want is good tasty flavourfull lattoo!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T15:30:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393690420682114","from":{"name":"Tasneem Murtazaalibhai","id":"676000707"},"message":"meri brownie  kab hoi  gih  please  let me know  am craving it so much ill be mean   to my  husband please put lots of walnuts :()","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T19:07:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393719904012499","from":{"name":"Saira Faruqi","id":"521702664"},"message":"Ratan Salem - only made it twice.
