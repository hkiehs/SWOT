I ignored all this as I can understand that they were fasting and these kind of things do happen mean while they both stopped and my food was ready I took it and went to home. When we started to eat during Iftar time I must tell you that some chicken pieces were really under cooked of the rice n spice and were not in a condition to chew, as we are peace lovers :p so we just ate the rice and some cooked chicken pieces and threw rest of them in the bin. I did go after Iftar and conveyed my message to the supervisor he told me calmly \"sir if you could bring those boxes I can give you another one\" I said I don\u0027t want them I just wanted to bring this thing into your knowledge.\n\nI guess that loud argument made other chefs under pressure or their concentration got diverted as a result the consumer suffered so my message to the managers/supervisors is that you should always handle the situation calmly that\u0027s why you are a manager you have to manage things within the limited resources.
