Had been craving their Irish Nut Creme coffee since it opened here and happy to report that it was as awesome as I remembered it. Perfectly creamy and balanced with no need to add any sugar. Yum! Had the tiramisu with it but well, I\u0027ve had better tiramisu so that was a disappointment. The Irish creme tho makes up for the so-so dessert and is hiiighly recommended.
