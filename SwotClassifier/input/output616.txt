We went to try Burger Shack last night at 9 ish with my younger sisters.. I was a bit taken back by the self service idea idea n being made to stand on the roadside n wait while all the cars passing by us n creepy people stare at us..( i m very protective abt my sisters n probably thats i was loathing this idea even more ;/)               i didnt understand the logic of wasting so much space inside the shop when they could easily accomodate us inside. \n                                                                                                                             Living in Karachi has us spoiled us i guess and if we eat at a road side joint we are used to of being brought a menu by a waiter, who takes our order n we eat in peace............ON top of that we were told that Burger Shack was out of beef ???Hello!! ?? People were standing are screaming at the cashiers at the confusion abt their orders...one of the guys stepped forward and asked them what was the weight of the patty n the cashier told him he didnt know...:0!!!\n\n We were there n very  hungry so we still ordered Chicken Crunch,Chicken Jalepeno crunch and Honey Mustard crunch combos n asked our driver to stand near the window to collect our order. The order arrived and we left,but on our way home we realised the pack had NO fries, NO sauces,NO napkins Nor drinks.??? \u003d0!!! We went back all the way to collect it. The burgers were not bad but i dont understand their careless attitude n customer service. The idea of self service is alright but there were no guards around nor any proper space to wait..\n\nProbably will try more from them, once they start home delivery. Good food but pathetic service!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-17T04:15:46+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-17T20:47:12+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"506652342719254","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Hence have not tried them yet.
