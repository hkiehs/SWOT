As u might have read and observed, a few individuals r quite upset about their dining experience since feb/march. What our patrons actually experienced at that time was a 8 course meal when we first opened at rs1800 per head with 5 entrees at least. That on its own is great value. They were  never forced, alternate and cheaper set menus were always available. Subsequently, when the ala carte came through, we made sure to check our prices again due to customer complaints - but none of the dishes prices  were changed on an individual basis and we have manage to get an avg per head at rs1200. Duck is extra - its a premium imported meat in karachi. I acknowledge there was a one off bad experience when China kitchen was surprise swotted but that should not have individuals poking at the restaurant and it\u0027s potential customers on every positive post that comes through. Thats just sad and its like a kick in the stomach every time. I am glad that you have enjoyed your meal again and I hope that China Kitchen will continue to keep it\u0027s standards up to your mark.

Most people are having great experiences there now and happily reporting about it. I still haven\u0027t given CK another shot, perhaps because I sensed a lack of interest on the part of owners/ management in acknowledging that they goofed up that day and couldn\u0027t care less.. and this wasn\u0027t just through notes on SWOT.. This was a first-hand experience. Anyways, the point of this post is that you just need a few words and goodwill gestures to nullify a customer\u0027s bad experience.
