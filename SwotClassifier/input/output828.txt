Had been wanting to try it out for the longest time and was in the mood to eat Chinese so called them up at 8 to see if any tables were free and if they could be reserved. Was told that there would be a table free at 10:30, asked if anything was there earlier he said i can come at 10:15 and confirmed that my reservation is done and he wrote down my name and number. Reached at 10:15 and the place was packed with lots of people waiting and it just kept getting worse, the fellow at the counter said my name and number wasn\u0027t written down and they take reservations till 7 and the guy on the phone must have said it just like that. Seriously? Then he said we should wait for 15 minutes and we\u0027ll get a table, there was a problem with someone else s reservation too, where they wrote the wrong name by mistake. Anyways kept waiting, 30 minutes passed and the guy at the counter just kept delaying the time and disappeared and sent someone else to handle the people and that person was equally confused. Decided to leave and go to Olivetto where the service was PERFECT and so was the food, had the pepper steak and shikanjabeen and the bread basket was amazing as always!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-06T06:33:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-13T03:40:29+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"513644734","name":"Danish Bhimani"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"530485619","name":"Hana Faisal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTMwNDg1NjE5","before":"NTEzNjQ0NzM0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"409584935759329","from":{"name":"Umme Hamdani","id":"592813967"},"message":"I think ginsoy should just let go of reservations.
