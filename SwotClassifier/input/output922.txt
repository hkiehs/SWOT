The place was full with people waiting like they will be getting the meal for free.  Cleanliness in the dining area is a major issue, the management just isn\u0027t bothered and can\u0027t handle the rush.  The ice vending machine was out of order and there was a person standing at the drinks counter with a bucket of ice.  All soft drinks were flat and at room temperature.  The fries both French and Curly were served absolutely cold and are a waste coz the same cant be consumed.  The burgers were nothing great to write home about, we ordered the mushroom \u0026 Swiss thick burger, grilled chicken, jalapeño and buffalo along with side orders of chilli lava fries and chicken tenders.  There was an excessive use of sauces and mayo in the burgers that the patty kept slipping out of the buns.  The buns were, however, very fresh and soft.   The only item worth mentioning are the chicken tenders which were served fresh with a sauce which had an amazing flavour.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T19:10:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-07T13:17:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"555701439","name":"Raamish Zaidi Irani"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"669795452","name":"Haseeb Akhtar"},{"id":"726690443","name":"Danial Rizvi"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"561399662","name":"M Azwerul Haque"},{"id":"620275602","name":"Maria Jaffar"},{"id":"510835801","name":"Nudrrat Khawaja"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"},{"id":"100003784320529","name":"Shahzad Saeed"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"100000391823197","name":"Farah S.

The Cashew nut chicken lacked the richness of flavor which I had been craving. Over all I will give it an 8/10. Now to the most disgusting part.

The khowsuey, although quite different from the regular sort, was absolutely scrumptious! Tangy and spicy. Probably just needed some more papri for the crunch factor.. And since it was stir-fried, i didn\u0027t expect it to be overly creamy. The khowsuey was accompanied by two separately packed sauces: one was chilli oil, and the other was a yellow coloured sauce/ gravy, which I thought would be coconut curry, but wasn\u0027t and in fact was too bland to decipher what it could be. Other than a tablespoon or so of oil floating at the base of the box (only visible when I was finishing the khowsuey), the meal was wholesome and fantastic.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-07T05:39:22+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-07T05:46:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"374387502612406","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"i LOVEEEE deli\u0027s stir fry!!! its yum!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-07T05:46:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzc0Mzg3NTAyNjEyNDA2","before":"Mzc0Mzg3NTAyNjEyNDA2"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_374155935968896","from":{"name":"Sarah Ashraf","id":"643405172"},"message":"Espresso, love it on any other day but today.
