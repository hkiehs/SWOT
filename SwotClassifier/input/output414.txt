Here we go:\n\nThe Good:\n-Nice looking place, very nicely done interior and exterior.\n-Quiet location, bad day for traffic.\n-Courteous staff. Tried their level best to deliver good service during the peak hour.\n-Nice touch with the green tea.\n-Really liked the peanut sauce with the nicely done chicken satay. Good stuff.\n\nThe Bad:\n-One of the LOUDEST places I\u0027ve been to. These places are supposed to be quiet and relaxing. Not the restaurant\u0027s fault if the crowd is loud? It all starts when you have to speak over something. usually loud music.\n-The waiter either didn\u0027t know the serving size or lied about tit so that we order the bigger serving. Starter serving size turned out to be wrong. First said 8, We opted for the smaller size. Then 4, we switched to the larger size. Turned out to be 6. Also, smart tactic...suggested we order 1 big and 1 small serving of rice, knowing it wouldn\u0027t be enough for us so that we order an additional smaller one. Mo\u0027 Money, yo.\n-Table prep and utensil presentation was careless and poor\n-The grilled hot/spicy beef thing was grilled wayyyyy too much (photo attached). A bit beyond charred. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s supposed to look and taste burnt. Called back the waiter, took and showed to someone. They said it\u0027s supposed to be like that but...could have tasted good if it were not like that. BAD choice. Don\u0027t recommend. \n-The red curry chicken was wayyyyy too salty. Burning salty. Sadness.\n-The crispy prawns with lemon sauce was...a dish full of tiny 1/2 inch fried prawns, covered in an OK batter, rolling around on the plate, dry, with some lemon and butter sauce in a little sauce bowl thing. for over Rs. 700. Beyond disappointing. Total rip-off. Never ever order it.\n-The waiter got the drink order wrong. No biggie.\n-Kung Pao chicken was a random bowl of chicken and vegetables but not bad. Nothing special, bad presentation.\n-Got some left-overs packed. They magically reduced to half their original quantity when we got home.\n-Food was served like 40-45 minutes after the order. Not a large order.\n\nPlace: 8/10\nAmbience: 4.5/10 for being TOO loud and haphazard\nFood: 6/10\nValue for money: 6.5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-08T12:02:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-09T09:07:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002332607255","name":"Hira Zahoor"},{"id":"503984035","name":"Ayesha Shaukat"},{"id":"652385634","name":"Fahad Asadullah"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"505055634","name":"Umme Ifrah Arif"},{"id":"581947488","name":"Nida Fahd"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTgxOTQ3NDg4","before":"MTAwMDAyMzMyNjA3MjU1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"582163635168124","from":{"name":"Abdul Shakoor Motiwala","id":"590540852"},"message":"totally agree i did not like there food end of story","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-08T12:46:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"582183865166101","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"They feel grilled and burnt are synonymous.
