The Pita sandwich with it\u0027s crispy pita and melt in your mouth cheese, is highly recommended if you like your cheese, but if you\u0027re up for the more subtle flavors of a slightly toasted shawarma with a brush of garlic sauce and hint of chilli, i suggest you try the basic chicken shawarma, it is yum! The piece de resistance for me, however, has always been the shawarma platter.
