Simply for the reason we can not give in to the depression and the suppression of the powers that are trying to destroy us. \n\nThe positive side on the food front started with the red carpet opening of the much awaited the fine dining seafood restaurant HOOK LINE \u0026 SINKER. \n\nThe force behind this venture are the two dynamic gentlemen, one of whom I know well and when he wants something he will go and get it and he had once promised us a place that will be different in every way possible from what has been seen in Karachi.\n\nWell I have to admit he did it. \n\nToday was our first proper meal at HLS. Booked a table for 4 wanted to keep it simple and easy and NOT scare them to jitters. Initially had asked for the dining room, but seeing that the weather is again crispy and chilly we asked to be seated on the gorgeous deck. So far the ambiance that has been created at HLS beats the rest by a mile. It\u0027s simple elegant in pretensions and extremely welcoming.\n\nOrdered the few things we had sampled and because those were brilliant then - we couldn\u0027t wait to eat them properly.\n\n1) English style fish and chips - yum. Reminded me of the little kiosk at Victoria Station in London, where I had first had them as a kid and fell in love.....what was missing - the newspaper in which those had been served. Oh yeah the salt and vinegar for the chips. But for a fine dining place these were just the right thing to eat out in the deck.\n2) grilled red snapper peperonata - just perfect. The texture, the sauce and the seasoning. Takes one back to the rustic beaches off Sicily \n3) fried fish from the house of Khatian - except of the many many many bones in this fish......it has to be one the most amazing menu items anyone has introduced to fine dining. \n4) we did have a non seafood eater with us who ordered a very elaborate looking Caesar salad. Which she claimed was extremely good.\n\nThe desserts which we had not sampled in the previous sessions just blew us away. \n\nThe kiwi mousse was such a delight I know I will be ordering that each time I visiting HLS. the coffee mousse was just the correct texture and bitterness with a balance of sweetness. \n\nThe cheese cake has to be the best one in town simple and just perfect. \n\nLooking forward many many more eating sessions at HLS.\n\nDisclaimer: this was the first time we got to see the menu properly - it is not obviously BOTS, but it\u0027s not like the way some people have thought it would be. It\u0027s fine dining at its best in Karachi and for that it was very decently priced.\n\nFor further info check out their Facebook page and make your reservations.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/hlspakistan","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-13T19:47:55+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-17T10:17:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"728371533","name":"Ismaa Khan"},{"id":"541815815","name":"Farah Qureshi"},{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"505751528","name":"Fatima Saleem"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"767165491","name":"Zara Tareen"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1567472798","name":"Jehanzeb Sa"},{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"517511348","name":"Mian Taimur Arbab"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"731410527","name":"Aziz Noorani"},{"id":"100000059823691","name":"Haroon Leghari"},{"id":"100003672338905","name":"Umbreen Mahmood"},{"id":"706695454","name":"Zarmina Kadir"},{"id":"504520279","name":"Aamir Butt"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA0NTIwMjc5","before":"MTAwMDAxODU4NDUwMDEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"487191134665375","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"**unpretentious**","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-13T19:49:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"487191654665323","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Credit for the desserts....
