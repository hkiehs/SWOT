Since it was a buffet, let me go over the items one by one:\n\n1. The spicy pasta salad - 10/10 Full of flavor and zest. \n2. Chicken Biryani - 10/10 Again, scrumptious with the just the perfect amount of oil and spice. Just the way I like it.\n3. White Qorma - 5/10 Nothing to write home about. It was \"Shan-masala\" made.\n4. Daal - Didn\u0027t try\n5. Mix Sabzi - 10/10 Brilliant.\n6. Chicken Khara Masala - 5/10 Bland.\n7.Creamy Pasta - 3/10 Kept this for the last. Couldn\u0027t eat more than one bite. Too much methi or something, wasn\u0027t creamy or cheesy. Totally tasteless.\n8. Fried fish - 10/10 Delish!\n9. The soup - I don\u0027t know what soup it was but it wasn\u0027t good.\n\nFor Desserts:\n\n1. The caramel biscuit was my winner tonight. Soft and crumbly with a yummy biscuit base, it was just divine.\n2. Great caramel pudding....but then haven\u0027t seen ANYONE messing that up :)\n3. Chocolate pastry was nice. But a little dry.\n4. Mom loved the shahi tukra, the rasberry shortcake and the trifle.\n5. The blueberry cheesecake was awesome.\n6. Chocolate soufflé\u0027 - nice and airy\n\nOverall, a great time at the place but having said that, it didn\u0027t match up to the high KFC gave me yesterday :D LOL!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-27T19:52:39+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-27T20:14:13+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"643405172","name":"Sarah Ashraf"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI1OTY4OTUz","before":"MTAwMDAyMzc0OTE3MDM5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"387319667985856","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"yes the fish is delicious!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-27T20:14:13+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzg3MzE5NjY3OTg1ODU2","before":"Mzg3MzE5NjY3OTg1ODU2"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_387228841328272","from":{"name":"Ayesha Oosman","id":"783794861"},"message":"Upper Crust gelato remains the best!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-27T17:25:54+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-27T20:08:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002754122866","name":"Sania Tabani Maskatiya"},{"id":"643405172","name":"Sarah Ashraf"},{"id":"597535350","name":"De Joe"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTk3NTM1MzUw","before":"MTAwMDAyNzU0MTIyODY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"387266411324515","from":{"name":"Afroza Bhamani","id":"846664538"},"message":"I totally agree!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-27T18:36:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"387316177986205","from":{"name":"Aamina Jahangir","id":"501859943"},"message":"Amen!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-27T20:08:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzg3MzE2MTc3OTg2MjA1","before":"Mzg3MjY2NDExMzI0NTE1"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_386720981379058","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"What a lovely evening at Olivetto.

We were served the refreshing Log Inn special drink in miniatures glasses which was very refreshing. For starters we had Chicken strips which were delicious and crispy accompanied with dip, these were served complimentary as Najmul Quddusi was kind enough to extend the urbanite complimentary starters offer for four of us, in dine also.  As discussed with him, urbanite is a fine addition for restaurants who did not have a delivery system of their own, earlier and whose customers would like to order in deliveries. For the main course I had fried Fish as recommended, was apprehensive initially, when the dish was placed before me and I had my first morsel all the fears vanished, it was perfectly fresh, tender, juicy and great taste served with tarter sauce and lemon. Had the Log Inn Beef Cheese Burger, Crispy Chicken Burger, Penne Pasta and Fettuccine paste for the kids. Everything was fresh and served hot, burgers tasted great and fries were crisp.\nThank you Najam sahib was the warm hospitality extended me and my family.       Your keen interest and personal effort to maintain the quality and flavor at Log Inn is indeed a value addition and the secret of success for your restaurant.
