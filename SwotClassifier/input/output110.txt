How thin, how thick \u0026 what shape to cut the food will produce a different effect on eating,the Beef Chilli,prawn tempura and the fried prawn balls main characteristic was their weak,thread-like shape.Both the prawn dishes were heavily coated in layers upon layers of batter and literally the taste,and the prawn content, of each was,non- distinguishable.we were hoping for a Deep-fried, crisp, fluffy batter surrounding juicy, perfectly cooked prawns.The deep fried prawns tempura, and the fried prawn balls were most similar.\n Stir-fried meats are often seared prior to stir-frying, creating sauces and dishes that exude comfort and this is exactly something I couldnt find tonight. Their signature Popular dishes from be it in beef or chicken swimming in spicy sauces , or their hot crispy fish or their fun and fresh sushi ordered in the lazy,mindless TV hogging state failed to create a meal for us and dissapointing the consummate Chairman mao fan.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-11-01T23:39:33+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-01T23:39:33+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100003698171140","name":"Asra Mushtaq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAzNjk4MTcxMTQw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"picture":"http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/602122_316466355162407_2129422081_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d316466355162407\u0026set\u003dpcb.643599412357879\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d3","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_642826965768457","from":{"name":"Urbanite Pk","id":"100003613396124"},"message":"Only Treats, No Tricks!\n\nOrder Burger Inc. via http://urbanite.pk/vendor-profile/vendorprofile/2524-Burger+Inc.html\n\nand have a festive rest of the night!\n\nHappy Halloween!!!","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-10-31T14:15:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-01T21:11:30+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001172477386","name":"Haaniya Saad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMTcyNDc3Mzg2","before":"MTAwMDAxMTcyNDc3Mzg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"642837949100692","from":{"name":"Danish Jabir Janoo","id":"622960888"},"message":"No","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-31T14:38:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"643502085700945","from":{"name":"Ahsan Nasir","id":"566313979"},"message":"kia bana burger inc ka khali para tha ...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-01T21:11:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQzNTAyMDg1NzAwOTQ1","before":"NjQyODM3OTQ5MTAwNjky"}}},"picture":"http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/1394350_385234161607027_1661635923_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d385234161607027\u0026set\u003dgm.642826965768457\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_643238552393965","from":{"name":"Nabeel Khan","id":"534190471"},"message":"Guess sometimes All-You-Can-Eat can be for the underprivileged too :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-01T10:03:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-01T20:18:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"907360281","name":"Sarah Leghari"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"1579977743","name":"Amena Zoeb"},{"id":"100000579313166","name":"Xobi Shah"},{"id":"749604523","name":"Muhammad Umer Khan"},{"id":"540048737","name":"Furqan Hanif"},{"id":"574936476","name":"Tahira Abbas"},{"id":"588501861","name":"Tanveer Farooq"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"629848557","name":"Farisa Afzal"},{"id":"726707145","name":"Nadia Rehan"},{"id":"504457451","name":"Shehna Mansoor Sheikh"},{"id":"100000161501936","name":"Anny Khurram"},{"id":"100001947940888","name":"Ana Khan"},{"id":"648503715","name":"Ahsan Mansoor Khan"},{"id":"559930949","name":"Faiza Tahir"},{"id":"599163578","name":"Hammad Ahmad Khan"},{"id":"553520531","name":"Saman Athar"},{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"548806223","name":"Sheikh Arsalan Saeed"},{"id":"189100160","name":"Ehtesham Maqbool"},{"id":"100002054881531","name":"Aamir Khan"},{"id":"48921867","name":"Anum Shahid-Ahmed"},{"id":"100001165528409","name":"Aisha Talha Farooqui"},{"id":"808780646","name":"Jahangeer Ali Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODA4NzgwNjQ2","before":"OTA3MzYwMjgx"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_643238552393965/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dODA4NzgwNjQ2"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"643475492370271","from":{"name":"Maheen Siddiqui","id":"1198610816"},"message":"Who provides this service ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-01T20:07:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"643477682370052","from":{"name":"Nabeel Khan","id":"534190471"},"message":"Parveen who runs KhanaGhar (http://www.khanaghar.org/)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-01T20:09:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"643480795703074","from":{"name":"Maheen Siddiqui","id":"1198610816"},"message":"Ok thank you","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-01T20:12:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"643480805703073","from":{"name":"Nadah Khan","id":"508456356"},"message":"whats the procedure of being a part of khana ghar ?
