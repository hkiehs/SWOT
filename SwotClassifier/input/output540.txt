Never again!! Admittedly, it was a lot of food for Rs 2000.. One huge pizza (20\" ??) 6 chicken wings, pepperoni sticks, 1.5 litre coke and 10 sauces (we got only 6 though). We order the pizza half-and-half: Godspell Beef Load (salami, pepperoni, seasoned ground beef, mushrooms, black olives, green peppers and roasted onions) and Wicked Blend (Chicken Tikka, Chicken Fajita, Smoky Chicken, Roasted onions and flooring of Green peppers, mushrooms and olives). The pizza was so oily that I wish I had eaten Nihari instead! There was something off about the meat toppings.. the salami was absolutely unchewable, the chicken toppings all seemed to be of one type only unlike the description. The cheese was lacking in taste and in quality. Marinara sauce was almost non-existent, and was also one of the sauces missing from our deal. The pepperoni sticks were a square pizza slice cut into strips with pieces of pepperoni strewn here and there on the cheese topped crust. The only saving grace were the wings which tasted great but were literally minuscule. Given the kind of advertising they are doing, I was expecting to be blown away! But sadly, it turned out to be my worst pizza experience to date!
