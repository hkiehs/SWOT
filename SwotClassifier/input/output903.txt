Its naturally churned and hence no crystallisation, the flavour was quite good but not natural, for a 4oz cup it\u0027s 130/- without toppings (that is charged according to the topping) and the 7 oz cup for 220/-. It melts to a liquids form indicating it is indeed low in fat. Also that it has a powdered mixed into water to enhance the flavour. The 26th street shop has more options in toppings than the initial Park Towers shop. As for point #9 yes for me.\n\n2) TUTTI FRUTTI\nNo the yogurt flavour was not obvious in any flavour other than the natural one. This was all purely artificial flavouring, the pricing is exactly the weight of the cup inclusive of the topping weight - and it\u0027s insanely reasonable. It melts down to pure liquid form - a powder mixed with water 100%. The flavours last till the end. Amazing variety of toppings and yes this is a fun alternate to all desserts (non-frozen included) since the make-your-own is too cute for words.\n\n3) SNOG\nFirst of all my first time in the shop and tasting...amazing place. The taste is ALL YOGURT, it was all natural no crystallisation, creamy till the end, with great flavor options and interesting toppings. Its alson the most expensive one in the market smallest cup starti at 340/- for 140gms. Toppings are of course extra. It melts to a foamy liquid - which clearly indicates a natural cultured yogurt. This is for the serious  FROYO lovers with a mature palate and not an alternate to other desserts. I see myself eating this more often than not. WELCOME TO KARACHI.\n\n4) UPPER CRUST\ncall me biased but this remains my ultimate place for frozen dessert heaven. The flavor and texture of this FroYo is evident in every flavor except the Belgian Chocolate. Yes the artificial sweetening can be detected as a slight bitter aftertaste in other flavours too. The dark rich Belgian chocolate covers that. But it\u0027s obvious in the fruity ones. It melts very slowly and becomes a heavy liquidy milkshake in the cup, so am thinking its not fat free, but I have seen this being made so I know the cultured yogurt used is free from all artificial additives. It\u0027s about 160/- for a small cup - for about 100-120 gms.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-17T07:32:56+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-17T22:35:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"523286481","name":"Adnan J.

Definitely a proper SWOT session with papers and everything. As you have all been reading about the froyo session I thought I\u0027d get my two bits in as well. By the end I was a walking talking froyo machine, a frominator if you will. \n\nBerrylicious:- They have opened a cute little outfit on 26th street. They have now introduced coffee and some other non-froyo items there too, beside froyo, which is interesting but I think they\u0027ll have a tough time pulling crowd to their joint. The only incentive for me going there now would be their coconut flavored froyo. Personally I am not very pushed about going to Berrylicious anymore, though it is a little sad as they were the pioneers in introducing froyo to Karachiites. \n\nTutti Frutti:- Definitely the game changer in the froyo market of Karachi. They have completely changed the dynamics of froyo market. Going to TF is always a fun filled experience. At any given point they have 8 flavors with a lot of toppings. The entire experience of making your own froyo is quite novel as well and if you factor in the price, being the cheapest,  TF has quite a bright future ahead of it. They have brought froyo from a niche market to the masses. I\u0027d be frequenting them quite often. Lychee, TF tart, pomegranate and blueberry are excellent flavors and must be tried.  \n\nSNOG:- Haute Couture froyo. If one were to categorize froyos into automobiles, SNOG would be the Rolls Royce of froyos. It is certainly the most expensive of the lot and every penny is worth it. They are targeting to the consumer with with a complex taste palate, one who does wants to taste the most natural and creamiest froyo. It may not appeal to the masses but then again SNOG at the end of the day, is all about quality and not quality. The toppings available are quite exotic as well. None of the other places can match the luxury toppings offered at SNOG. Natural and passion fruit flavors are sure shot winners. \n\nThe Upper Crust:- Personally I have never been a huge fan of froyo at TUC. One primary reason being the limitations of froyo flavors and toppings at TUC. Having said that no other froyo place can match the Belgian chocolate froyo at TUC, one simply cannot tell if they are having froyo or gelato. Add a few fresh, sliced strawberries and you\u0027d be all set. One other flavor that deserves a special mention is mango. It was sort of a limited edition and again, it was simply superb. Too bad it is off the menu now as I have always missed it, let us hope it is introduced once again. But TUC is not just a froyo joint, it has other plenty of amazing offerings on the menu. Pièce de résistance being the baked goods, the coffees, the foods and ofcourse if one wants froyo, that too, is on the menu.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-17T08:14:43+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-17T18:37:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"501447368","name":"Lubna Ashraf Jafri"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"509700022","name":"Hiba Akmal"},{"id":"100002308246996","name":"Sana Shah"},{"id":"501891633","name":"Komal Tauqeer"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk0MjM4NzQy","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"380846481966508","from":{"name":"Shafia Agha","id":"650845003"},"message":"excellent review!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T08:16:30+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"380846921966464","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Faisal Naseer, quite possibly the best and most honest review I have ever read...... that is the spirit of truth.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T08:18:25+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"380848571966299","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Faisal Naseer, i think majority of us who were on a FroYo spree last eve have reached the same conclusion.  very well written.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T08:25:16+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"380853551965801","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"Woah, what has fro yo done to u guys, aik kay bad aik honest and objective review, now i am not having one, is main kuch hai, very well written Faisal Naseer","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T08:42:18+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer","type":"user","offset":144,"length":13}]},{"id":"380853728632450","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Faisal Naseer very well put HAUTE COUTURE - SNOG is surely for the discerning few and totally the niche market. thu not a great business formula - a place where one is not going to run into everyone from everywhere","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T08:43:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"380857348632088","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"loll Najam Quddusi!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T08:54:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi","type":"user","offset":5,"length":13}]},{"id":"380861431965013","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"Zehra A.

Was advised on the phone to make it 8:30 to which I showed my inability so they very kindly acceded to my request to accommodate us at 9:00 for which I am extremely grateful to the management of CK.  reached at 8:50 pm to find the restaurant empty but soon other customers started to arrive and by the time we left at around 10:00 the place was still half empty (CK management, why was I asked to make my reservation 8:30 instead of 9:00 when the restaurant was not booked to full capacity?) the servers were very courteous and the food didn\u0027t take much time to arrive at the table - 10/10 for service. Starters - Hot \u0026 Sour Soup - was liked by all 4 of us but it was a bit too sour, would taste even better if the vinegar is put on hold, Wasabi Prawns - 4 decent sized prawns fried and coated in wasabi/creamy white sauce served luke warm and Crab Rangoon - creamy crab meat wontons served cold - 6/10 for starters.  Main courses, Mu Shu Chicken - DIY paper thin pancakes served separately with chicken qeema and a black sauce - very desi stuff, Kung Pao Chicken - chunks of boneless chicken in red sauce with veggies and cashew nuts which were liked by all, Beef Steak - chunks of beef with veggies in black sauce, again liked by all, egg fried rice and chicken chowmein (very salty with excessive use of soy sauce with hardly any chicken meat in it) - 7/10 for main courses.  Prices reduced since my earlier visit and quantities much improved, the above order would suffice 5 persons easily. Total damage approx 5K inclusive of soft drinks and 16% GST.
