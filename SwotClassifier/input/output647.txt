For me, any restaurant experience is a combination of food quality, service, ambience, company \u0026 final billing. I spent 2500 including taxes \u0026 tip, and came home sated \u0026 with a smile on my face. HLS is a good \u0027package\u0027 option: lovely ambience, welcoming \u0026 caring owners/ hostess \u0026 staff, excellent menu selection \u0026 plating, \u0026 yummy food. The seafood chowder was very rich \u0026 chunky, a full meal on its own, though not served as hot as it should. I tried various entrees \u0026 my preference lay with the zesty snapper \u0026 prawns a la rooni..the seafood katakat lacked flavour \u0026 zing, though the portion size \u0026 seafood content was extremely generous. I didn\u0027t care for the sorbets and chocolate cake on offer. Perhaps i\u0027ll have better luck with the other desserts on the menu. Pricing is ofcourse steep, but I think that\u0027s the price you pay for fresh ingredients, classy ambience \u0026 varied menu choices. All in all, would definitely go again.. A superlative experience!","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-01-25T16:38:07+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-25T17:47:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"},{"id":"1820897442","name":"Muhammad S Moten"},{"id":"584411137","name":"Farah Ali"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"731410527","name":"Aziz Noorani"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcwMTAwMTk4","before":"Njk0MjM4NzQy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"492842060766949","from":{"name":"Naveed Qazi","id":"600021922"},"message":"whats HLS?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-25T16:44:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"492843317433490","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"Haroon Leghari\u0027s Spot","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-25T16:47:37+0000","like_count":11,"user_likes":false},{"id":"492847640766391","from":{"name":"Mahvash Siddiqi","id":"724851212"},"message":"Ha ha @najam quddusi HLS is Hook, Line \u0026 Sinker @naveed Qazi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-25T17:02:59+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"492848597432962","from":{"name":"Naveed Qazi","id":"600021922"},"message":"Mahvash Siddiqi Khan and where is it?  been reading about it for a long time now but somehow do not remember the location.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-25T17:05:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"492848627432959","from":{"name":"Mahvash Siddiqi","id":"724851212"},"message":"And would like to add that the small touches were definitely noticed \u0026 appreciated, monogrammed cutlery and glasses being one of them...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-25T17:05:15+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"492848987432923","from":{"name":"Mahvash Siddiqi","id":"724851212"},"message":"@naveed Qazi its in the Swiss cottages row, next to china kitchen...

So some of you will have already seen the lovely photographs of the SWOT session at HLS.\n\nthose who were not able to make it were missed namely\n1) Abid Aziz Merchant\n2) Aalia Mahboob Elahi\n3) Syed Ghazanfar Agha\n4) Parisa Fatima Agha\n5) Anees Fatima Hakim\n\nThose who were there made the evening a sure shot success. Everyone loved the ambiance and the place is beautifully decorated and exceedingly welcome. The head honchos Haroon Leghari and Haider Zaidi have worked very hard and are seen interacting with their customers not once but several times. Their charming CSO Zara Tareen adds the right woman\u0027s touch.\n\nComing to the food - the team HLS had made us a fixed menu at my request. \n\nThe food:- \n1) SEA FOOD CHOWDER - thu some of the bowls were a tad warm when they came (but were warmed up immediately when pointed out) weas creamy, chunky and flavourful, needed a tad bit of salt but that\u0027s a personal taste and was added as per required, \n2) the tomato basil soup - was rich in colour and flavour, I had one spoonful to taste and liked the clear clean flavours.\n3) Caesar\u0027s salad - didn\u0027t try that so will ask the one person who did to please comment on it. \n4) zesty red snapper - one of my fav dishes was a medley of colours and flavours \n5) prawns ala Rooney - Haroon Leghari\u0027s personal recipe should be HLS signature dish. One point that was made and very valid - all the prawns in this dish have to be of the same size and weight, since its quickly cooked at high temps, the smaller ones got a little over done.\n6) seafood katakut made in pure butter is heaven on a plate.\n7) the dark chocolate gateau was divine..... Aamina Jahangir it\u0027s a pleasure to see your product maturing so well. It was a great cake.\n8) the mint lemonade at HLS knocks the rest out by a mile. It\u0027s refreshing even in this weather.\n\nFinal verdict.....HUGE GENEROUS HELPINGS, GREAT ATTENTIVE SMART SERVICE, BEAUTIFUL AMBIANCE. \n\nWE WILL BE BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN.......\n\nTHANK YOU FOR HAVING US.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-24T20:22:52+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-25T12:27:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"100003672338905","name":"Umbreen Mahmood"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"899930573","name":"Kiran Ali"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

However, I have been to Forty4 several times in small and large groups and at various times of the week / lunch / dinner. One of the most consistently noticeable comments from my friends has been to acknowledge the service in addition to the food quality, selection and value. That said, I am sure that there have been issues as Aman Virji has acknowledged. For the record, I would not hesitate to take groups of friends or professional colleagues to Forty4! One restaurant that remains unmentioned is Pompeii which should be in the running as they do meet all the same standards that Forty4 has for our dining experiences. Have not been to Thyme or The Patio so I cannot comment, although others have said good things about both places ... especially The Patio. Aylanto has disappointed us multiple times with respect to food and at our last visit, we actually left without eating due to issues with the attitude of the staff. For that reason, we have not been to Aylanto for many months now and therefore things could be very different by now so it is hard for me to offer anything more than our prior experiences while acknowledging the passage of time. Okra is not a place we have visited very often but many of our friends go there and I have never heard anything but glowing reports about the food with the only cautionary factors being the small size of the restaurant and sometimes the availability of reservations. Cafe Flo has its diehard fans or people like me who feel that it is nice enough but not among our first choices. Hope your dinner goes well, wherever you decide to go!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-24T15:57:36+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"797300590","name":"Aman Virji","type":"user","offset":398,"length":10}]},{"id":"492455000805655","from":{"name":"Saad Ahmed","id":"602358073"},"message":"Okra.
