As I walked in, loved the outdoor ambiance, as well as indoor. \nI ordered some chicken with turkey bacon which was delicious. The chicken was cooked to perfection (soft and tender), perfect seasoning that was not killing the taste of chicken, turkey bacon or cheese. Loved the sautéd veggies and baked potato slices with cheese. Tried grilled with Jalapeno sauce, which was tasty too. Ordered Peach Iced tea, which I didn\u0027t like. Iced tea is not everyone\u0027s cup of tea. Lemon Iced tea was too sweet, but we asked the waiter to make it less sweet, on which he was very sweet and took it away to change it. Later he told us that the sugar syrup was not mixed properly.\nOrdered Creme Brulee, profiteroles, Chocolate Fondant for dessert. Creme Brulee was creamy and not too sweet (which I liked according to my taste). I am not a big sweet fan. Some on the table didn\u0027t like, but it was something I would like as a dessert, which is not so sweet compared to Profiteroles and Chocolate fondant I tasted. Chocolate fondant was divine!\nAll in all, loved the experience and the food at Cafe Flo. Food and ambiance didn\u0027t disappoint me according to my taste.

The place is not very spacious and the menu is limited. However the staff is very courteous and the owner/manager helped us select dishes and place our order. We ordered tomatoe soup, Mint and Pea soup, and some chicken strips (can\u0027t recall the name) as appetizers. The chicken appetizer was drenched in oil but the soups were creamy and seasoned to perfection. We absolutely loved our main course of BURRITO BOWL WITH MANGO SALSA and THAI CHICKEN CURRY. Both dishes were delicious, especially the Burrito bowl. My friend thought the Thai Chicken Curry was the bomb...lol. Lemonade drink was perfect too. We also ordered Mango Pavlova for dessert. It was a disappointment. The cream and mango slices were not chilled. Not the best choice, they have other options too. Overall it was a lovely experience and will surely visit again.
