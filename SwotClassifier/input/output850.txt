I brought them home, lifted the toaster top stand and heated them up. This allows the butter to melt a bit, the light pastry crisps. Soft and tender layers inside, spicy simple chicken. Abid Aziz Merchant went on and one about them. Never believed him. But I stand corrected. Very amazing patties, Remind me of a bakery at Kings Cross station. The Cornish pasty.... divine. De Joe I am deeply impressed. Another translation of European baking in Karachi. The rest of Pakistan should be jealous.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-18T05:38:08+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-18T12:39:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"548630625","name":"Maheen Muzummil"},{"id":"508588993","name":"Saroasha Eng"},{"id":"513232132","name":"Nazia Latif"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"592813967","name":"Umme Hamdani"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQwNjE5NTEw","before":"NTQ4NjMwNjI1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"399778140073342","from":{"name":"De Joe","id":"597535350"},"message":"adnan thnks.. however, it wast a solo effort.. we had some great input from mr.\u0026mrs AA merchant, faisal and dr. swot....  i love the way u re heated the pastry....","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-18T05:54:56+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399828303401659","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Mr. Joe, no microwave used.
