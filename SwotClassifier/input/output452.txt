Two days later Madiha, the owner of Lals called me and very nicely asked me what my concerns of the desserts were, I really appreciate that she took out time to call me and listen to what I had to say- it shows that she is open to criticism, and that if a customer writes in a comment card it will not go unnoticed. So back to the food, she told me to go visit Lals a re-taste the crème brulee as the problem had been rectified, she was right! The crème brulee was light and perfectly crafted; every bite was heavenly and easily melted in my mouth. The only feedback I would give is that; Vanilla bean is always a good ingredient to add in a crème brulee also it is important to look into creating a separate chocolate crème brulee as Lals specialty is chocolate after all.  Thanks Lals :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-20T05:03:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-20T12:07:30+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"512612823","name":"Leena Faruqui"},{"id":"510525876","name":"Naeemullah Zafar"},{"id":"507563555","name":"Sara Omran"},{"id":"644815164","name":"Ahsan Pervez"},{"id":"1550100082","name":"Marium Siddiqi"},{"id":"645995992","name":"Rida Sadiq"},{"id":"563352743","name":"Saad Khan"},{"id":"1219353074","name":"Sarah Qureshi"},{"id":"652610620","name":"Anam Taha"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"1520294","name":"Hina Khan"},{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"},{"id":"100002371322898","name":"Sarah Mohiuddin"},{"id":"766095724","name":"Kashif Malim"},{"id":"100004861441059","name":"Ifrah Hameed"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"647272322","name":"Ainee Shehzad Salim"},{"id":"509568517","name":"Beenish Ehsan"},{"id":"100001691885342","name":"Ali Nadeem"},{"id":"726029467","name":"Saeed Ghauri"},{"id":"657151302","name":"Nishat Mustafa"},{"id":"13602460","name":"Aly Lalani"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"866695636","name":"Nilofer Gisela"},{"id":"100001574682511","name":"Hina Zaheer"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNTc0NjgyNTEx","before":"NTEyNjEyODIz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_573749712676183/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dMTAwMDAxNTc0NjgyNTEx"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"573751782675976","from":{"name":"Fayyaz Mallick","id":"100001390298951"},"message":"Thats great ..

The four of us ordered Goat Cheese \u0026 Fig Pizza, Parmesan Chicken, Caesar Salad and Old School Beef Cheese Burger along with 3 Lemontas and their Chocolate Brownie with Ice cream for dessert. \nThe pizza failed to impress me. True, it was light and baked to perfection but it lacked flavor and it kinda reminded me of homemade grilled cheese sandwiches. The burger was AHHMAZING! The Caesar Salad wasn\u0027t exactly great either, I know quite a few other places serving better version of this salad. The Parmesan Chicken however was delicious! Lemontas were, as always extremely refreshing and the chocolate brownie remains one of my favorite desserts in the city..Can\u0027t get enough of it really, it\u0027s a must try. \nAlso, the place desperately needs a UPS because while we were there, the electricity went and came at least 4-5 times. I guess that can be forgiven though considering the current state of the entire city when it comes to electricity issues. \nDespite a few minor flaws, there\u0027s just something about Xander\u0027s..Its always a pleasant experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-19T19:42:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-20T11:34:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"100004312209331","name":"Safi Hasan Rizvi"},{"id":"557711846","name":"Gulnar Kabraji"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"1795675310","name":"Maha Javed Chishty"},{"id":"501478359","name":"Mohammad Mikail Soomro"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"1460213785","name":"Hareem Kh"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1291671692","name":"Shehrbano Ibrahim"},{"id":"509209694","name":"Sheheryar Khan"},{"id":"100002850760185","name":"Nayab Ali"},{"id":"100003201386322","name":"Hera Ryaz"},{"id":"511368155","name":"Anam Amin"},{"id":"100001039943363","name":"Munawar M Shahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMDM5OTQzMzYz","before":"NTU3MzIxMjM2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"573599279357893","from":{"name":"Anam Amin","id":"511368155"},"message":"I agree with \"there\u0027s just something about Xander\u0027s\" that one finds their flaws forgivable.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:00:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573603826024105","from":{"name":"Moomal Shahab Channa","id":"512199353"},"message":"Thumbs up for the parmesan chicken at xanders","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:15:30+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573609312690223","from":{"name":"Sohaib Khan","id":"686900066"},"message":"I loved their mini burgers not sure what they called.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:36:59+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573610032690151","from":{"name":"Tehmina \u0027Manna\u0027 Khan","id":"549225127"},"message":"Oh yea those are awesome!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:39:54+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573863509331470","from":{"name":"Sarah Qureshi","id":"1219353074"},"message":"We have had horrible experiences there.
