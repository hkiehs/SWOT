Dinner at Olivetto after a long hiatus, and I doubt I\u0027ll be going back again.  The place has a formal ambiance, with Eminem talking about someone\u0027s mother, and some guys rapping about flying high like a Gulfstream.  The music being played was a disaster, and the place rivaled McDonalds and Burger King in playing the most retarded music.  \n\nThe bread served with Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar was fresh, and reminded me of the standard starters served on the Mediterranean coast.  Wouldn\u0027t mind having a more generous serving of Olive Oil, as what was served was barely sufficient for one person.\n\nOrdered the Arabic Platter, Meaty Lasagne, and Chicken Florentine for main course.  The Arabic Platter was brilliant, the lamb was moist, succulent, and juicy -- while the beef was cooked to perfection.  The pita was fresh, and the serving of Hummus was generous.  \n\nThe lasagne was a disaster -- it lacked texture, and the taste was just off.  Pizza Hut served a better lasagne once upon a time.  The Chicken Florentine was decent, but can\u0027t figure the nomenclature when it lacked the primary ingredient, i.e. spinach.   Also ordered Chocolate Molten Lava - it was grainy, and better offerings are served by other eateries.\n\nThe place levies a service charge, which basically means the patron pays a component of staff salaries, which is supposed to be built in the prices on the menu.  Soon enough, they may also start charging Generator Charges, Gas Charges, etc.  \n\nAs a policy, I don\u0027t like to go to places which have \u0027service charges\u0027 in place -- so I guess, I will be avoiding Olivetto for good.  If (almost) European prices are being paid in Karachi, and there is nothing special about the food -- a place is better off being avoided.\n\nOverall Rating -- 6/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-02T21:07:14+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-03T15:14:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1360134242","name":"Fahima Mubashir"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"},{"id":"1031220895","name":"M Saquib Khwaja"},{"id":"1086930427","name":"Ali Saif Memon"},{"id":"776525430","name":"Khadija Tahir"},{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"1198610816","name":"Maheen Siddiqui"},{"id":"746376004","name":"Sameen Shahid"},{"id":"851275369","name":"Belinda Fonseca"},{"id":"100001185864732","name":"Faryal Noman"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1247552277","name":"Abdullah Farooq"},{"id":"844625322","name":"Goher Zaman"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.
