The other option would be for us to reduce the prices by not using the best ingredients available in the market, something which we are not prepared to do. As an example, the beef burger or the roast beef sandwich is the same cut and quality used for our steaks at Cafe Flo. We hope that you visit us and judge for yourself and of course any comments that you may post after would be given attention. Sabah Rahman glad that you like the crab ravioli. The reason the crab ravioli is not as much as you expect is because crabs are one of the most difficult ingredients to clean, prepare and we have someone dedicated just for that. We can increase it but the price would have to as well, which would make us a full fledged restaurant instead of a trendy, gourmet cafe that we hope and wish to be. Nevertheless  all comments are appreciated and connstrucive criticism is the only thing that can help us improve at our weak points.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-11-30T16:51:20+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi","type":"user","offset":3,"length":10},{"id":"530610724","name":"Sabah Rahman","type":"user","offset":704,"length":12}]},{"id":"269265146457976","from":{"name":"Bilal Alvi","id":"641495625"},"message":"Alexandre Rizvi, i love your approach, and now, solely due to this very courteous post, I shall visit your café very soon and try out the food that I have heard so much about.

Divine indeed!, mom had the chkn quiche, chkn patties and the butter (don\u0027t rem the name, maybe Hamid can help) bun, all of them were scrumptious and bud tantalizing with the right savoury flavor to it!, just a small suggestion the patties was a bit dry as the outer crust was big and dry and the filling was too little!, then we tried the delicious Choclate ice cream which was as creamy and flavory as it could get with all the imported ingredients :), a ust try for everyone, next will go and have a meal there as the sandwiches were quite apealing :), It was a pleasure meeting Hamid personally! A great gentleman who trully knows what he is doing! And seems to know the confectionary and culinary business quite well :) the cafe prices looked reasonable and at par with other competitiors, but to be honest found the bakery items a tad bit higher :).....TUC  Good addition to the Zamzama lane of fame :)","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-01T15:02:19+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-01T15:57:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1249052648","name":"Shirin Ali Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTI0OTA1MjY0OA\u003d\u003d","before":"MTI0OTA1MjY0OA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"269691186415372","from":{"name":"De Joe","id":"597535350"},"message":"the bread was brioche, patties done some work on the puff  and filling ..... so we were were both on the same page. btw chocolate was gelato. glad u enjoyed it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-01T15:57:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjY5NjkxMTg2NDE1Mzcy","before":"MjY5NjkxMTg2NDE1Mzcy"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_269680866416404","from":{"name":"Aman Virji","id":"797300590"},"message":"Has anyone been to that amazon restaurant in badar commercial?

If I\u0027m not mistaken, I think it was Hav Joe who we met...and he was very kind and we had a nice chat...he let me sample a few items, the brownie was googie n moist! Very different from the ones I make but oooh...I can so imagine them in an ice-cream Sundae!!! And I\u0027m a frozen yogurt freak (I actually book my dubai transfers with a decent transit time so that I can grab pink berry at the airport) but looks like I don\u0027t have to do that anymore....I absolute LOVED the original flavor!! It beats berrylicious totally!! I wonder if they will start offering them with fresh fruits?? I grabbed some croissants, which were divine, and a couple of flavors of gelato. Only have tried a lill of the chocolate one and it was amazing!! Have 3 flavors left in my freezer, will attack when dad comes home. The only thing that didn\u0027t work out in my favour was that my sisters credit card wasn\u0027t working cause the machine was asking for a pin which has never been required before...so I ended up paying :p (I always have bad luck wid my sis, somehow ALWAYS her card doesn\u0027t work or she leaves her wallet home) note to self,.....never go out with my sis again to a food joint especially when\u0027s she\u0027s \"treating\".
