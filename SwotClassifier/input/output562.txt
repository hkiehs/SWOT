Such was my experience at Bella Veta, yesterday. \n\nA friend and me, decided to go there for coffee. I went there at about 5ish, usually a not so busy hour I guess as when I reached I was the only one there. The decor of the place is obviously nice and the cakes and gelato staring you from behind the glass counter tends to work your appetite. But the thing that damped the experience was the service. The waiters seemed to have lost the plot. They were rather loud. Talking loudly and crudely amongst each other. In one instant one of the guys told someone to \"daffa ho\" or something on those lines. And since there was no one there, the waiters did not seem to bothered clean the tables up, left vacant after the customers gone. Only when I went to my table the waiter cleaned the table. Reminding one of those nihari places. I would not have minded had it been a nihari place but this is suppose to be a upscale resturant if I am not mistaken. \n\nAnyways, enough with the bad service. Let\u0027s move on the good part. I only ordered the coffee but my friend ordered the stuffed mushrooms and a roasted beef club sandwich. The mushrooms were ok. Nothing to write home about. My friend however thought they were good. However the club sandwich was absolutely gorgeous. Huge sandwiches and they were quite generous with the potatoe wedges and the stuffings of the sandwiches. I sadly did not have any as I am on a diet but I will be sure to try them as soon as I am off my diet. Coffee was fairly good as well. On another brighter note, the prices seemed reasonable. Two water bottles, two cappuccinos and an order each of stuffed mushrooms and the beef club sandwich came to 1900 and change.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-03-31T04:54:01+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-31T04:54:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"517583112","name":"Rafia Farooqui"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3NTgzMTEy","before":"MTAwMDAxNDU2MDU5MDk1"}}},"picture":"http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/9650_10151848145112785_606355708_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10151848145112785\u0026set\u003dgm.530799920304496\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d3","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_530322033685618","from":{"name":"Faisal Naseer","id":"780902784"},"message":"Is Café 9 closed down?

I love Forty4. And why wouldn\u0027t I when the team, from Aman to the chefs, are willing to go out of their way to recreate an item no longer available on their menu? I had been craving Kampong rice from Forty4 and mentioned it to Aman the last se last time I visited. When I called to make reservations the other day, Aman was kind enough to call me back because he remembered my craving! He then went to trouble to check with the kitchen and then texted me a confirmation that one of my favorite yummies will be ready for me! And that\u0027s not all. Once I was served my requested dinner, he came by to ask if it was the same as I remembered it. And yes, it was! I had already been told jasmine rice is no longer stocked, which had originally been used, and I was perfectly happy just the same. I mean, puri zindagi wohi chaawal khaye hain na? Ab ziada hi-fi honay ki zaroorat nahin hai, \u0027kay? Although I was tempted to polish off my entire meal, there was an event I wanted to skip tonight, and I\u0027m kinda broke, so I didn\u0027t want to spend more than necessary. So here\u0027s what I did. I ordered the calamari and a caesar salad with grilled chicken, had two kim chi chicken hargows, packed up my kampong rice, and skipped right onwards to the churros and chocolate sauce, which I love, love, love! And this time, I got to finish it aaalll by myself. As for the kampong rice, you ask? Why, I ate it all just now, of course. Forty4 always makes me do the happy dance :D","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-30T16:09:23+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-31T00:37:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000554344923","name":"Salman Khan Nizari"},{"id":"786945014","name":"Samia Chundrigar"},{"id":"609791225","name":"Afrah Jamal"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"797300590","name":"Aman Virji"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE5MjM1ODcz","before":"MTAwMDAwNTU0MzQ0OTIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"530517653666056","from":{"name":"Aamir Dhedhi","id":"501737785"},"message":"Dont know these dude but im sure he is a rock star","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-30T19:03:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"530676986983456","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"That he is.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-31T00:37:20+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTMwNjc2OTg2OTgzNDU2","before":"NTMwNTE3NjUzNjY2MDU2"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_528248703892951","from":{"name":"Shabbir Hassan Mansha","id":"617719082"},"message":"Any suggestion for Sea Food Delicacy ?

Where do I begin? The experience was out of this world. We started off with the steamed Chicken Har Kow Dumplings. They were soft, succulent and full of zing and flavor. The sauces just put it over the top. All 6 disappeared in about 2 minutes, making me wish there were more. For the main course, we both had the Prime Tenderloin Beef Steak (medium well) and replaced the Chardonnay with a special low fat sauce (specially prepared for us upon order). From the first bite it was juicy, tender and full of flavor. Reminded me a lot of the types of steaks you find abroad. Really beyond expectation. On top of that, the entire experience was complimented with quick, polite and attentive service that really made us feel special (Safdar). Thanks for a wonderful night Café Forty 4.
