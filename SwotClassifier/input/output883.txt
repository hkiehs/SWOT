After consulting with Qamarunnisa Asim and Asim Mohammad Ali, we ordered Fish Cakes, Prawns in Red Curry, Chicken in Green Curry, Beef with Tamarind \u0026 Chillies and Steamed Rice. Everything was superb. Intensely flavoured and fragrant.. Tasted splendid and all made for an exotic meal. The only minor change that I\u0027d like to suggest is in the size of the prawns in the red curry.. These were very tiny, albeit abundant.. The rest was perfect and relished by my entire family! Well done, GD!
