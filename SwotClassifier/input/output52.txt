Though it was more on the spicy side for me.\n\nI did not try the other one but according to another fellow swottie it was also quite good.\n\nStarters:\nFor starters we had Chicken Drumsticks, Prawn balls and Prawn Toast.\nThe starters were cold initially but after requesting them to change it we were served with fresh hot ones. \nPrawn toast was a personal favorite .\nI found the prawn balls to be quite bland.\nThey being cold ruined the taste for me a bit.\n\nMains:\nFor Mains there was\nChicken Manchurian:\nMy much raved about personal favorite. Was a Disappointment at RE. The CM lacked gravy and was quite dry and too sweet. But had generous amounts of chicken. It was more of a mashed mush rather then a saucy Manchurian.\n\nBeef in Oyester Sauce:\nDefiantly got me going back for more. Was super yum soft and moist. Bit on the oily side though.\n\nVegetable in Coconut Curry:\nTasted okayish. The veggies were cut quite large making it hard to eat.\nThe coconut curry was an interesting blend of flavors though.\n\nVegetable Chowmein:\nAgain I found it quite bland. Nothing to write about.\n\nThere was one more dish I\u0027m forgetting.\n\nDesserts:\nThere was 5 kinds of desserts \nChocolate moose. Cheesecake \nCustard. Fruit chat. Walnut muffins.\n\nThe cheesecake was loved by everyone.\nI personally loved the chocolate moose.\n\nFRUIT CHAT on a Chinese buffet. Like seriously bhai kia chah rahay ho. Iftari thori hai :P \n\nOverall:\nHad an amazing time meeting up with the people who share the similar love for food. \nThe food was quite cold would have appreciated warmer servings.\nFor taste I would give it a 6/10\nChoice of dishes 5/10\n\nService on the other hand was exceptionally good.\nMeeting the owners themselves was quite pleasent.\nLoved our complimentey cups of greentea.\n\nPriced at 1100 per person. And promising 20+ dishes we found it quite disappointing in aspects of choice of dishes and taste.\n\nWould I go back for the buffet? NO.\nWill I go again because of their service at another time perhaps. YES.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-11T12:42:09+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-12T07:45:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"100001082786735","name":"Mahjabeen Khan"},{"id":"739935375","name":"Umer Latif"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"762775146","name":"Syed Faraz Baqar"},{"id":"524501080","name":"Zohaib Ali Memon"},{"id":"1107436825","name":"Xa?id Waqar"},{"id":"577774492","name":"Osamah Nasir"},{"id":"568861941","name":"Hassan Ahmed"},{"id":"1175769579","name":"Mohsin Mohiuddin"},{"id":"612945508","name":"Umair Shabbir"},{"id":"1282983841","name":"Hamza Kapadia"},{"id":"500786387","name":"Durand D\u0027Silva"},{"id":"100000114960083","name":"Irfan Lala"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"100000238497030","name":"Madiiha N Narrejo"},{"id":"733018407","name":"Nabeel Kazi"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"709830622","name":"Saqib Pervez"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzI3NzkxMjA1","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc0MDgxMjMx"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_665038480213972/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNzI3NzkxMjA1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"665040426880444","from":{"name":"Muhammad Abdullah","id":"1289258274"},"message":"Throughout the review your praising it but why so less score :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:47:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665041133547040","from":{"name":"Yasir Billoo","id":"807675696"},"message":"She is mainly praising it cause of the awesome company she was with :D right Ayesha :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:49:10+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha","type":"user","offset":77,"length":6}]},{"id":"665041723546981","from":{"name":"Muhammad Abdullah","id":"1289258274"},"message":"I\u0027m sure, must have been fun.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:50:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665042180213602","from":{"name":"Mazahir Ali","id":"520175866"},"message":"Another cake in the making.... :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:51:58+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665046013546552","from":{"name":"Fareha Zarsheen","id":"612250309"},"message":"I tried red emperor just once before n didnt like it much.

First impressions in terms of the environment were quite uncomfortable, considering that there were all men guests and my wife initially felt a little out of place... Eventually we realised that it was a men\u0027s night at port grand and men were allowed to enter without the entrance fee... As soon as the table turned it was a relieve to see families coming in Khanji ... Food: ordered a mutton ribs namkeen which was soon converted to mutton ribs spicy as the waiter insisted that we have the spicy version.. Also ordered a half mutton karhai... To be honest the food was okay , nothing great specially if you compare it with the same dishes that you get at BBQ. Tonight and salateen (opp. Ziauddin) .. The ribs were very tough and not served in a very appropriate way. The karhai was again ok.. Not too bad not to good.. ambiance : The place is not very well lit on the tables and it was a bit difficult to see what you are eating... The afghani kava with gur was just fabulous and all three of us enjoyed it ... I would rate the restaurant an overall 5/10 ... But again I think this is a new place and is probably facing teething issues... (Music came on and off . Waiter not well trained and the lights kept going and coming ) I would definitely visit again in sometime to see if they have improved ribs are a weakness for me so it would be definitely worth a shot...  Attaching a pic of the rib - pls note the pic was taken after I had already dug into it..
