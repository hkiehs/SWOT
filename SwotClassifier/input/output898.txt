We happen to go to China kitchen some time back for which I had made a reservation in advance. When we go there, I was told that we could not be accommodated inside where we were initially booked for and the only option was to sit out side. It was not a matter of sitting outside but the way the hostess put it was, take it or leave it. There was someone already sitting on then table apparently waiting for their table inside. Our guests started to arrive so we decided to just take the table. The setup was actually thrown on the table, without actually being. The way they  took the order was if we had done a favor coming to the restaurant. The food was very average - Dynasty @ Avari is still the best and there is no comparison. Anyway the dinner ended and as I drove off, I realized the I realized the left hand mirror on the door had been ripped and stolen. I called the restaurant back when I reached home I was spoke to the hostess who said to send her the bill for the repairs.  After having the mirror repaired thru the insurance i took the bill for balance payments as insurance companies deduct for depreciation. At the restaurant the hostess simply refused to accommodate as she says it was on the slip when I had the car valet parked that it was on my own risk. Her attitude was again rude and arrogant. Something which I should I have expected as she showed it the day we went there for dinner. I just took the bill back and walked out. While I do understand that cars are parked at owners risk, there is still a duty of care the owners are supposed to provide. She did mention that they have tried to remove the druggies from around the neighborhood who could have possibly stolen, but it was not there fault. Since then I have decided not to go there. I thought of posting this earlier but decided against it. The new restaurants, and the look restaurants must remember the first thing about hospitality it\u0027s customer service.

I wonder what sort of a nation have we become...I am sure Tutti Frutti is owned by some educated person who must be aware of basic ethics of doing business and paying taxes....I wonder why the educated lot in this country is the most corrupt and cheat without even feeling sorry for doing so???  More pathetic...they sit down and curse the way things are in Pakistan - little do they realize that they actually support this system and are happy the way things are!!!! I am aware that this is not the forum for this post....the only reason I am posting this comment is that it is likely to be read by a majority of people and hopefully more people will demand receipts for what they pay........Thanks for reading this.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-20T15:17:13+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-21T06:53:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"641326124","name":"Saad Habib"},{"id":"698885102","name":"Aamir Ghaffar"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"},{"id":"620275602","name":"Maria Jaffar"},{"id":"100000867562460","name":"Akbar Ashiq Ali"},{"id":"518040774","name":"Hira Kidwai"},{"id":"804492481","name":"Faisal Hassan"},{"id":"585622689","name":"Naveed Ismail"},{"id":"775921843","name":"Saad Amanullah Khan"},{"id":"680185313","name":"Khalid Ishaq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjgwMTg1MzEz","before":"NjQxMzI2MTI0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"382910151760141","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Are receipts for a few cups of froyo really that important.

I never complain about small issues with other restaurants either...for example last week during my visit to Xanders with a friend, there was a dead fly in his plate....when pointed out to the waiter, he just laugh and not a word of apology! Coffee and water arrived late despite reminders but no apology.....I never posted it here. Because some people do live their lives with TOLERANCE and understand that majority of people in Pakistan (the service providers) are not aware of basics simply because they are not given any proper training...so I dont blame them at all. The onus lies on people who open places without giving full training to their staff!!   The point I was trying to make was not about teething problems...it is about basic ethics and surprisingly here i have noticed that all teething problems boil down to where money matter are concerned.......BTW, I notice lot of tolerance amongst Pakistanis but for all the wrong reasons and at the wrong times!!!!  Its not about couple of cups ...it is about attitude and basic sense of ethics!!  I am sure you all know about this and I dont think it requires hard thinking......anyway, thanks for comments","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-20T16:29:22+0000","like_count":12,"user_likes":false},{"id":"382938078424015","from":{"name":"Khalid Ishaq","id":"680185313"},"message":"Unjela kaleem I must appreciate u pointing out at a very important issue now am going to b very careful where I dine in and always demand a receipt\nP.s ignore Adnan chaufary","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-20T16:35:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"382949945089495","from":{"name":"Saad Amanullah Khan","id":"775921843"},"message":"Agree with Unjela and we as a civil society must stop showing tolernace for breaking of rules and ethics -- that is why we are stuck in the current quaqmire.
