However we never realized that its going be this bad! Firstly, after constant requests, the waiter did not bother bringing us a menu. The waiter ended up coming after 20 minutes to take the order, and I thought that it was now time to relax! Well I was wrong to say the least, firstly, the music that was being played, gave me a headache! Nickelback playing in full volume is not something I expected to bear when I came to have a nice dinner with a relaxing cup of coffee. After at-least 45 minutes of waiting and begging for the food to arrive, my friend decided it was time to go and ask the manager what the scene was. \n\nThe reply which we got is as follows: “You will have to be patient, it’s a full house today, there is nothing I can do” \n\nWell the food finally came, and the guy forgot one dish! Here are my reviews to each dish:\nPizza – Extremely bland. Not well cooked or maybe lacked the ingredients. I’m no expert cook, so I don’t know the technicalities, but all I know is that it sucked and I would never want to have it again! The frozen food which I usually end up heating in the microwave for a midnight snack is better than this!\n\nThe Besharam burger -  Maybe a bad choice on my part, I don’t like burgers with sunny side up. But even after removing the egg, it tasted “Average” – No taste, nothing. Burger shack is a better place to have burgers not to forget MC DONALDS!\n\nBaragosht Roast burger – Once again, extremely disappointed. The burger was meant to be roasted. NOT TOASTED! It was a pity that it tasted so awful.\nSome rice dish (can’t recall the name) – best of the lot. Tasted far far better than other dishes and was worth the money.\n\nSheesha – Rs. 900+ tax. I don’t care if you fill the sheesha up with real fruits instead of flavor, it doesn’t get this expensive! And on top of that, anyone who sits outside HAS to order sheesha is their policy. But I’m not going to take credit away from you guys, the sheesha was good. But not worth the money.\n\nIn the end, I would just like to tell my fellow members here. Please think twice before you goto this café. Just because you think it’s a nice name and closest thing we have to starbucks. It is not an excuse to go waste Rs. 1,000 +/head on bad food. \n\nMoreover, a message to Sattarbuksh owners. \nSaying that this was a soft launch doesn’t cut it. Your service sucked and so did the food. If you cannot take so many people, then consider hiding a few chairs and tell people to stand and wait till anyone leaves so that you don’t end up serving bad food. Places like Kolachi, Aylanto etc.. have huge waitings at times and are jam packed. But they rarely ever ruin the food. \n\nOverall rating:\nFood – 2/5\nValue for money – 1/5\nAmbiance – 3/5\nService – 2/5\nThis is an experience that is not just confined to me. A lot of people who I know and saw that day on Sattar buksh have been treated in the same manner or worse. BEWARE!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-19T17:43:18+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-20T10:17:22+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"539145384","name":"Saher Shaikh"},{"id":"739680324","name":"Talha Shafiq"},{"id":"505446215","name":"Junaid Siddiqui"},{"id":"529385176","name":"Saad Afaq Zaidi"},{"id":"100005203746955","name":"Kamal Nawaz"},{"id":"569219957","name":"Naveed Ashraf"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"1126174456","name":"Safwan Arshad"},{"id":"847104238","name":"Saima Jabeen"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"504621889","name":"Aisha Nadeem"},{"id":"827180267","name":"DrJoyo Tabsheer"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"1620471256","name":"Shahbaz Javed Khan"},{"id":"559545082","name":"Ali Haider Bhatti"},{"id":"1264475887","name":"Muhummad Arshad"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"724450267","name":"Mariam Alee"},{"id":"1433484222","name":"Misha Dyer"},{"id":"644600639","name":"Hina Shaikh"},{"id":"509665369","name":"Faraz Ahmed"},{"id":"717445135","name":"Rukaiya Karim"},{"id":"512553759","name":"Subal Ashar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEyNTUzNzU5","before":"NTM5MTQ1Mzg0"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_621236637927490/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNTEyNTUzNzU5"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"621255087925645","from":{"name":"Sheharyar Mujahid","id":"500846017"},"message":"Well probably you came to the wrong neighborhood if you were looking for relaxation :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-19T17:48:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"621264774591343","from":{"name":"Saadia Tariq","id":"567975179"},"message":"Naha, if it says And finally relax and wipe away the remains of that amazing meal you just had, he went to the right place, they\u0027re probably not living up to their own words.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-19T18:16:37+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"621264894591331","from":{"name":"Saadia Tariq","id":"567975179"},"message":"*naah","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-19T18:16:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"621305947920559","from":{"name":"Hira Farooq Rasheed","id":"769195300"},"message":"Oh well, that\u0027s a disappointment :/  I was planning to visit SB this week.

The kind of prices you just shared, one can seriously go to any other place be it Kolachi or KOEL and get a whole lot better experience. If a place is open for food, the food needs to be good/great first. The service part goes hand in hand as you\u0027re a customer oriented business (like most of the businesses). If they don\u0027t take the customers seriously and charge them shit loads of cash for bad quality food and overall experience, they\u0027re simply screwed in the head to open up in the first place.
