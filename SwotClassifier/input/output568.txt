{"datums":[{"id":"165861103465048_525226520861836","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Disclaimer: You know it. This is going to be a long one.\nForty4 for dinner. An attentive Aman, and Ican\u0027tbelievehowyummythefoodwas, add to that the lovely company, and this is one of the bestest starts to the weekend I\u0027ve had in a loooonnnggg time. \nWe started off with Aman\u0027s warm welcome, and he helped immensely with our orders. We ordered the hot pot, prawn gambas, calamari, escargots and another chili-something prawns. The hot pot needed vinegar and chili paste and a touch of soy, and it was hearty, filling and flavorful, with all the different textures and flavors in perfect harmony. I\u0027m not a fan of breaded calamari, and Aman told me that if I didn\u0027t like it, he\u0027d serve it on the house. Let\u0027s just say he didn\u0027t have to serve it on the house. The prawn gambas was as brilliant as everyone who has ever claimed it to be...well..claimed. Escargots for the first time. Mr. Sultan was kind enough to show me how it\u0027s done, and can I just say that they might look ajeeb, but ohemgeezer, do they taste naaaiiicccceeee! Would I want to have them again, yes please! Although Ali S and Noman did think the chili prawn thingie and escargots ki servings were smaller than they should\u0027ve been, I only had one of each, so I didn\u0027t mind. Moving on to the mains, I stuck to my true and tried prime beef tenderloin with dark cocoa reduction flavored with tarragon. The sauce has a slightly higher note of bitterness, and the heat factor on the sauce has been upped since the last time I had it, which compliments the bitterness and slight hint of sweetness in the sauce. The meat itself however, was the star of the show. I can only wonder where on God\u0027s green Earth did  Aman manage to fine such beautiful cuts of meat from. Medium, uniformly pink through and through, slightly pinker in the center, unbelievably succulent and tender. I haven\u0027t had such amazing quality of beef anywhere, except maybe Okra\u0027s lamb shank, and that\u0027s saying something. Okay? I only wish I\u0027d gotten my main sooner than I did, but it was definitely worth waiting for. Mmmm mmmm! Dessert Aman was kind and generous enough to give us on the house. Churros with chocolate sauce, and a red velvet cake. But it wasn\u0027t just any red velvet cake. It was light, airy, creamy, with a smooth, light and not overly-sweet frosting. And who would\u0027ve thought that fried dough and chocolate sauce would be sooooooooooooooo good? Crispy, warm and coated with powdered sugar on the outside, and light, fluffy and soft from the inside. Add to that the sweet, slightly bitter notes that high quality chocolate is bound to have, I\u0027m shocked at my own self-control for not grabbing the churros and chocolate and yelling, \u0027Mine! Mine only! I no share!\u0027. \u0027Twas definitely a perfect end to a very pleasant evening. Once again, thank you to those who came, and I\u0027m so sorry those who couldn\u0027t missed out on some great food and great company.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-22T20:24:53+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-25T15:30:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"506455670","name":"Muhammad Jamal"},{"id":"786945014","name":"Samia Chundrigar"},{"id":"547717982","name":"Ali Waqar"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"504810399","name":"Zara Rehman"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NTA2NDU1Njcw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"525227380861750","from":{"name":"Ali Allawala","id":"652674858"},"message":"You\u0027ve made me feel hungry.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-22T20:27:41+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"525227597528395","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Yeesss!

Ordered a full chicken meal and a half chicken, side lines of hummus, roast potatoes and white pita. Food arrived after an hour and a half after being told at time of order that it would take 35-40 minutes. Chicken was luke warm (my son wants to write \u0027stone cold\u0027)- any case, it took away immensely from the flavour. The chicken could\u0027ve been juicier too and tasted a tad on the dry side. The potatoes were stone cold though and had to be reheated in the micro...i don\u0027t mind cold roasted potatoes but these were not quite cooked all the way through and had to be reheated for that purpose too. They tasted fine. The pita was fluffy and soft. We got a mixed delivery of white and brown even though we\u0027d requested for just white. Hummus, sauces and other condiments were lovely. I would\u0027ve loved a hot harissa type of sauce to go along with it, but that\u0027s a personal preference. All in all, an okay experience. I appreciate it\u0027s a new business and there will be teething issues. Hopefully they\u0027ll get resolved quickly. Will I order again? Er, i think i\u0027ll wait for the dine-in option so i can sink my teeth into a hot juicy piece of chicken like the name Rowtisserie conjures up.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-23T18:19:22+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-25T08:51:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"525839244133897","from":{"name":"Aqueel Haji","id":"749767604"},"message":"Extremely dissapointed with the experience!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-23T18:24:48+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"525856484132173","from":{"name":"Fatimah Jameel","id":"714178973"},"message":"My food was fantastic tonight.

Much to our amusement we got a free meal and by the time  our plates arrived we were famished. The Roasted chicken was quite delicious and fresh. There were tons of take away orders so I guess there may have been a few delays since it was their first day..Kamil humbly apologised and we decided to condone our delay. However, The size of the qtr chicken was rather small which Kamil also noted and even offered to have a another piece \"on the house\" but the helpings of the mezze platter had aleady sufficed. So despite the teething issues -which I guess is expected on a first day (potential restaurateurs pls take note) But at the end of the day Rowtesserie has a lot of potential.

The chicken was cooked well and while it wasn\u0027t hot, it was well wrapped in foil so it wasn\u0027t too bad. The chicken was not as moist as I expected but with the dipping sauces, ended up being a reasonably good main course. Pita bread was fine and generous in quantity. There were some good dipping sauces and salsa style of veggies that were tasty. \n\nThe sides were generally disappointing in their \"averageness\". The roasted potatoes were dry and not particularly appealing. The mash and gravy were fine but nothing special. The hummus was just alright in taste but given that it is the most expensive side on the menu, the quantity was really miniscule and the taste should have been more impressive. \n\nAll in all, no actual complaints about the food, but overall it just didn\u0027t compare particularly favorably to the traditional alternatives available. Maybe the food would have tasted better at the restaurant or will improve with the passage of time from adjustments due to consumer feedback and experience.  Would love to keep hearing what others are saying since we only tried one major item on the menu and there may be other things worth tasting.\n\nFor about 2200 bucks, I did expect a higher standard of taste but again, it may just take a little time for things to settle down since this is such a new establishment. We\u0027ll just have to give it some time and try Rowtisserie again to see if things are any better. However, I will say that they seem to have responded well to the initial delivery time issues so maybe there is hope for the rest!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-24T17:46:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-24T18:51:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNDU2MDU5MDk1","before":"ODQwNjE5NTEw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"526483150736173","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"i have not checked the menu yet - but all i hear is CHICKEN CHICKEN - dont they have beef/lamb or even mutton\n\ni am not going to eat chicken","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:42:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"526485184069303","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"They hv beef shawarma.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:48:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"526485470735941","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"oh thank god","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:49:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"526485787402576","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"I\u0027ll wait for them to start dine-in to give Rowtisserie another shot.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:50:43+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"526486047402550","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"i will do a take away in about 2 weeks - if they dont start dine-in by then\n\nIrfan Ismail am taking you up on your offer","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:51:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail","type":"user","offset":77,"length":12}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI2NDg2MDQ3NDAyNTUw","before":"NTI2NDgzMTUwNzM2MTcz"}}}}]}
