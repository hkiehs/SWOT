As are the fries.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-10-27T16:30:51+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-28T05:03:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"100005945647613","name":"Sara H Khan"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"512542175","name":"Nabiya Fahad Khan"},{"id":"561071696","name":"Kamran Hashim"},{"id":"600940187","name":"Shakaib Nawab"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"629799782","name":"Nusrat Alamgir Shah"},{"id":"514407087","name":"Saad Aslam"},{"id":"690914766","name":"Ayesha Mallick"},{"id":"1277228905","name":"Rehan Ahmad Khan"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"100001816848014","name":"Subhana Rahman"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Okay i understand they were starters but for Rs. 1000 it could have been better.\nArabic platter had kebabs, shish touk, lamb chops and humus... kebabs were perfect so was humus and shish touk..But; \nThe lamb chops were such a big No,,, the meat was extremely soft - no bite - it was like gulping it down rather than chewing it (like you have cereals in hot milk)... The chops were thin (you could compare it with the skewer sticks) it was kind of tasteless in itself, had some sort of sweetness and gelatin layer at the top... Couldn\u0027t eat it after few bites..
