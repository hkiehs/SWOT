They also offer Chinese food on their menu. Ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Malai Tikka, Beef Bihar, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Chicken Bihari along with nans. As this place was primarily a broast chicken joint for the last twenty five years, diversification to healthier option is a good sign. The bbq was excellent, very fresh meat, juicy and grilled to perfection, a must try and quite reasonable, six dishes, nans and a large mineral water all for Rs. 1170.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-31T17:22:27+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-02T09:53:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1198597312","name":"Muhammad Raza Jamil"},{"id":"680185313","name":"Khalid Ishaq"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1454993708","name":"Tehniyat K.
