However the food taste was excellent. The portions were small. We ordered Handi, Hunza kabab which was outclass and melt in mouth like butter. Malai boti was very soft and smooth but lack of some strong flavour. In addition just to taste and sense the flavor of continental food we ordered Pasta which is again very delicious and highly recommended. The only gap is in their services where each waiter and server take care of 2-3 table at the same time and in certain situation they do not answer U which make us frustrated.
