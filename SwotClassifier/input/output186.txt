And that\u0027s the only thing that was lacking in that area. \n\nThe place it self is lovely, still not yet open so parts were being worked on. RED was the predominant color, in fact I don\u0027t think there was any other colour. But the sea was lovely the wood work solid and the full moon made the ambiance gorgeous. Yes it\u0027s very red, with lights, carpet chairs all red. But what is a Chinese without the red.\n\nThe food was limited since it was just an soft launch. But was good and each item tasted different. As the weather gets cooler the soups will become more popular. One tip thu the prawn crackers didn\u0027t survive the humidity - thu were fresh when came to the table....wilted almost instantly. Soups arrived hot and each one was different from the other. The chicken corn was actually great, the seafood coriander very nice and the hot \u0026 sour. Starters had steamed wontons and prawn tempura which I was happy to see, steamed wontons/dumplings (dimsum) is a fav and thank god becoming popular here too. The rice and noodles were both well seasoned and cooked well. In fact many commented how nice the rice was on its own. Chicken Schezuan was amazing as was the beef chili dry, and honey chicken with sesame (a little too sweet for my taste) the sticky sweet fish I don\u0027t like anywhere and this was no exception thu really liked the lemon fish. \n\nAll in all a good evening spent with great friends checking out a new place. We wish them all the best and hope that the few issues they were facing will be sorted out before the hungry crowds of discerning Karachiites arrive.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-19T06:01:40+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-20T18:17:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"724148371","name":"Rabia Hai"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"514292991","name":"Marium Hosein"},{"id":"547501074","name":"Rehana Naseer"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"522977702","name":"Sheikh Hasan Rasul"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"504517271","name":"Usman Tanzeel"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"622525326","name":"Mohsin E Azam"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"511301771","name":"Eefa Khalid"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI0NDc2NzM1","before":"NTg0NjgyMjQz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_620982761286211/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNTI0NDc2NzM1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"620983104619510","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"The place does have a name but its not yet put up outside.

WHOAWOWOWWHATHEAVEN!! and i dont even like chocolate! a beautiful crusty tart with not overozzy chocolate centre and a good balance of almonds. was not sweet, lovely served warm and just a delight.

It is located right above Butlers Chocolate Caf on main Zamzama (where New York Caf once was).\nRight from the entrance in the side lane to the restaurant itself, the management seems to have paid a good deal of attention to detail in the dcor and have kept the place spotless (so far).\nWe ordered a bunch of things, but what really stood out were the Parmesan Crusted Chicken in Orange Sauce, and their Seafood Salad.\nWe were served complementary bite-sized appetizers, and an assortment of bread with sundried-tomato butter and garlic butter.  Although these were pretty good, but Im still a fan of the bread they serve at Pompei Restaurant.\nThe chicken had 2 generously-sized juicy fillets that had been batter fried and topped with orange sauce. This combination of flavors made a perfect blend (unlike most people have been able to do with pretty much any dish that has an orange sauce). The dish is served with side of vegetables and gratin potatoes.\nThe Salad was extremely impressive on its own and is a great meal for any seafood lover whos looking to eat something refreshing! It had an assortment of shrimps, calamari, lobster and scallops served with iceberg lettuce. This was a very substantially sized serving that seemed perfect for a healthy lunch, or a filling dinner if accompanied with a starter or desert.\nUnfortunately we were so full after this meal that there was no room to even think of ordering anything for desert (note for my next visit: order less in the appetizers and save space for desert) \nIt was disappointing to see the low turnout at this restaurant unlike most Zamzama eateries (even on weekdays). However Im assuming one should make reservations if you plan on going on a weekend.\nWould highly recommend Sams Place for a quiet dinner (ironically right in the middle of Zamzama), or a bright and sunny lunch (the space has great big windows to let in loads of natural light in the day).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-20T07:05:35+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-20T13:28:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"882650316","name":"Sabah Shaikh"},{"id":"646760193","name":"Rehma Tirmizey"},{"id":"814525594","name":"Sohaib A Junaidi"},{"id":"505596876","name":"Samia Salman"},{"id":"591827743","name":"Tuba Arshad"},{"id":"515754753","name":"Hala Anjum Syed"},{"id":"505430448","name":"Nabeel Da"},{"id":"665006600","name":"Cyma Almakky"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY1MDA2NjAw","before":"ODgyNjUwMzE2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"621729241211563","from":{"name":"Zainab Abidi","id":"502297291"},"message":"Dude we wnet there and their service was painfully slow which ticked me off","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-20T07:08:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"621753764542444","from":{"name":"Amal Anis Makda","id":"542900496"},"message":"same here went there... ordered one of their mushroom steak... dont exactly remember the name of the entree\u0027..Despite, being a  beef steak  it wasnt juicy as expected.There was a weird stinking smell in the beef like something had happened to their meat in the fridge.The flavor was bland and tasteless to the extent that i had pack the whole thing and give it to the beggar on way.All they had served was a huge chunk of beef in the plate with the same bizzare creame mushroom sauce on top of it..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-20T09:29:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"621828617868292","from":{"name":"Maryam Maqbool","id":"652495530"},"message":"Agreed Mikail.
