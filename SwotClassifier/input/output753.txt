Sure the decor and waiters carried on the whole western theme, but the food was inedible. The burgers (previously ranked number one on my list) could not even be ranked. The only positive thing I can possibly say about the burger was that the bread was fresh. \n\nThe \u0027sizzling steak\u0027 was anything but, it looked like it had been sitting in the corner of the kitchen, dried out and sad!!! This was true for the buffalo wings aswell, the sauce was dried and congealed. I did not touch them. \n\nOut of the seven people there not one of us was happy with our order.
