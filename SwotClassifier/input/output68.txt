An awesome selection for people to enjoy some Pakistani traditional food,  besides their regular breakfast items Buckwehat bagels and eggs, granola, cheese and mushroom omelette, the herb omelette all were made perfectly served with multigrain bread. Ordered Pomegranat juice, to wash down the food, which was again as requested had no ice, additional water and a natural wonder pleasing my guests all along. My colleagues were totally amazed, thankful and really enjoyed the morning and the food, complimented me on a great selection of place.  I will right away give A+ to the food, service this trip, they were exceptionally cooperative to make small adjustments; I wanted cottage cheese in place of cream and they got me, kept the chillies and oil low.
