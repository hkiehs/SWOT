The winning point for the Indians came from her because Biryani is a personal favourite of hers. This is not a proper criterion to score a dish. I am not doubting her patriotism or objectivity, but fairness requires a purely Paki judge (of which there is no shortage). Sonia seems to have been chosen because she’s known in India and infuses glamour in the show. Moreover, Vir has made a public comment in favour of India, why is there no encouraging \u0026 supportive comment in favour of Pakistan?
