I even loved their weird sweet pumpkin dessert.\n\nToday was no exception for the 7 of us - since the 8th one forgot to RSVP (which by the way means you are getting NO more invites from me) - debated between CHINA KITCHEN or FUCHSIA (ok I put up the debate everyone else was unanimous) - short story long we landed up at FUCHSIA.\n\nI arrived a few minutes late to find my friends seated comfortably, half had ordered and one was enjoying a fluorescent blue drink - something margarita. \n\nThe order was taken by a very competent Irfan. Loved his smiling face and courteous nature, also when he conspiratorially told me on a few orders \"madam order two,  one will be too little\" I knew he was our perfect host for the evening......he had understood here are the eaters. SWOT gatherings are dry....we concentrate only on the food and its quality.\n\nWhat all did we order:-\n1) clear Tom yum soup with seafood,\n2) the cloudy Tom  yum \n3) the coconut cream based Tom yum gha soup \n4) papaya salad without prawns (hence chicken)\n5) papaya salad normal\n6) soya beef (oh god in wish I had order one for each)\n7) Thai prawn cakes.\n8) beef in oyster sauce,\n9) dry beef chilie (divine)\n10) wok fried prawns \n11) chicken red curry\n12) spicy Pad Thai noodles,\n13) stir fry glass noodles,\n14) chocolate mousse (3)\n15) fried chocolate wontons with green tea ice cream (2)\n16) iced Thai tea \n17) fuchsia coloured piña colada\n18) orange juice (only thing disappointing on the order)\n19) cold drinks\n20) green tea.\n\nHOLY SWOT......did the 7 of us seriously order and eat all this food. WOW WE ARE PAITOOS.\n\nit was an unprecedentedly a great evening. Loved every morsel of what we ate. I will love the left overs for naashta, since I  scraped all the sauces from all the curries and dishes in to one - like a Thai Haleem. \n\nToday I discovered that I am a little low on some vitamins - after this meal the vitamin C from the birds eye will cover all that.\n\nTeam Aylanto - this is e best thing you could have done for Karachi. \n\nOne point - it\u0027s amazing that the best chocolate mousse in town is served at a Thai restaurant.

The fries they came up with used to be literally ice-cold and nearly impossible to swallow without the drink. The buns were stale and most of the times the drink used to spill all over the burger making the bun sweet and soggy but guess what? That was an old story c: Just ordered \u0027The Turkish\u0027 I guess their limited edition burger. The food was received with in twenty five minutes where as the limit was forty five minutes (y). The drink was ice cold and the orangy fanta flavour was still intact .. The fries were super crispy and full of that salty kick .. Oh well the burger? It was a hit :) Pickles in nearly every other bite .. Crunchy ice berg with a heavenly taste of that tangyy mayo .. The patty was huge .. Bigger than the bun (y). Slices of tomato with pickles and ice berg were so very friendly to the taste buds where as the fries and the drink along with it made a wonderful late night meal! McDonalds for me is on the charts again .. I hope they make their service better and better. \u0027The Turkish\u0027 is a limited time offer and the fact sucks in itself.

Since they moved thats a different story. My friends love the place - frequent it as much as twice a week. I just never have a good culinary experience there. \n\nWent for a friends farewell this week, around 12 people.\nOrdered off their new menu. Was so happy they listened to feedback and added  new dishes. Ordered cheese parcels as appetisers. The pastry was fluffy and the cheese was exquisitely creamy. The dips that went along with it balanced the parcels perfectly. We ordered salmon and garlic chilli prawns - those were pretty good too.\n\n3 people ordered lasagne, 2 orders came on time with the rest of the order\u0027s. I had ordered the Chicken Cannelloni and was really excited to try something off the new menu. My friend and I were the only 2 people waiting for our food, even though a friend who\u0027d turned up last and had ordered after appetisers, was even served his steak before us. So we waited for our lasagne( shouldnt they serve people who ordered the same thing together?) and C. Cannelloni and it arrived 10 minutes later. Looked delicious I wont lie was worth the wait. I had a couple of bites from one side loved it even called for red pepper flakes as i like my food spicy. As I cut the other side I saw the chicken was PINK, raw and undercooked. I called for the manager who whisked it away without listening to my complaint. He brought it back around 5 minutes later when I couldn\u0027t eat anymore. Did not offer an apology, took it back, didn\u0027t bother with feedback, nor with chucking it off the bill absolutely nothing. That\u0027s just bad management. The waiters started cleaning up before we had asked for the bill while my friend was still having his 7up. \nAt this point I was kinda mad too. \n\nSo I dont think Im going back there anytime soon. had this happen there a few times and the management is just iffy.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-08T17:28:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-08T19:08:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"513271612","name":"Arghan Tahir"},{"id":"686712045","name":"Irfan Aslam"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg2NzEyMDQ1","before":"NTEzMjcxNjEy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"536458046405350","from":{"name":"Irfan Aslam","id":"686712045"},"message":"Agreed","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-08T17:36:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"536458609738627","from":{"name":"Talib Amin","id":"785200197"},"message":"I too have noticed an over all behaviour of haste by the staff.

While I understand that this forum started out as a place where the admin\u0027s friends and family could discuss eateries in the city and suggest places as and when needed, I do have a few reservations. There is no doubt that there is a lot of useful information available on SWOT. Every time I am stumped when scouting for a particular ingredient, Swotties have always helped out. However, the fact is that this is a public forum brings with it certain responsibilities that both members as well as the owner(s) of the group should understand. If this were a drawing-room-discussion type forum where only friends and family gathered to give opinions, one would understand the idea this is not a democracy that is being advocated here. Its okay to be biased when your opinion only matters to a select few  the few being the ones you love and cherish. \n\nHowever, when you turn into an 8,000-plus open group that provides reviews and insights about Karachis eateries, you just cannot be biased. You just cannot dismiss everything with the statement: my group, my rules. We all know that information on SWOT carries weight among both consumers as well as restauranteers. When a complaint is lodged here, most, if not all, restaurant owners do sit up and take notice, because they know some 8,000 people are reading what is being said here at any given point in time. Thats a big number; a potential market share that they may just lose out on if they dont do damage control. So please excuse the impudence, but I dont agree when I am repeatedly told that this group CANNOT be impartial. \n\nAs a media practitioner, I often struggle with objectivity but the battle is won when I repeat to myself what I learnt in college: objectivity lends credibility. Its really that simple. Whether the members of this group like it or not, they are in some way or the other, citizen journalists. And as citizen journalists, while you have the right to call a spade a spade, you are also saddled with the cumbersome task of exercising that freedom with responsibility. Otherwise, I do think this group should have a closed membership, open to only a select few who are, in fact, the group admins friends and family. Then, you can be a democracy, autocracy, theocracy or any other kind of cracy and it really wont matter. \n\nSocial media is a dynamic, fast-paced and highly interactive medium of communication. Even the most experienced media professionals today are still experimenting with this medium because the information provided here and the subsequent feedback cannot be controlled. Thats why several big corporations are hesitant to dabble with it, because they really do not want bad press. Because they know that large-scale, multinational enterprises are often viewed with suspicion and social media may just reinforce that idea in the minds of the people. Still, it is here for good and while we continue to figure out the kinks in its system, for now the least we can do is let good sense, restraint and level-headedness prevail on it  the way it used to be once upon a time in the good, old days when the media was considered a fourth pillar of the estate and valued for that very reason.\n\nSorry if this post has turned into a rant. As always, I mean no disrespect or offense to anyone. Ill understand if Im shown the door after this lecture on what sounds like a page out of my media laws and ethics class.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-08T12:03:38+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-08T15:47:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"899930573","name":"Kiran Ali"},{"id":"37519583","name":"Amna Khalique"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"1198610816","name":"Maheen Siddiqui"},{"id":"892195391","name":"Tehreem Fatima"},{"id":"100001222084644","name":"Talal Shah"},{"id":"871750088","name":"Adnan Rao"},{"id":"804492481","name":"Faisal Hassan"},{"id":"596754528","name":"Minhaj Haider"},{"id":"1377186173","name":"Owais Mahmood"},{"id":"553586655","name":"Ambreen Intizar"},{"id":"856955690","name":"Tooba Asim"},{"id":"619270706","name":"???
