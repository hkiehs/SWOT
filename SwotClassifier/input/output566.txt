It shows a sign of being unprepared. Howver, I have noticed that no matter how prepared one can be - they often underestimate the activity deprived society we reside in. That being said the initial response an eatery gets is rather overwhelming as some may put it. For that, you really cant blame them. \nI do understand however that people sometimes may feel cheated, or not getting their moneys worth. That would make someone rather upset. Now with all these public forums, people have an access to express their emotions - good or bad. Once we start reading a bunch of good posts about a place, our expectations are rather high. Yet, once we actually get the luxury to dine at said resto with glorious reviews our experience was no where near \u0027mind blowing\". But hey, thats natural; its like going to a movie with craaazy reviews - once u see it your like \"I expected more :s\".\nHowever, back to the topic at hand. Yes teething issues will occur no matter how prepared one is. You can prepare for having a kid for the entire 9 months; but its a whole new ball game once he/she are there. Personally, I dont go to new eateries for the first 3 months. I believe that gives them ample time to iron out their issues - that is if they want to. One would generally get a better feel of if then as they are by now on regular practice. \nAs Oscar wild said \"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about\".","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-25T09:47:20+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"526767617374393","from":{"name":"Gulraiz Khan","id":"500068206"},"message":"Ammar, the pricing issue is not entirely true. The cost of operating a restaurant in Clifton/Defence is NOT ten times lower than the cost of operating one in, let\u0027s say, Montmarte area area of Paris, or Kreuzberg in Berlin, where you may find restaurants of similar pricing points. In Karachi, add the additional cost of security, generators, strikes, kharab halaat, bad economy (not enough footfall) etc and then you\u0027d realise that all restaurants that charge between 1,000 to 1,500 per head DO NOT have fat margins.. Plus, cost of ingredients is actually pretty european.. A bell pepper costs Rs175 here, which is pretty much what it would cost you in berlin. All imported ingredients, and good meat, is expensive..
