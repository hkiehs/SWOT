We ordered a Double Diner deal with half Gourmet Vegetarian, half Pepperoni on extra-thin crust and Jalapeno cheese balls as appetisers.\nThe food arrived on time, piping hot, smelling divine! Apparently they forgot the Gourmet Vegetarian half and made it a full Pepperoni which was a bit of a bummer [boo hoo :( ] till we started eating and oh my, did that change everything or what? The marinara is to die for. The crust, just right. Pepperoni was just the right thickness not too thick to go soggy and not too thin to have become leathery.  The Jalapeno Cheese Balls were a total hit, absolutely \"you can\u0027t have just one\" type addictive, just a suggestion though, if you can cut down on the flour and load up on crumbs instead it would avoid the floury after taste since cheese balls are usually fried at high heat and quickly so the flour coating if thick is left under-cooked on the inside. Remember, thin flour coating, thick breadcrumbs one :) Great food, Pizzo.

Wanted to order the mid-night special deal for 4 (which has 2 pizzas) - but they had only 1 pizza left to serve at like 0200PST.  No point of a midnight/sehri type deal when they\u0027re running out of food early - and it wasn\u0027t like the place was full or anything.  And yea, they ran out of mineral water bottles as well.\n\nOrdered Pizza de pollo (or something on similar lines), Roast Beef Sandwich, Turkey Sandwich, and Nachos - the roast beef sandwich was the worst I\u0027ve ever eaten, CHIPS serves a way better sandwich at a third of price.  The Turkey Sandwich \u0026 Nachos were decent.  There was nothing special about the pizza as well (it was good, but nothing out of this world) - much better pizzas are available at better prices, so that was a disappointment too.  And the mint lemonade was just depressing.  On the flipside, the Strawberry Cheesecake Gelato was excellent - but TUC\u0027s a more reasonable option on the gelato front.\n\nAnd the pizza is just depressingly small for the price.\n\nAs a friend remarked, \u0027dil bhar gaya, magar pait nahi bhara\u0027.

I would not have bothered replying if it was coming from one of many known self-appointed food connoisseurs and saviors of taste buds around the city; found mostly on Facebook food forums at all times of the day, their frustrations justified by the amount of time they spend ranting about the food they eat. And no, I won\u0027t be naming them. I am replying because it is coming from an educated person like you who I believe belongs to a respectable part of society and must have a genuine grievance to repeat such a complain everywhere possible. Whatever it may be, please accept my personal apology. With that said, I assure you, our \u0027beef\u0027 is purchased from Makro, which does not sell scrap or left overs no matter how nicely you ask, the beef is then minced at our restaurant, the trimmings and fat are cooked, with left over pita, bread, chicken and rice, and fed to my dogs, I have four; very loving, all of them.  Anyway, so we make an honest living by selling only the best available ingredients on the market, the sauces, marinades, and spices are all prepared at home in presence of at least one family member. While there is a margin of error in every food outlet, the climate not being very friendly and dependable staff being a constant nuisance, I can understand if the food you ordered arrived under- or overcooked, or if the spices were too little or too much, or something similar. But to accuse us of selling low quality food on purpose is unacceptable, not only because I\u0027m saying so being a representative of Damascus, but also because it is the same food I eat at home, five days out of seven. I invite you to Damascus, make it a surprise if you like, we can both order a burger each to see what left over scrap I\u0027m selling, \u0026 I promise not to cheat. Have a good day.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-27T14:25:41+0000","like_count":14,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]},{"id":"417525288298627","from":{"name":"Omar Khan","id":"517798722"},"message":"I do love your dogs!
