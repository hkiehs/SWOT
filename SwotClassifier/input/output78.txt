Why is it necessary to even COMPARE the two? Each eatery should be reviewed independently without being compared to something else. Comparison is never a good thing. Just because Person A likes something, doesn\u0027t always mean that Person B HAS to like it too. Every individual has their own sense of taste and preference.

Why point fingers and make personal comments. Your opinion is yours theirs is theirs. There is no competition nor is there a prize for the reviews. Since all these eating places are run by humans and the food prepared by humans I am sure there is a wide margin of errors. Everyplace should tried 3-4 times over a period of that many months for any review to be taken seriously. I had Burger Shack twice in that many weeks when it opened - found it average. I am not saying they have not improved - which i am sure they have. Gormet burger was quite bad after the first few months of its opening. But now past their 30 months they are quite good. So when you say what some one was smoking when they had something implying they are either high or making false claims you are being rude to comeplete strangers, people whom you have never met nor know.

For appetizers we ordered the seafood chowder (soup), cream of asparagus and roasted tomato \u0026 basil soup. \nThe highlight was the seafood chowder that tasted like nothing else on this planet! Don\u0027t have words to explain how much it was busting with flavor...It was love at the very first bite, for each and every one of us!\nThe remaining 2 soups tasted really really good too!\n\n2. Ordered the following for Main Course:\n\n* Seafood Kata Kat (something totally different, and a must for every seafood lover)\n* Prawn Masala (deliciousness personified)\n* Crabs Subzwari (to die for)\n* Grilled Red Snapper with chilli sauce (bohot aala!!)\n*Chicken Tornados (wow)\n\nAmbience \u0026 Service: Delightful\nFood Taste \u0026 Quality: Unparalleled to any other seafood in town. Absolutely Divine!\n\nMinuses: Food is irresistible \u0026 highly addictive\n\nMr. Haroon Leghari You really got all of us HOOKED! Thank you for such a wonderful experience \u0026 many more to follow In Sha Allah!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-23T23:57:46+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-24T10:41:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100006717730226","name":"Cafeela Authorities"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"1776679200","name":"Khurram Jamal"},{"id":"1553621640","name":"Lybha Nadeem"},{"id":"100001640822737","name":"Khadija Jatoi"},{"id":"100001089240373","name":"Abdul Basit Sivany"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"100000059823691","name":"Haroon Leghari"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"1023534896","name":"Uzma Merchant"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTc1Mjc2NzUy","before":"MTAwMDA2NzE3NzMwMjI2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"656540207730466","from":{"name":"Haroon Leghari","id":"100000059823691"},"message":"Thank you so much Shumyla ...delighted you had a great experience!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-24T10:41:15+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjU2NTQwMjA3NzMwNDY2","before":"NjU2NTQwMjA3NzMwNDY2"}}}}]}
