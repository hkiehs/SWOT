Beats all the burger joints hands down.  The Iron Man is probably the best cheese burger in town.  Great pricing, efficient service, quality stuff.  Wish they had a dine-in facility coz I hate to do takeaways but anyway this is one burger for which I wouldn\u0027t mind standing in a queue.  Good job - The Burger Factory.....very well done......you\u0027ve got a regular customer if you maintain the quality.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-21T19:27:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-22T15:48:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"746190586","name":"Hussain M Raza"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"508001645","name":"Sabeen Khan"},{"id":"100000956691585","name":"Sauliha Qureshi"},{"id":"1134812784","name":"Amjad Siddiqui"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"584642194","name":"Fatima Shafiq"},{"id":"734228975","name":"Rizwan Mustafa Yusuf"},{"id":"100002308246996","name":"Sana Shah"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"574028031","name":"Shiraz Qureshi"},{"id":"502557411","name":"Omer Saeed"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"100007013108103","name":"Marium Khan"},{"id":"728987421","name":"Rayyan Sohail"},{"id":"580555830","name":"Sanam Bilal"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"531862946","name":"Taha Munir"},{"id":"1006929463","name":"Qurat Sheikh"},{"id":"100002680841411","name":"Sid Khan"},{"id":"667185780","name":"Tahir Karimi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY3MTg1Nzgw","before":"NzQ2MTkwNTg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"655064227878064","from":{"name":"Asad Kazi","id":"505035509"},"message":"location??","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-21T19:28:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"655064547878032","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Kh-e-Muslim/Bukhari Commercial","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-21T19:28:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"655065114544642","from":{"name":"Faizan Mukarram","id":"1023815310"},"message":"finally a review from a reliable source :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-21T19:29:43+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"655065811211239","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"MA y no pic? deals, prices? :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-21T19:32:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"655066211211199","from":{"name":"Muntaha Mirza","id":"680000641"},"message":"Waseem Babar","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-21T19:34:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"648938642","name":"Waseem Babar","type":"user","offset":0,"length":12}]},{"id":"655066231211197","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"I forgot to take pics.
