Just the rice as I don\u0027t eat much seafood.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-03T05:10:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391352714249218","from":{"name":"Afroza Bhamani","id":"846664538"},"message":"*spices","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-03T05:10:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391352927582530","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Paella i love, but need the peas too...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-03T05:11:24+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391353577582465","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"I love the small Italiano red chilli, pungent but not too hot, loads of flavour...better than our chilli, particularly in a simple clean pasta","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-03T05:13:04+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391353630915793","from":{"name":"Afroza Bhamani","id":"846664538"},"message":"Let me put up the picture of the Paella I ate :-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-03T05:13:15+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391353724249117","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"cool...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-03T05:13:31+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MzkxMzUzNzI0MjQ5MTE3","before":"MzkxMzMwMjk3NTg0Nzkz"}}},"picture":"http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/167402_10150940667404539_1231854905_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10150940667404539\u0026set\u003dgm.391329420918214\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_391057877612035","from":{"name":"Hoor Shah","id":"1545868082"},"message":"Can anyone put up a link to Fuschia\u0027s facebook page?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-02T18:13:30+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-02T21:35:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"582076905","name":"Obaid Sattar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTgyMDc2OTA1","before":"NTgyMDc2OTA1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"391091397608683","from":{"name":"Waqas Tariq","id":"1088744265"},"message":"Here you go: http://bit.ly/KlMwdd","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-02T19:11:32+0000","like_count":12,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391094854275004","from":{"name":"Ahsan R.
