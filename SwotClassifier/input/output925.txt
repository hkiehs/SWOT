The service was prompt, with the staff eager to please. The seating area was a bit warm despite the AC running, probably because of the heat and open area.

They want Mashed potatoes with burgers, Cupcakes with Pistachio frosting, or Hot Dogs with Sausages.  Mr. Joe accommodated us in every which way.\n\nThe food spoke for itself.  From the Philly Cheesesteak, to the Angust Wasabi burger, and to even the HOT DOG- nothing and I mean nothing- was short classed.  We ordered items that weren\u0027t even on the menu- and they were made, done, and absolutely exceptional ON DELIVERY!! \n\nThis is the first day we are too broke to order the Upper Crust, yet we still want to order in.
