Didnt want to go to the usual places so tried the new Breakfast Deals at Cafe Zero Degree.\nWent there around 9 was greeted by the staff and was interested to see quite a few ppl over there(i thought it would have been pretty empty. Was wrong)\nAnyways moving to the menu which to my delight was pretty extensive. We ended up ordered a stuffed chicken omellette with peach lassi, a stuffted cheese one with starwberry lassti for one of the kids, mushroom and chicken creapes with pineapple juice, plus the puries with channay. The stuffed chicken omellete was a delight. Filled with chicken and was spiced to perfection. The lassies were jam packed with flavor the strawberry flavored ones were loved by the kids. And they loved the cheese omellette and creapes. Everything came steaming hot. And service time was great despite the crowd. The best thing we loved was the channa gravy, it wasnt at all oily n was garnished properly. \n\nMy only suggestion to them would be to include cereals as kids love them.\n\nOverall great food, hygenic and relaxing enviroment with good value for money  \nGoing again real soon for sure","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-08T15:29:13+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-08T15:29:13+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"685735173","name":"Zainab Parvez"},{"id":"504972815","name":"Elma Nasir Rehmani"},{"id":"100001028825134","name":"Mujtaba Shah Bukhari"},{"id":"676423132","name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"647220220","name":"Anum Javed Qureshi"},{"id":"730908290","name":"Aymen Jaffry"},{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan"},{"id":"656425117","name":"Mujeeb Ur Rehman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjU2NDI1MTE3","before":"Njg1NzM1MTcz"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_568648633186291","from":{"name":"Patio Pk","id":"100005838280535"},"message":"Brunch at The Patio on Saturdays \u0026 Sundays","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-06-08T15:12:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-08T15:12:48+0000","picture":"http://photos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/t1/1147_131813737023235_688135695_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d131813737023235\u0026set\u003dgm.568648633186291\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_568538903197264","from":{"name":"Rabiya Syed","id":"1453901313"},"message":"Just had the Chapli Kababs from the newly opened dhaaba in Tauheed market and omg they were so good!I dont need to venture out all the way to Shah Faisal any more to have my fix of chapli kababs.The seasoning,the juiciness,proportion of anaar dana and green chillis was just perrrrfect!

Ordered delivered within the committed time. \n3. Every thing delivered was fresh, veggies were scrumptious.\n4. Beef wrap was soft \u0026 juicy.\n5. The dips were delicious specially the one with beef wrap.\n\nIn a nut shell good value for money as the items are quite reasonable, light, low fat \u0026 digestive. Would definitely recommend, specially the diet cautious ones ;)!!!\n\nP.s : Kindly increase the quantity of the dips :D.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-08T09:57:17+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-08T13:30:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001976119853","name":"Nasir Ali"},{"id":"1697150273","name":"Muzaffar Ahmed"},{"id":"705413771","name":"Shayan Abbasy"},{"id":"587107503","name":"Ali Karimjee"},{"id":"511882940","name":"Uzma B"},{"id":"100004993633855","name":"Mahzareen Mama"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100000349262919","name":"Fiza Khuhro"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"1519035319","name":"Ali Fawad"},{"id":"1256236750","name":"Muhammad Saad Khan"},{"id":"510525876","name":"Naeemullah Zafar"},{"id":"268100902","name":"Fahad Aziz"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"529714831","name":"Kanwal Rizwan"},{"id":"572117529","name":"Farman Shams"},{"id":"865695264","name":"Rubina Habib"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODY1Njk1MjY0","before":"MTAwMDAxOTc2MTE5ODUz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"568553503195804","from":{"name":"Rubina Habib","id":"865695264"},"message":"i am a big fan of Eatfit.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-08T09:59:58+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"568561006528387","from":{"name":"Rubina Habib","id":"865695264"},"message":"you order on 35245266","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-08T10:28:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"568575023193652","from":{"name":"Ahsan Khawaja","id":"524740437"},"message":"Maheen Ghauri 7-C, 17th Street, Khayaban-e-Nishat, Phase 6, D.H.A, Karachi, Pakistan-75500","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-08T11:31:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"530150213","name":"Maheen Ghauri","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"568607969857024","from":{"name":"Shehlah Zahir","id":"590227056"},"message":"haha...
