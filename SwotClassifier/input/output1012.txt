But it was not out of this world. I did ask for you (sorry, my bad it was a random plan) but was informed that you aren\u0027t there. Wanted to ask you what to order. Anyways, took and posted pictures, wrote comments and will visit again. The place was neat and clean and your waiters are simply adorable MashaAllah. God bless them...too cute.\n\nThe Upper Crust: Hav Joe, you and your hands have magic dust. The chocolate fro-yo was just divine. Even though I am not a dark chocolate fan...I loved each bite. Any chances of milk chocolate froyo hitting your place anytime soon? TUC is beautifully done up in every sense. The items on display, the little seating area, everything is just too good, warm and welcoming. Menu looked good but we were full from Ampis so opted for just the fro-yo. While we were digesting the yumminess and the silky sexy taste of the cant-believe-this-is-youghrt, Hamid was seen to be attending to each and every single customer...all I could say was \"Awww...\" how sweet..and as if all this was not enough along came a complimentary brownie and I was swept off my feet...and my world turned upside down....my eyes were closed and all I could say was \"mmmm...!\" THIS is now my number 1 favorite brownie...well honestly i don\u0027t even think brownie is the right word for this...I have had brownies but this was love in its purest form, this was the epitome of taste that actually did FULL justice to chocolate - its main ingredient...Im speechless and at the same time I can go on and on. I\u0027ll just end by saying - TUC, you made me forget Salman Khan and Brad Pitt for a second.\n\nEspresso: Company wanted to go there. I didn\u0027t have anything except for a cold drink.\n\nWhat a day. I shall dream of that chocolate heaven now. Sweet dreams SWOT team.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-10T21:52:57+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-11T18:31:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"100000759794024","name":"Ahmed Shahnawaz"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"502247733","name":"Fouzia Oza"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE3NzYwNjU4","before":"MTQ1MzkwMTMxMw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"275659362485221","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"NICE SUMMING UP :) MUST VISIT TUC SOON, MAYB THIS EVENING IF WE CAN.
