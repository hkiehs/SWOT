Oh, fresh orange juice as well!\n\nEverything was spot on. Roughly took 15-20 minutes for serving. The taste slightly on the bland side, simply due to lack of salt.

Went to Olivetto for lunch with all the elves and father Christmas. The kids loved the beautiful christmas tree at the entrance with all its tinsel and ornaments. The warm breadbaskets melted away in our mouths  as soon as they were placed on the table. Then came the starters: salmon with caviar and turkey something pasta. One word guys; DEVINE, just sorry i had to share it with the rest :(  \nOfcourse christmas lunch would be incomplete without turkey. Having eaten turkey many times, I know that its meat can get pretty dry. But not the case today, the turkey slices were moist and perfecto, with yum sides of veges, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and gravy. My son, the rebel, ordered the lamb and had us tukeyites all drooling over his plate as well. Each was attacking the other\u0027s plate. So much for teaching the kids etiquettes of fine dinning.  Just imagine all this with festive holiday music in the background. :) Although we were stuffed to the brim, the creme brule-vanilla, coffee and blueberry floated to our mouths with shortbread pieces of heaven. The little ones enjoyed their brownie with ice cream (thanks Afroze Khan). Oops I didn\u0027t mention the tantalizing drinks. We ordered the sikanjabeen, pina con nada, apple and orange juice and ...my son, the master orderer hit the jackpot with the passion fruit smoothie. I kept snatching his drink, and scolding him for not letting me have a sip or few. Next time he\u0027s ordering for me. Thanks Olivetto for giving us such a wonderful experience. All that was missing was warm apple cider and a fire place. Happy holidays friends!","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-25T14:22:24+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-26T20:10:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1039048992","name":"Camilla Asmatullah"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"100002928478909","name":"Rabia Ahmed"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"508588993","name":"Saroasha Eng"},{"id":"1842333707","name":"Farheen Faroqui"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"617715399","name":"Uzma Javeri"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMDE0NDc1NjIw","before":"MTAzOTA0ODk5Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"284021234982367","from":{"name":"Afroza Bhamani","id":"846664538"},"message":"Thank You Tania!
