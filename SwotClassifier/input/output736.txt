However, i did tell them in a decent tone about their misbeahviour. On the other hand, I understand that some people get annoyed by the attitude of some waiters and they feel that it ruins their mood, but we have to understand that a person could just be having a bad day. While I fully believe that a person should wear a smile and treat those who help pay their salary with respect always, sometimes the stress of life can spill over and they can act in ways they don\u0027t intend. We also need to realize that a waiter does not get paid much even with the amount of tips they receive and on some days they don\u0027t even come away with minimum wage. That\u0027s why i left a good tip for him but i guess. both, the manager and the server were egregious. I wish they could understand how much harm they are causing to their restaurant/outlet and regular customers with their incorrect attitude and behaviour. :( I reckon we should start a training sessions for all the Head managers and after they are trained, they could train their servers/waiters inside the restaurants on how to treat customers and deal with awkward situations !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-22T01:57:08+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]},{"id":"426653550719134","from":{"name":"Faizan Karsaz","id":"542306225"},"message":"Any idea how to report this to the concerned person like the outlet owner or the franchisee ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-22T02:04:12+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"426662110718278","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Am deleting ur irrelevant comments Faizan Karsaz and Umer Hafeez.

Being in client services. Iv had my bad \u0026 worse days too but I never had a choice of even thinking of bringing a sad or frustrated expression on my face, bcoz if u do that once, no matter what, the customer tends to find out there\u0027s something wrong wid u, and we dare not let him do that coz we were always told as cliche that \u0027customer is the king\u0027 and \u0027its because of the customer that we are here\u0027. So we put in our 100% to make him feel royal and majestic, with our treatment, behavior, expressions, tone of voice, gestures, service, etc. We used to take this as seriously as it was intended to be taken.  \n\nI can try and find out as to who the concerned person is for G.A because if these issues aren\u0027t highlighted, we only as customers will be suffering eventually, may be not at G.Affair, but if this practice becomes common and treated with least concern and zero priority, soon we will be victims of vicious service staff everywhere we go.
