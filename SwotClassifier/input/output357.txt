The best thing about this place is that they don’t have uncountable items on their buffet, which just end up causing confusion and I am stuffed by the time I\u0027ve just tasted most of the items. \nHere, you try everything, and then eat to your heart’s content the ones that you like best.\nStarted off with dates and chilled perfect rooh afza, not too sweet not too watery, just right. And then I moved to the buffet table. It started with traditional iftar items; aalu ke pakoray that were light and crispy, not dripping with oil. Qeema samosas, sweet dahi phulki (i fail to understand why people insist on calling them dahi baray instead of phulki. there is anobvious different of size, recipe and taste!), chana chaat and their special “kharadar laal masala aalu”. So delicious, tangy, spicy, well cooked. \nAlong with all this was hummus, ezmeh, tabouleh and their special chutnies, with pita bread. Oh and the fruit salad! Made of fresh fruits, very homely. \n\nNow moving on to the main items. The dinner menu… *sigh* \n\nThere were 4 main courses, one each of chicken, fish, beef and shrimp. The penne arrabiata shrimp was penne pasta tossed with tomato sauce (I’m guessing marinara sauce) and shrimps in generous quantities. The asian crispy beef was so succulent and flavourful!!! It was like a burst of flavors with each mouthful. Chicken green chilli stew was really nicely done, but since I’ve had enough of chicken during my diet I just tasted it and it was good.\n\nThe pièce de résistance of the meal was the spicy mediterranean fish. It was so perfectly cooked, each forkful melted in my mouth like a tiny piece of heaven. The perfect blend of flavors, herbs\u0026 spices; mushroom and olives; and the melt-in0my-mouth fish… Oh god, I want more of it now just thinking about it. I tell you it’s a gift descended from the culinary heavens!\n\nAll this is available with the option of light and fresh garlic rice. I just had a bit of the rice, as I didn’t want to mix the flavors of the main courses with rice and dilute their magic \u003dD\nFor dessert, that day they had caramel custard, which was so creamy it was foodgasm in my mouth! And so nice and chilled, just the way desserts should be. They also had traditional sivaiyaan which was a blend of crispy and soft vermicelli, with balanced sweetness. Dil khush kardia!!\n\nOverall, the entire meal light and delicious, I don’t know how much I ate, but I didn’t get the heavy feeling generally followed by iftar buffets. \nOlivetto has always been great with food, never have they ever disappointed me \u003c3\nSpecial thank you to Afroza Bhamani and her team, for giving us this lovely gem of a place. And double thumbs up for maintaining their quality over the times and especially with something like an iftar buffet. At most places, iftar buffets usually don\u0027t have the same standards as a la carte menus.\n\nI came home full and happy, with no regrets of cheating on my diet \u003c3","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-26T19:41:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-27T16:01:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"538934895","name":"Amad Ul Hasan Siddiqui"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"562582174","name":"Sarah Ahmed"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"644815164","name":"Ahsan Pervez"},{"id":"646070570","name":"Murtaza Kasmani"},{"id":"509280017","name":"Jamil Rahman"},{"id":"500846017","name":"Sheharyar Mujahid"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"501834092","name":"Fawaz Khan"},{"id":"100000579313166","name":"Xobi Shah"},{"id":"750730596","name":"Rabiea Jameel"},{"id":"1544452028","name":"Sana Wasif"},{"id":"661185719","name":"Aamir Alvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjYxMTg1NzE5","before":"NTM4OTM0ODk1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"593039774080510","from":{"name":"Ayesha Shaukat","id":"503984035"},"message":"N here I thought u were studying for ur mid terms b!
