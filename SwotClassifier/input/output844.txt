The crispy beef and chicken Manchurian were not bad, not great or out of this world or anything but decent enough to order again when you have a craving for Chinese. I felt that there was a bit too much sugar in both, it works with the chopsuey but wished there was less sugar in the Manchurian and crispy beef. \n\nAll in all Golden Dragon hits the spot when your craving Chinese food on those weekend movie marathon nights where food isn\u0027t the main focus of the evening. Not fine dining or anything but a pleasant experience none the less.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-20T17:53:33+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-21T00:42:22+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"529620428","name":"Roomana Nasir"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NTI5NjIwNDI4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"401131709937985","from":{"name":"Zainab Mansoor","id":"548006350"},"message":"Qamarunnisa Asim","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T17:57:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","type":"user","offset":0,"length":16}]},{"id":"401132456604577","from":{"name":"Umme Hamdani","id":"592813967"},"message":"Good desi chinese, not too heavy on the pocket.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T17:58:41+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401133369937819","from":{"name":"Omar Omari","id":"508277151"},"message":"Exactly my sentiments umme but I think u said it better!! :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T18:01:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401136446604178","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Omar Omari:Thank you for taking out time and writing such a lovely review :) Will definitely look into the prawn ball complain...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T18:08:51+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"508277151","name":"Omar Omari","type":"user","offset":0,"length":10}]},{"id":"401138686603954","from":{"name":"Omar Omari","id":"508277151"},"message":":) always enjoy golden dragon night","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T18:14:20+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401207186597104","from":{"name":"Fahim Bilwani","id":"686445178"},"message":"Can u send golden dragon no ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T20:30:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401207759930380","from":{"name":"Mehreen Obaid","id":"10403487"},"message":"I had a similar experience yesterday, got the vegetable chopsuey and hot and spicy chicken, the chopsuey was excellent , while the chicken a little on the chilli garlic ketchupy  side but all in all bang for the buck and decent Chinese for a night in !
