The food was amazing! We ordered, Chicken Florentine, Batter Fried Fish and Fries, and Chicken Moroccon! Everyone loved their entree\u0027s! The chicken Florentine was delicious, but not as spicy as I was led to believe! The stuffing in it amazing, with the sauce serving being very generous! \n\nMoroccon was deliciously juicy and soft! And if my dad says that the fish is good, then the damn fish must be reallly good! \n\nThe owner was very nice and courteous and kept checking up on us and on the other guests as well! But what was really annoying was the NOISE! I mean the ambiance was very intimate and soft, but the level of noise was so disturbing! We could hardly enjoy ourselves cause of it! \n\nBut at least the food was delicious!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-13T19:57:09+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-13T22:59:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"1594359576","name":"Navaid Sagheer"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTU5NDM1OTU3Ng\u003d\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"618353534882467","from":{"name":"Ghausia Rashid Salam","id":"716901426"},"message":"Ohhhh.
