Two thumbs up as usual! Though Aali Qayoom felt the Chili Con Carne should carry a serving of Doritos which it presently does not. Sohail had the Gourmet Classic Mushroom Burger and was completely enamored of it! It was certainly love at first bite! It’s easy to see why. There’s a genuinely healthy beef pattie inside and makes for large and juicy morsels. Believe me size matters when you’re hungry! Too often we get a bun wherein there is a faint hint of a pattie, and the french fries are limp and soggy. But the French fries that accompanied the Gourmet Classic Mushroom Burger were crisp and thick, and of good size. \n\nFinally there was the Gourmet Italian Grilled Chicken Burger that I had ordered for myself. Aali had taken a generous mouthful of the Gourmet Classic Mushroom Burger with the beef pattie, and said the chicken pattie in the Gourmet Italian Grilled Chicken Burger was a bit insipid after that. Tasted fine to me, and man was I hungry after an extended session with spiked grape fruit juice! As far as I am concerned GBC passed the test with flying colours, and this not based on the meal I had tonight. Last night I had ordered the Gourmet Classic Burger that professed to be prime ground beef flame grilled to perfection. It went down just fine, and my tummy coped quite well, and my morning interface with Nature was quite pleasant! The reason I mention this aspect is because up-market Karachi food is prone to hit the wrong chords with me more often than I care for. GBC food and I are entering a comfort zone. Well done chaps!","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-10T20:58:37+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-10T21:56:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NTIxOTA4NDU0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"275406335843857","from":{"name":"Adil Ahmad","id":"1183115625"},"message":"Aali Qayoom Tag this on to Sohail.
