The iftar items comprised of spring rolls, pakoras, singaporean samosas, prawn tempura, sandwiches, mini burgers, fruit chaat and chollah. All fresh and yummy. we were then asked by the waiter if we would like to have shikanjbeen which was also on the house and it was very refreshing. Then we proceeded again to the buffet table for our dinner, the dishes were moroccan chicken, garlic rice, beef pepper steaks, sauteed vegetables, shashlik, seekh kebab, yakhni pukao, chicken cream crepe, penne arabitta, red snapper. and u wont believe it was simply awesome... very rare u get to eat at a buffet where all the dishes are equally gud and u cant decide which to opt for second helping. When we returned to our table we were again asked if we would like to try their mint cooler (mint lemonade) which was again on the house. The desserts were mini cheese cake, mini chocolate fudge cake and eclairs. ALL THIS IN JUST 999+tax which came upto 1183 per head.\nThe most commendable was the way we served, the staff was very very courteous and efficient. i have not seen such a civilized buffet in ages. and yes on our way out a professional photographer was there to take out pic which i received on my email, a true cheery on top.
