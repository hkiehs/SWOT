Prompt delivery via Urbanite with great packaging – all components packed separately, labeled and wrapped in plastic to prevent spillage. \nLoved the Mandalay Chazan – loved the balance of flavors, and the vermicelli noodles with mushroom gravy made it taste so much different from the typical Khaw Suey. The Ohn no Khauk Suey was similar to Karachi style Khaw suey but served better than other eateries. Loved the fragnant rice with the Beef Rendang, but can\u0027t comment on the taste since I rarely eat this style of beef. My little brother liked it and compared it to a ‘Bhuna wa Salaan’ with Asian flavors. \nOverall – great food and a much needed change from the typical eateries opening in Karachi. I do wish they would add more items on the menu which are not from Burma (Pad Thai \u0026 Pho).","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-11-16T14:17:43+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-16T14:17:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"689541666","name":"Hira Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg5NTQxNjY2","before":"NzQ5MjA0NTUy"}}},"picture":"http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/t1/1472941_10151709895600443_1461164713_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10151709895600443\u0026set\u003dgm.651702451547575\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_651650401552780","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Went to Rowtisserie last night with friends...ordered their deal for four..food was great, service was top notch and diet coke in a can was a delight and a half...the best place to have healthy meal...with Saba Hussain Sajjad Syed and Fizza Saleem...","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-16T12:02:57+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-16T12:07:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100004078952313","name":"Shazia Asghar"},{"id":"759755386","name":"Hasnain Marvi"},{"id":"792915494","name":"Ahmad Fayyaz Ali"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"100001193436822","name":"Saad Baig"},{"id":"1644192030","name":"Faisal Laghari"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQwNjE5NTEw","before":"NTY0OTg1NDgy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"651651421552678","from":{"name":"Fareha Zarsheen","id":"612250309"},"message":"I second that.

The sambhar is made with the sambhar masala u get from india I think some stores here might have it like aghas and ebco or maybe farids but I doubt that. For coconut chutney, you have to have fine and fresh grated coconut, yogurt, chana daal and you have to roast it a bit and crush it. Once the daal is crushed keep it aside. Add yogurt, coconut, garlic,green chillies and salt into a blender and grind away then pour the mixture in a bowl mix the crushed and roasted daal ( needs to be fine but not in a powder form) then just heat some oil in a pan and put in some rai and curry leaves and pour the tarka on the chutney. If you are looking for a ready made stuff then try looking for gits dosa pack here in aghas other than that I highly doubt if you get anything ready made to create a great dosa.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-15T20:38:16+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjUxMzU4NTMxNTgxOTY3","before":"NjUxMDk0MDY4Mjc1MDgw"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_651250104926143","from":{"name":"Sadia Shamsi","id":"760385250"},"message":"From where can I get yummmy chicken qorma and sheermal","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-15T17:57:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-15T20:31:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1475984626","name":"Shoaib Mohammad Quraishi"},{"id":"1127801684","name":"Muhammad Shahbaz"},{"id":"500650902","name":"Kamran Zia"},{"id":"780560073","name":"Anita Zeeshan Al-Najjar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzgwNTYwMDcz","before":"MTQ3NTk4NDYyNg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"651277788256708","from":{"name":"Sara Kazmi","id":"100001822097920"},"message":"sheermal u can get it frm Indus Food :]","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-15T18:36:03+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"651279031589917","from":{"name":"Sadaf Hayat Naqvi","id":"563272024"},"message":"Shadi hall","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-15T18:39:34+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"651279168256570","from":{"name":"Shaheer Hassan","id":"556911379"},"message":"Ancholi Imam bargah tonight","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-15T18:40:00+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"651288378255649","from":{"name":"Khadija Javed Khan","id":"505485667"},"message":"Chaudry Mateen","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-15T19:02:07+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"651291248255362","from":{"name":"Sameen Shahid","id":"746376004"},"message":"Indus qorma is just avg but their sheermal good\n\n..
