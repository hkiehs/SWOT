Take him to Waheed or Shaikh Abdul Ghaffar for excellent barbecue (dhaga kabab, kabab fry, nihari, reshmi kababs etc.) otherwise BBQ tonite or food centre. Visit tandoori hut for makhni handi, kolachi for paneer reshmi and Peshawari karahi, Cafe lazeez for katakat ( you can go for noorani kabab as well for katakat). For seafood, biryani of the seas. Try mutton leg and desi dishes at kaiser restaurant. Karachi haleem, javed nihari, sabri nihari are also with trying but do let him know that he can\u0027t get Lahore type nihari here. Remember, he can\u0027t have good rolls in Lahore so take him to royals at Sindhi Muslim for chicken chatni and mayo garlic rolls, hot n spicy for chicken malai boti roll, red apple (Clifton) for chicken Bihari roll, roll-inn for zinger type crispy roll. For chapli kababs, Shah faisal colony or log inn lounge. Bunkebab tou sirf Pakistan chowk kay. After all these meals, ab kuch meetha hujaiye, Fresco ki mithai aur jalebi aur dahi mongi (samosay too), dilpasand aur rehmat-e-shireen ka gajar halwa, shikarpuri \u0026 BBQ tonite ki kulfi (iceberg crunch kulfi a must try), burns road ki rabri.
