I was deeply and madly in love with shezan surprise of \u0027Shezan\u0027 since I was a small girl, but today at around 3, I went to shezan near metropole with my brother and his wife. They ordered club sandwich and BBQ platter and I ordered my favourite glass of icecream which I was going to eat after about a year or so and I was really excited for it although my brother said tht it is not worth almost 350 Rs. To have an icecream. When the glass came, instead of the tall glass with three scoops of icecream which I was expecting, there came a wine glass with two scoops and the BBQ platter tht came costing almost the same was so limited in quantity tht when we were leaving the restaurant after paying 1200 something Rupees, we were not at all satisfied. I am not a food critic or anything but just a customer, maybe I was expecting too much but one thing is for sure tht Shezan has lost one of its fan although the sandwich and platter was good in taste but the quantity was not worth the price.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-07T14:19:23+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-08T10:52:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5NDIyOTQ0","before":"NjE5MjM1ODcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"374589989258824","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Bang bang Ahmed shahnawaz","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-07T15:18:46+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"374592942591862","from":{"name":"Syed Adeel Ahmed","id":"635540096"},"message":"its not bang sir, Bounce is the magic word now","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-07T15:24:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"374607472590409","from":{"name":"Saira Qadri","id":"609681937"},"message":"customer came to shezan with a bang and out with a bounce....:s","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-07T15:52:50+0000","like_count":10,"user_likes":false},{"id":"374675935916896","from":{"name":"Sadiyah Ahmed","id":"826050057"},"message":"Where is the bouncing ball when you need him lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-07T17:58:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"374805542570602","from":{"name":"Waqas Tariq","id":"1088744265"},"message":"Ahmed Shahnawaz your needed here!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-07T21:59:48+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100000759794024","name":"Ahmed Shahnawaz","type":"user","offset":0,"length":15}]},{"id":"374810215903468","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Rafia, knowing Ahmed Bhai and his generosity, I am sure he will give you a drum of the Shezan surprise (on the house) to make it up to you.\n\nRemember to share it, when you get it :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-07T22:09:03+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"374926779225145","from":{"name":"Rafia Abid","id":"847285573"},"message":"That is not my point .....

There was another group that had walked in at the same time but was talking to some people seated at another table whom the waiter insisted on giving the table to. The point is that people who are the first to request should be waited upon first. And the service staff should not be cheeky as was the case.\n\n We were seated outside where no one gave a menu for ages. When we were shifted inside later the attitude of the waiters remained a mix of arrogance. \u0026  cheeky. \n\nFood is not the only thing that makes the place....
