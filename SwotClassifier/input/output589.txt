We were late for a movie so couldn\u0027t stop by at the chullo kabab place near lucky star and decided to have a quick dinner from the food court. While my friend\u0027s opted for mc donalds, i thought of trying something different. I\u0027ve had their sweet crepes tons of times at the khadda market outlet. This was the first time i was going for a savoury crepe. Ordered the mexican crepe.\nThe guy making the crepe neither had any plastic gloves on and nor did he have any proper utensils.\nWhile preparing the filling for my crepe he took out a few plastic jars out of the fridge consisting of jalapenos, mushrooms and corn. At first he tried to take this stuff out of the jar using a plastic fork, but when he realized its not helping him much he decided to stuff his bare hands in the jars and take out a handful of each of these ingredients onto the cutting board. He used what he needed and then put the remaining back in the jar. I even interrupted him and inquired why he wasn\u0027t using a spoon, but all i got back was a smile!\nDon\u0027t know about the taste because i definitely didn\u0027t eat it. But in terms of hygiene i\u0027d give them a ZERO.

Was just curious if the management had been told about the problems and whether they had responded. Aman Virji is on SWOT so I am sure he will take notice. The issue is that if people don\u0027t point it out to the restaurant at that time, there is no chance for them to have a meal that they can actually enjoy ... and if the restaurant management is not on SWOT, they will never know or get the chance to fix the issues being highlighted. For me, comments on SWOT are greatly informative for food lovers like us ... however, it is also good if the message gets directly to the restaurant management at the time the customer is there so specific information can be given about the problems. And then, one can know if anything is being done in the short/long term to rectify the highlighted issues. I know everyone wants good options with respect to restaurants and if we provide useful, timely feedback ... maybe some of these problems can be addressed effectively.

So called GinSoy for a reservation for 2..... They were booked so called up China Kitchen instead and at 8:30 met Mahvash Siddiqi Khan there. Since just two offs and we are both adventurous we thought hmmmm lets have the duck. So with that one beef ribs ( yes I can\u0027t go there and NOT eat those) and one crispy beef.  The food as always was amazing. Loved the duck thu not the hoisin so took Ghazala Mijnhart advise and added some of the hot savoury sauces provided on the table.

It was phenomenal everyone loved it I think it\u0027s a must try!!!! It looks like a cake but of course it\u0027s not....This sandwich loaf is served cold and I am posting the pic below! \nWe also ordered her \u0027chola chaat/dahi papri\u0027 and I believe she makes all the \u0027chutneys\u0027 on her own and needs a day in advance notice for this order!!!
