Recommend Mao Kung Pao Chicken, Mao Orange Chicken, Mao Beef in Black Bean Sauce and Mao Szechwan Spicy Chicken from their New Chinese Menu.  In case you wanna order Thai, their New Dish \"Mao Red Curry\" is a must try and it goes great with Jasmine Rice.  All time favorites are Thai Beef in Oyster Sauce, Stir Fried Chicken with Roasted Cashews, Chicken with Cashew Nuts, Chicken in Tamarind Sauce, Beef with Garlic and Pepper, Crispy Fish and Spicy Thai Fried Noodles.  All dishes go very well with Steamed Jasmine Rice. And while you are ordering from Chairman Mao, I\u0027d highly recommend you order their Gelato, my favorite flavors being Chocolate, Coffee, Ferrero and Mint Chocolate Chip.  Btw, I also love their Japanese menu and find their Sushi to be better than what is served at Sakura and Fujiyama.
