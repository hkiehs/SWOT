Enough said!\n\nTutti fruti Froyo: I love the fact that they keep bringing in new flavors every week. So far, my favourites have been lychee and peach\nBreakfast at Xanders: Tried their soft scrambled eggs, Xanders Club Sandwich, berry daiquiri and strawberry smoothie…absolutely loved the sandwich! I just wish they had pizza in the mornings too. I can have their pizza at all times of the day!\n\nKolachi:  Had heard alot about their makhani handi…taste was alright but left me feeling too heavy…could not have more than a few bites. I really liked the nachos there! The service there deserves special mention. I would definitely go there again.\n\nA One Rolls: Though I used to love the rolls there as compared to eaton, hot and spicy and other roll places, the past couple of times when I went there, the rolls were soggy and extremely oily. \n\nCup a Soup Chicken Laksa at Aghas: I was very hungry (starving actually lol) when I had it and really liked the lemony coconut soup. Would have preferred if it was just a tiny bit more on the sour side as that is the way I’ve had it in Malaysia. A little more punch can make it really Wow! Btw I tried to make it my way at home the next day (just added a little extra imlee ka pani) and it was fabulous!\n\nButlers for lunch today:  Turkey Club Sandwich was good to taste…however, it was falling apart and not too easy to manage. I did not try the spicy chicken sandwich and Butlers Club Sandwich but my friends seemed satisfied with them. The chocolate decadence and hazelnut dessert (oops forgot the name but the dessert itself was pretty forgettable :S!) were fine. I guess I wasn’t in the mood for sweets. \n\nOh I also attended a dinner event at Marriot. Why oh why does the food at 5star hotels have to be so bland????Loved the potato gratin though..just the right amount of cheese and garlic butter..yum!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-09T19:02:29+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-10T09:54:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"753461179","name":"Rohia Zohaib"},{"id":"682241004","name":"Atif Malik"},{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid"},{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"589485566","name":"Murwah Tariq-Atif"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"757449744","name":"Syed Sabih Abbas Razvi"},{"id":"828190023","name":"Shaheen Nouman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODI4MTkwMDIz","before":"NTUyMDA2MTU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"395602850490871","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"\u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T09:54:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzk1NjAyODUwNDkwODcx","before":"Mzk1NjAyODUwNDkwODcx"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_395601420491014","from":{"name":"Fahad Humayun","id":"756755028"},"message":"XANDER\u0027s - Major disappointment.

I ordered a box of walnut brownies and an AfterEight Cake.\nThe brownies were superyumm! not just me but my whole family and specially my mum (a good critic) loved \u0027em ! Perfect fudginess and gooeness inside with slight crisp on the outside.\nAfter Cyra Anklesaria , Taha Zoeb has done it ! Honestly I am really impressed :)\n\nThe Aftereight cake was also very well done! i am a chocomint lover and he does it very well !\nRatan Salem you are a wonderful mum, supporting your kids and helping them establish at such a young age!\nThumbs UP Taha ! Keep it up :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-07T11:28:32+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-10T00:02:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"595246064","name":"Sukaina Fayyaz"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"268100919","name":"Ibaad Lari"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"100001973577700","name":"Saad Asim"},{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"100000165965092","name":"Sonia Amjad"},{"id":"547029950","name":"Farva Shah"},{"id":"1288336373","name":"Muffi Halai"},{"id":"681799779","name":"Ratan Salem"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjgxNzk5Nzc5","before":"NTk1MjQ2MDY0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"394054213979068","from":{"name":"Ratan Salem","id":"681799779"},"message":"Super Like this !!!! :-)) Hoor Shah, this is a wondeful review.
