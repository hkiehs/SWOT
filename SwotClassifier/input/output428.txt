Then came Broadway pizza and my infatuation with NYP ended on a very abrupt note. Didn\u0027t get a chance to say goodbyes and pay my final respects. Broadway changed my perspective towards Newyork style brick oven pizzas. Today when I ordered BP, I was real hungry and inquisitive probably because my breakup with NYP was fresh and BP was expected to be soon on my door step. Ding dong and there it was ......fresh out of oven, neatly placed in a printed box and ready to be served ..... i found BP way too delicious. Crisped to perfection, heavenly sauces and plenty of meat to finish up a complete package. It came with its side kick (a heavy side order of tikka stix) which was equally good. All in all broadway pizza has earned 9.75/10 in my humble gluttonian view and highly recommended for connosieurs of good NY style pizza ......","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-04T17:15:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-04T18:24:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"712751198","name":"Zareen Sultan"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"509910007","name":"Ahmed Affan"},{"id":"750380542","name":"Hina Shah"},{"id":"1296036496","name":"Saud Younus"},{"id":"576449828","name":"Danish Ayub"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"509568517","name":"Beenish Ehsan"},{"id":"783958571","name":"Rabia Rajput"},{"id":"100002698452985","name":"Rabia Mahmood"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"},{"id":"787375286","name":"Zain Rauf"},{"id":"100002989785243","name":"Mareah M.

Its the best thing which could happen to Karachi far BETTER THAN Hardees with almost the same replica leaving the bun every thing is same ... I tried FATBOY burger with a 3 patty fillet ,  cheese, onions \u0026 jalapeno thou I had to open my mouth real wide to eat it the taste was AMAZING... the first punch you get is of the grilled patty and then followed by a rich taste of their sauce when combined you get a rich flavor to die for, and its followed by those lovely onions its just (*\u0026$  Although the patty was a bit undercooked but the taste was still outstanding \nThe chips you have to eat as soon as you can I would rate their chips on a scale of 1 to 10 , 4 It is very sweet and not that crisp as it should be could have been better if its cooked for a little more time...\nMy home minster got the grilled chicken burger and I was in awe that I should have ordered that , very manageable and tasty  well cooked patty and good mix of sauce with onion tomato and cheese ... The chicken patty just feels right in your mouth its not hard nor soft and you enjoy your burger till you are chewing on your bite.. One thing to note when you go there is ensure you get a takeaway NOT eat there as the environment is hot and un bearable ..\nThe kiddo got himself a chicken grilled steak burger and then again I was hey kid leave me a bite alone LOL... I did not taste it but I know for a fact that my son enjoyed it alot because it\u0027s the only burger he finishes which I am sure is a sign he likes it.. \n I was lucky to enjoy it with my fav show at home with my family...  enjoyed their burgers like anything if you happen to be in the neighborhood towards Badhurabad its a MUST TRY!!!! I would any time have Sumy\u0027s burger than HARDEES due to its taste and being very reasonable in price...","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-03T06:23:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-04T18:05:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"673567501","name":"Haris Hassan"},{"id":"100002850760185","name":"Nayab Ali"},{"id":"657151302","name":"Nishat Mustafa"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"100004861441059","name":"Ifrah Hameed"},{"id":"502158910","name":"Mujtaba Karim"},{"id":"838135166","name":"Sadia Akbani"},{"id":"575820034","name":"Maheen Kamran"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTc1ODIwMDM0","before":"NjczNTY3NTAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"579845082066646","from":{"name":"Ahmed Affan","id":"509910007"},"message":"directions to Sumy\u0027s please.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-03T07:33:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579845888733232","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Karim","id":"502158910"},"message":"Hillside Bldg, Bahadurabad, Karachi, Pakistan-75400","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-03T07:36:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579846055399882","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Karim","id":"502158910"},"message":"Page https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sumys-broast-and-burgers/168816466494140","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-03T07:37:03+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579846175399870","from":{"name":"Ahmed Affan","id":"509910007"},"message":"thanks a lot Mujtaba \u003d)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-03T07:37:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"502158910","name":"Mujtaba","type":"user","offset":13,"length":7}]},{"id":"579851978732623","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Karim","id":"502158910"},"message":"Yeah man :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-03T07:50:48+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579853268732494","from":{"name":"Ifrah Hameed","id":"100004861441059"},"message":"Lol, home minister. \nBurhani sure gives you the de ja vu feeling.
