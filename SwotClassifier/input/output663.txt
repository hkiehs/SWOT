So I did point this out, and everything from the soup to the sweet and sour prawns were just perfect. What I love about them is that they listen to everything. Whether its praise or a complaint. \n\nFood order:-\n1) hot and sour soup\n2) sweet and sour prawns\n3) beef chilie dry,\n4) pad Thai noodles,\n5) steamed wontons in spicy red sauce\n6) vegetable egg fried rice \n7) chicken Chopseuy (sent complimentary - one of my fav items, last time was bland and starchy....this time amazing)\n\nTruely GOLDENIZED to the core. Even thu I ate the food lunch and dinner the next day.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-09T16:36:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-10T09:04:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"800134590","name":"Erum Babar"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"603100292","name":"Abbas Bootwala"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"888075011","name":"Nayyer Rauf"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"513439271","name":"Sabiha Ghani"},{"id":"100000087144502","name":"Nadia Nadeem"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI1OTY4OTUz","before":"ODAwMTM0NTkw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"485655414818947","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Thank you Nezihe!!!
