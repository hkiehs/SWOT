I ordered 6 chicken strips and 2 mozzarella cheese sticks and CHOSE 8 sauces to go with these since the menu uploaded on KarachiSnob clearly stated that “Each side order includes one of the following sauces of your choice”. I had also ordered one regular fries separately and one California Mushroom Cheese Burger. While placing the order I asked for all the amounts separately for each item and the agent told me the prices accordingly and then gave me the grand total of 3723/-. \nAfter placing the order and receiving the order number,I kept the phone down and calculated again. The actual amount including tax was coming out to 3155/- . I figured that the agent had charged me for the 8 sauces WITH taxes giving me the price difference of Rs.600 (ish).\n\nI had placed my order at 1.11pm and called them back at 1.21. I gave my order number and asked why I was charged for the sauces when the menu clearly states that I have to choose one. The gentleman at the other end, first stated that “now the order has been punched in” and “aap ne alag se punch karawaya hoga”. (Why exactly would I do that!)\n\n(Also of great notice is the fact, that whilst placing the order initially when I said I wanted to order 6 chicken strips, the agent said “Ma’am is pe tou chicken strips show ni horahay, beef bacon strips hain”. I told the agent to check again. After 2 minutes, I got the eureka expression from him saying that he had found chicken strips! )\n\nSo when I called at 1.20, and demanding an explanation while the gentleman kept taking me in round abouts and putting me on hold thrice, taking the time to 1.30pm, said “But now your order time has gone up to 20 minutes and I’ll forward this to the department”. \n\nGetting a red signal from my colleagues, who were hungry including myself, I cancelled the order, and my cancellation was accepted.\nWe ordered from GBC.\n\nI then received a call from a very nice lady from the customer representative department, who was kind enough to hear me out and agree with the mistake at their end and regretted that this had happened. Needless to say, I will order from BTB again purely from their food BUT lesson learned! Check the calculations while on the phone to avoid such instances!

First of all I would like to appologise for the bad experience you had while ordering and the mistake made by our in-bound telemarketing agent has been taken very seriously. The agent is new and has been given a final warning especially when we do quite a bit of role playing during our training sessions. The order was ready when it was cancelled but I would have done the same had I been in the same situation. Trust me,  I am determined to ensure superior quality of food and quality of service and that is why every customer who orders receives a courtesy call from our customer service department and I look at each feedback personally. In future, if you have any issue what so ever, you may directly call my Customer Service Manager Mr. Shehzad at 0345-8883510. I personally tired calling to appologize but the line got disconnected. I would like to make it up by offering 20% discount on you (Ms. Nida) on your next order. Kindly place your order directly with my Customer Service Manager Mr. Shehzad at 0345-8883510.
