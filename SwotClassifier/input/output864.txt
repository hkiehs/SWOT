Many an accomplished baker has tried, and tried again to perfect this innocent looking British/ Scottish bread. Although I do not consider myself an accomplished baker from anywhere, I too thought I could \u0027make it at home for nothing\u0027, needless to say it was a sad sad day in the kitchen.  \n\nComing back to the ones I ordered today, the scones themselves were pretty close to the real thing; buttery, feather-light and crumbly. Although I felt they hadn\u0027t risen enough, (the picture on the fb page will tell you that), they look quite flat although the ones I ordered had a bit more height on them. Still, they tasted great and hit the spot.\n\nHad to settle for double cream instead of clotted cream and although I was initially disappointed when I heard that, it turned out to be an acceptable substitute. \n\nNow for the sad part, I come from a house hold where Jam is taken very seriously. Buying jam/ jelly from the market is a sin. The jam that accompanied the scones was not home made and would have ruined them, thankfully my kitchen is always well stocked with seasonal/ non seasonal jams all year round. Strawberry jam to the rescue. \n\nAll in all for those who are sick to death of the trillions of places offering cupcakes camouflaged with mountains of sickeningly sweet icing, the scones at Mad Hatters Tea Room are a savior. Pure and wholesome. A perfect example of less is more.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-10T15:18:34+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-11T10:14:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"585622689","name":"Naveed Ismail"},{"id":"504176735","name":"Ali Farookh Rizvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA0MTc2NzM1","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"395712810479875","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"That\u0027s it?

(Remind me to remind you not to add nuts to my brownies next time) I liked how they gave a milk chocolate plus dark chocolate taste to the tastebuds....It was awesome-mondo. 10/10 and 5 stars: *****\n\nChocolate ganache cupcakes: NOW that\u0027s a winner!! THIS is what cupcakes should boast about. Excellent soft moist perfectly cooked base, and the ganache was spectacular! You get 11/10 for this Taha! ***** \u003c-- 5 stars too :)\n\nAll the best for the future, I know you will get better and better with time! Will order again soon coz I am a sucker for things that are GREAT value for money along with taste - 850 bucks only for 12 brownies and 12 cupcakes, I am most definitely a frequent customer :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-10T18:25:03+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-10T21:15:12+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"681799779","name":"Ratan Salem"},{"id":"723085405","name":"Taha Zoeb"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"100000093496883","name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"764425006","name":"Alisa Zulfiqar Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzY0NDI1MDA2","before":"NjgxNzk5Nzc5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"395834177134405","from":{"name":"Taha Zoeb","id":"723085405"},"message":"Thank you so much Ms Hajra Amir.
