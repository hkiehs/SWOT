I was very pleased with the sushi experience. This is not my first encounter with sushi but definitely my first time in Karachi. Since I was a newbie, my friend basically ordered everything and I just went with the flow. We ordered the steamed prawn dumplings, the beef dish called Negimiyaki and the main platter which was the Moriwase. Firstly, we started off with the Nama Yasai, which is the fresh vegetable salad drizzled with their special Fujiyama sauce. It was a nice light salad and the sauce was delicious. Secondly, we moved on to the steamed dumplings, my first bite into it, I was in love! The sauce and the flavor of the dumplings, just hit the right spot. My taste buds were definitely having a party! Next was the the Negimiyaki, oh my! I thoroughly enjoyed the beef styled sushi stuffed with spring onions. They were a tough one to chew through as a whole but the beef was very flavorful served with excellent teriyaki sauce. Next came the Moriwase platter which was an assortment of sushi (salmon, tuna, crab, prawn). I was skeptical when I first saw the platter thinking whether I would be able to digest this beautifully crafted food of art. I didn\u0027t waste any time and dived into it, it was quite an adrenaline rush! I enjoyed eating every piece and had them dripping with sauce. I added a dash of wasabi to the soy sauce and it still gave a strong bite to it. Every piece was well balanced with perfectly cooked rice served at the right temperature. The fish itself was bursting with flavor, with the balance favoring more fish than rice. The weather was lovely today, and I enjoyed the view from the rooftop which made the whole experience even more enjoyable. I ended the experience with green tea and it felt just right. I am so impressed that Karachi has such an excellent Japanese restaurant.  Service was prompt and friendly.  I will definitely be coming here again and again!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-02T20:12:10+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-03T07:34:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"732665092","name":"Mariam Bandukda"},{"id":"576301855","name":"Kashif Dadwani"},{"id":"502191902","name":"Zaigham Hidayatullah"},{"id":"603103229","name":"Danish Munir"},{"id":"521420389","name":"Syed Jami Amin"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"854755191","name":"Suhana Sami"},{"id":"693205243","name":"Madiha Saeed Patel"},{"id":"785615314","name":"Maleeha Jawaid"},{"id":"731377379","name":"Shahzad Pirwani"},{"id":"539982540","name":"Arfa Abid"},{"id":"500616229","name":"Sama Aman"},{"id":"657151302","name":"Nishat Mustafa"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"1241494164","name":"Dania Obaid-Naseem"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"527881636","name":"Marina Khan"},{"id":"509568517","name":"Beenish Ehsan"},{"id":"514292991","name":"Marium Hosein"},{"id":"692390995","name":"Wahaj M Khan"},{"id":"1257283317","name":"Aymun Zafar"},{"id":"512612823","name":"Leena Faruqui"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzQ5MTE0NTE0","before":"MTU0MjY2OTM5Mg\u003d\u003d"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_579638998753921/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dMTAwMDAwNzQ5MTE0NTE0"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"579639108753910","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"fuji is my all time fav japanese place. :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-02T20:12:44+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579639345420553","from":{"name":"Zeeshan Rasool","id":"100000095643451"},"message":"gonna c/p this so I can remember the name of the dishes when I go next :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-02T20:13:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579642592086895","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Zeeshan...next time you go there ask for Badar...he\u0027s very helpful and will recommend you what you like... :-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-02T20:22:38+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579642762086878","from":{"name":"Zeeshan Rasool","id":"100000095643451"},"message":"Will do :) thanks for the tip","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-02T20:23:14+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579643355420152","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":":-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-02T20:25:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579656395418848","from":{"name":"Hanya Javaid","id":"1090005239"},"message":"i didnt like the taste of fuji yama\u0027s food...

We ordered the hot and sour soup and the tom yum soup. Hot and sour was good, i think they took the hot a bit too literally it was a bit too spicy! but we all enjoyed it. I didnt try the other one but whoever had it liked it. For starters we ordered prawn toast and i kid you not it took them over an hour to serve us that. But it was worth teh wait. For the main course we let the waiter decide for us as we were clueless. Ended up ordering dry beef chili which was pretty good, american chop suey - i think we all liked that out of all the other dishes we ordered. The emperor chicken which was highly recommended by the waiter was chicken manchurian. Yes, the ketchup-y sort. Kung pao chicken which wasnt amazing but edible. Vegetable fried rice and garlic rice both were good! All in all it was a good experience i\u0027d give it a 7/10.
