I went. Bang on service, anticipatory service... (read attentive and watchful). Starters, I left to Aman Virji. Trio of seafood. Juicy shrimps in a spicy fresh dip, sea bream and smoked salmon. Very very good. The Vietnamese roll was fresh, crunchy, peanuty, spicy and brilliant. The mango prawn salad. The birds eye chilli wafer thin slices hit the perfect high notes. \n\nMy chocolate steak. Very good, but I really only like American steaks, the cut does nothing for me. The wok fried oriental chicken is a must have. The tamarind fish... brill. The pasta 44 was the best of the best. Fish batter was a bit bouncy. But forgiveable.\n\n44 in a nutshell is a very refined place for sophisticated and learning palates. It does stand alone and is an unrecognised under dog who can punch with the best. Service is brilliant, but heck, they new I was coming and rolled out a red and gilt edged carpet for me. I had a great time. 44 is not cheap, but on every plate you know the quality shows they do not skimp. Lastly.... if you have one thing.... Try the 44 house pasta, brilliant. Aman Virji, you lived up to my expectations, thanks for the royal treatment.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-10T19:01:28+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-13T08:37:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"590248896","name":"Naveed Seraj"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100001432075867","name":"Suhaila Tobeh"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"764425006","name":"Alisa Zulfiqar Zuberi"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"500616229","name":"Sama Aman"},{"id":"60501814","name":"Shezray Husain-Hasan"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"809891464","name":"Julie Haris"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"100000759794024","name":"Ahmed Shahnawaz"},{"id":"603490700","name":"Mariam Bilgrami"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAzNDkwNzAw","before":"NTkwMjQ4ODk2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"395819010469255","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"The menu is fresh....

The chilli garlic prawn was exactly how it sounded, safe and boring, I ordered it in case all else failed with the starters..I had to search around for the prawns..wasn\u0027t too impressed with the portions. I went straight into the main course from there which in my case was the beef tenderloin with dark cocoa balsamic reduction in tarragon..was happy to see some one finallyyyyy taking risks and getting adventurous with steaks, preparing them in a different way. I really liked it, although was a bit peeved by the fact that I specifically asked for medium well and what was served was welldone. This is always a problem with restaurants they just can\u0027t seem to get it right, my friend ordered te beef tenderloin in Chardonnay..in his case the beef was cooked perfectly but I wasn\u0027t too excited about the sauce. I happened to try the angel hair pasta with mussels, scallops and squid. I have to say this dish was prepared very well, it was light and the favors blended perfectly, I would go back there for this dish in particular. The dessert I ordered was the chocolate fondant, was impressed by the very thin film of cake around the lava, something which is missing in the one at pompei which actually feels like a solid sponge cake another thing that was lacking was the burnt caramel ice cream that u get at Pompei. Did not like the vanilla dollop on the side which if I\u0027m not mistaken was not made in the kitchen but most likely bought from the market. \n\nThe service: aahh the service, I\u0027m guessing it would have been better if the majority of the waitier force was not at Adnans table..sorry dude but they were :) ..I happened to get a table in the non smoking section. BAD idea!! Everytime the kitchen door swung open it was like a bar fight in there! Not a pleasant experience! I think I had to wait way too long for my meal, I got there at 935 left at 1145. Had to get the waiters attention more then once. \nAll in all Id have to say I did enjoy the food I ordered, and the fact that it was nice to see someone taking risks with the way food is ordinarily prepared in most restaurants.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T20:19:38+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"395859890465167","from":{"name":"Omar Omari","id":"508277151"},"message":"I apologize if my review was erratic and all over the place, but i am kinda sleepy","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T20:21:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"395864000464756","from":{"name":"Omar Omari","id":"508277151"},"message":"The 44 house pasta was extremely rich..I was floored with one mouthful..heavy stuff but I agree, was flavorful","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T20:29:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"395900820461074","from":{"name":"Omar Omari","id":"508277151"},"message":"True say..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T21:46:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"395902853794204","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"whether fore warned or not - its proves that they can serve that level - so why not to every customer - i am not talking about just 44 here - but generally - why do patrons have to drop names of owners or now  food pages to get decent service - why not everyone who is walking in and going to pay for the the food in front of them","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T21:51:10+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"396090333775456","from":{"name":"Sohail Maskatiya","id":"738981577"},"message":"A brief description of the 44 house pasta would be appreciated.

(I did not get the teaser or the invite in time and was sent an e-invite.) Not being a blogger myself, this is my first experience on an event such as this and my personal stance on the event is as follows:\n\nIn my mind I always equate Magnum to the 7 deadly sins, opulence and decadence. Yesterday at the presentation, it felt that their branding had changed focus to a more regal and royal theme but still having the underlined feel of opulence and decadence.  They wanted to portray that if you eat a Magnum, you would feel like being a King or Queen. Their main ingredient that would help them achieve that was “Belgian Chocolate”.  How they are going to educate the masses regarding the qualities of the Belgian chocolate was not discussed and as you can see from the youtube clip (it is the same one from their own presentation) there is no mention of Belgian chocolate!  Another point is when I tasted the Magnum, the chocolate did not feel any different from other Magnums that I have tasted previously.\n \nTheir target market was 18-35 years old and people who fell into a more affluential  background. Their claim was that the Magnum was going to be the most expensive ice cream in Pakistan per single serving and that they would also be opening a Magnum Café. The magnum Café would also have a “Make your own” Magnum dipping station. Although a fun idea, a dipping station is in my opinion is something  which is more catered towards children rather than adults and as I witnessed it was quite a messy job too! The dippings that they had were sprinkles, nuts and fruits, chocolate etc. Personally I find it very hard to see how any person could stick pieces of fruit on to the Magnum and I for one think fruit is a bad idea.\n\nOn the whole, will the Magnum entice the Pakistan public.... probably Yes! But will it be a profitable venture and achieve their goals and profit margins, that...... time will tell :-)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-03T08:25:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-13T01:35:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"795545463","name":"Riffat Alam"},{"id":"1091434889","name":"Haris Khan"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"1473431885","name":"Syed Aamir Bukhari"},{"id":"100000093496883","name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzMzcxOTYzMA\u003d\u003d","before":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"391463167571506","from":{"name":"Sarah J.K","id":"708025491"},"message":"lol cute ad...  they shoulda re-enacted something like this","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-03T10:33:02+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391477424236747","from":{"name":"Aruna Sujanani","id":"691887360"},"message":"They kinda did.

So we started to look for another option n end up at Gracis....  n yes it was the best decision.. We ordered fried basket n some shrimp (I forgot the dish name) but it was nice, they brought us ginger bread complimentary which was so fresh n crunchy as well as fried Basket which included fries n chicken strips..... Yummy it was, but I would recommend  change of oil as it has some different smell which was killing the taste. However the main hero was main course.... I had ordered crispy chicken with mushroom sauce in jeliphnos n my husband ordered mexican beef stake. Both had side lines as French fries or sauté veggi or jacket potato or hash potato. We opt for Vaggis, hash n jacket potatoes... His food was so nice that in every bite he was  praising n thanking me to part of swot group ( that\u0027s how I come to know about that place)... My dish was awesome compered to what I have had before in other restaurants.. We ordered lady red cocktail for me n leman mint for hubby... We both were happy with choice.... All and all we had best experience but I m fail to understand one thing...that such marvelous food n cool ambience there wasn\u0027t any other table full... We were the only ppl there...as we had book the place for ourself....
