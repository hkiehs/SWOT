Also the original ones are not that MEETHAY, neither is the cream made of only sugar. \nSo, dear LU, i am sorry but i will still go for KRAFT when it comes to oreo. \n\nP.S: Kraft has actually bought LU and its a joint venture.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-10T03:56:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-13T05:42:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1314925986","name":"Kauser Jamal"},{"id":"553305273","name":"Kulsum Wasty"},{"id":"613037941","name":"Faiza Afzal"},{"id":"650649934","name":"Ashnaa F Khan"},{"id":"649638362","name":"Raabi Rehman S"},{"id":"763004361","name":"Amna Saeed"},{"id":"681193111","name":"Shiraz Sheikh"},{"id":"564100900","name":"Fawad Hai"},{"id":"661524181","name":"Farhan Pardesi"},{"id":"592929129","name":"Aqsa Jaliawala"},{"id":"745345444","name":"Anas Mahmood"},{"id":"100000579313166","name":"Xobi Shah"},{"id":"531870819","name":"Bushra Samad Abdullah"},{"id":"506556189","name":"Mishal Moeez"},{"id":"512085922","name":"Ayesha Nadeem"},{"id":"769195300","name":"Hira Farooq Rasheed"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"100000238497030","name":"Madiiha N Narrejo"},{"id":"1571433189","name":"Sumaiya Shoaib"},{"id":"575226136","name":"Sarah Rahim"},{"id":"716107438","name":"Hira Zindani"},{"id":"586485141","name":"Atif Shakeel Qureshi"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"680561502","name":"Shaharyar Siddiqui"},{"id":"701296018","name":"Munazza Sheikh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzAxMjk2MDE4","before":"MTMxNDkyNTk4Ng\u003d\u003d"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_647677245283429/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNzAxMjk2MDE4"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"647689451948875","from":{"name":"Arsalan Ahmed Shaikh","id":"683051252"},"message":"its no more kraft.. its Mondelez now","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-10T04:58:25+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647690201948800","from":{"name":"Arsalan Ahmed Shaikh","id":"683051252"},"message":"LU has always been a trademark of Mondelez (formerly KRAFT)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-10T05:01:03+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647700721947748","from":{"name":"Ansab Sid","id":"641172149"},"message":"My bullshit detector detects that there is no such thing as an OREO expert.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-10T05:49:54+0000","like_count":31,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647706965280457","from":{"name":"Ali Nadeem","id":"100001691885342"},"message":"LU ka Orio is crap","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-10T06:04:01+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647725581945262","from":{"name":"Asma Manzar Khurram Honey","id":"630956019"},"message":"My son all d time ask his baba lu walay oreo twist keisaaay kerooon :D ho nai rehay plz help meee","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-10T07:27:17+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647727775278376","from":{"name":"S M Uzair Raza","id":"100004024524064"},"message":"RIP oreo :\u0027(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-10T07:35:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647730975278056","from":{"name":"Nasim Ahmad","id":"1343979604"},"message":"Salaams Umer and your critical analysis of the local Oreo\u0027s worth a million bucks.

So, for 3 people, we ordered the following:\n\n* Chicken Corn Soup (I know, not many people order the classic Chicken Corn Soup, neither do we, but mother just insisted) - We ordered the large serving of the soup, and it was exactly 3 bowls of soup. No more, no less. Yes it was stated already in the menu that it serves 2-3 people, but the Ginsoy - Extreme Chinese fan in us thought there\u0027d be more. Not at all a disappointment though, by any means. It was exactly what Chicken Corn Soup needs to be. Small little bits, but sufficient, of chicken, adequate amount of corn. The soup was just what it was supposed to be.\n\n* Wasabi Prawns for appetizers - The prawns were remarkably done. They had that wasabi-kick in them which was needed to give that \"buzz\" feel you want to have when eating a Wasabi Prawn. Yet again, there were 5 prawns in total, dot. Tastewise: Brilliant.\n\n* Fish Milano (my main) - Their Fish Milano was intended to be  a large fried fillet of fish placed delicately over a bed of green-herbs sauce and coated with cheese served with rice (as understood from the menu). It was exactly as described. I needed something cheesy and rich, and it definitely delivered. The fish was nicely done; flaky, properly fried, the type that just wants you to keep eating it. The green sauce under the fish was generous in quantity, but didn\u0027t quite have much of a \"burst of flavors\" that I was hoping for. But the cheese on top took care of that. All in all, a 7/10\n\n* Fish with Jalapeno *something*, mum\u0027s main (apologies for not remembering the complete name) - A similar sized fish to mine, fried as nicely as mine was, sat on the plate with sauteed vegetables, a serving of rice, and a small little bowl/cup containing the sauce for this dish. This sauce however, did have a distinctive taste to it. I actually borrowed some of it to use on my fish as well. The one thing common in the 2 mains was that the steamed rice that were served with them were simply the best ever steamed rice I\u0027ve ever had in my life. The rice had an amazing feel to them in the mouth that is probably inexplicable, yet noticeable. An 7.5/10\n\n* Black Pepper Chicken and Garlic Rice, sold separately (father\u0027s main) - Hands down, the highlight of the day. Never have I tasted Black Pepper Chicken done so beautifully crafted in terms of flavor. And the Garlic Rice were \"actually\" Garlic Rice, not a joke in the name of garlic. You could just bring the bowl of rice close to your nostrils and know for a fact how nicely the garlic was incorporated in the rice. Father won, simple. Would definitely give 8.5/10\n\nWe ordered 3 drinks to go with the meal: Mint Julep, Blue Margarita, Peach *something*. In terms of the quantity of the drinks, father (Mint Julep) won again. Then mum (Peach *something) and then me. Again.\nThe experience, in terms of cozy sitting, soothing music being played in the background (rather than some pop/rap/hip-hop artist blaring) and most importantly, taste, was great. Definitely a place I\u0027d go over and over again.\nThe only problem that I have is that the portions could be slightly bigger, because when you pay about Rs. 5000 for a meal of 3, you sort-of expect to be filled to the hilt. But it wasn\u0027t so. But it was 5000 bucks well-spent for taste. Definitely well-spent if \"taste\" was (and mostly, it is) meant to be the star. I would just say, if they could slightly beef up their quantity too, it\u0027ll do wonders.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-12T03:34:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-12T20:01:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1352533620","name":"Sakina Nanabhai"},{"id":"1088748635","name":"Aqsa Shah"},{"id":"1241948621","name":"Nayab Shakil"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"100002608457065","name":"Haroona Khawar"},{"id":"100001249191882","name":"Fozia Amjad"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"628495513","name":"Fariha Harris"},{"id":"617371190","name":"Samar Mughal"},{"id":"100001697508377","name":"Hira Qazi"},{"id":"550700453","name":"Ammar Amjad"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1202678003","name":"Aisha Naayaab Rao"},{"id":"614747510","name":"Tariq Hameed Siddiqui"},{"id":"100001419761223","name":"Imran Malik"},{"id":"756768261","name":"Muhammad Aslam"},{"id":"535065551","name":"Hassan Khan"},{"id":"789225723","name":"Lalarukh Khursheed Farooqui"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM4MjM2MTI1Ng\u003d\u003d","before":"NTA4OTIyNTA5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"648625911855229","from":{"name":"Sajjad Ahmed","id":"1382361256"},"message":"well described!thanks....but 5000 rupees too much!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-12T04:35:05+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"648630128521474","from":{"name":"Ehtesham Maqbool","id":"189100160"},"message":"Nice detailed review.

Kolachi has really awesome food and is THE restaurant experience in the Phase 8 strip, if not the whole of Karachi itself. I love the new first-come-first-serve system, now we dont have to go back disappointed learning the whole place is booked. After waiting a mere 5 minutes for our table we got a nice table on the deck. We ordered Lahori Fish as starters and although I am not a seafood fan but those finger fish are something special. They were tangy, slightly crispy and the sauce given with them complimented the dish excellently. For the main course we ordered the Kolachi Special Steak (Chicken), Paneer Reshmi and Chicken Turkey sandwich. The Kolachi Special Steak in beef is my humble opinion the best steak available in Karachi and the chicken one has come to par with it. The Paneer Reshmi with garlic and roghni naan was a delight as ever, however for our own guilty indulgence we also had it with paratha. The Chicken Turkey sandwich was a light yet fulfilling meal and tasted as a sandwich, Im glad they dont overdo it or give a small sampling, they just provide with what is expected in a good sandwich. I ordered the blue margarita drink which I enjoyed with my steak. My diet conscious friends had lemongrass tea after the meal and according to them it helped settle down the food, however my greedy tastebuds would only go for a sweet dessert after a good meal. We ordered Zafran and Pista Kulfi and again, Kolachi did not disappoint by giving an authentic taste yet a familiar feeling to the food that just makes you fell in love with it. You guys must have guessed that we are fans of Kolachi (like so many other people who have no complains with the place). The service is great, friendly and cooperative and seeing the ambience and quality, the price is very economical.
