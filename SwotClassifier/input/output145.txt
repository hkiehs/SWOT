Had to head to Dolmen Mall again today!!!!! Yes yes I know himat hai.\n\nGot a funky tangerine shirt from gulabo and one from khaadi and some low calorie pudding pots from hyper. But had lunch at the only place that serves edible food in DMC. The Noodle House Dolmen City. The lunch deals were explored and at 899/- exclusive  of tax for one starter, main drink and 2scoops of ice cream is not too bad. \n\nFor three people we ordered \n1 Thai beef salad\n1 Asian chopped salad \n1 Thai chicken with cashew nuts\n1 Thai green vegetable curry\n1 large laksa\n1 lychee pine tea\n1 frozen fruit slushy thingy.\n1 fresh lime in sevenup\n1 tea \n\nWe got 4 scoops of home ice cream.\n\nThe salad were amazing. And addictive. The laksa was even worse than last time and I will not be ordering that again. The Thai chicken was well cooked succulent and flavorful. I liked the finely shredded kafir lime leaves for the aroma. The Thai green curry was full of different colourful  vegetables and thu the one at FUCHSIA is better, this one does get some points for the effort. The vegetables thu could have been less wilted. The wok fried noodles served with the chicken were sent back as they were just noodles dipped in cold stale oil. The egg fried rice was however perfectly flavored and cooked.\n\nIt\u0027s a pity that such a lovely place with a lovely view (especially in this weather) was kinda empty but we also went there around 2:45.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-10T16:22:31+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-11T10:35:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"736493359","name":"Adnan Ahmad"},{"id":"100000613630813","name":"Zoja Noaman"},{"id":"849085572","name":"Hasham Ibrahim Khan"},{"id":"591022035","name":"Sameer Mirza"},{"id":"531056010","name":"Samreen Feroz"},{"id":"100002628885416","name":"Muhammad Salman"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"100003971348832","name":"Ingloriously Vain Faced"},{"id":"100000999733392","name":"Hadi Khan"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"539145384","name":"Saher Shaikh"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg1NTA1ODY2","before":"NjI1OTY4OTUz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"631587193559101","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"This ASIAN CHOPPED SALAD has become a fav of mine since last week.
