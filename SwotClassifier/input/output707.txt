Never has this been the case with food at Fuji. Each one of us have lodged our complaints with them, left comments on their comment cards, spoke to the staff about it, just if someone here represents the management, please ask them to give us our old Fuji back. \nTalkign of sushi, in the sushi world we now have Oishi Sushi that closed down from its Port Grand venue and opened up right next to China Kitchen.
