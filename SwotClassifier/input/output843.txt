My dad called around 7:30 p.m. for reservations, but they said they had no tables available. Then, Dad asked for a gentleman who he knows there (I feel like I should keep his identity private for protection :p), and was reassured that a table will be reserved from him. So here\u0027s another place where phawwa works. We got there around 8ish, and were taken upstairs. My first time dining in at Ginsoy, and I gotta tell ya, we loved it! There were four people including myself, the \u0027rents and my aunt. The prawn crackers and green chutney came first, which were a bit cold, but otherwise yum. We ordered the hot and sour soup, butterfly prawns and spring rolls. The soup came along relatively quickly, and it was enough for 8 people. No joke. Delicious, as always. Then came the appetizers simultaneously. The spring rolls were delicious, and the dipping sauce with them was nice too. The butterfly prawns unfortunately, were pretty tough to cut into and chew, and had a mild fishy smell. I had two bites of that and left it. Once the soup and appetizer dishes were cleared away and the dinner plates set out, we waited a good while, which I didn\u0027t time, since I was in good company and I seriously needed that space to let the soup settle a little. I seriously wouldn\u0027t have been able to eat otherwise. Along came my favorite, the American chop suey, followed by the cherry chilli chicken, vegetable fried rice, chicken with mushrooms in oyster sauce and kung pao chicken. The servings were ginormous, each thing better than the last, but my favorite has got to be the chop suey. However, halfway into the meal, my father and I started feeling the after-effects of MSG. Uh-oh! We\u0027d forgotten to ask them to avoid using that, but it seemed as if the amount used was very less since our reactions weren\u0027t as painful as they usually are. The bill was ridiculously inexpensive for our entire meal, specially for the servings and quality of food. Leftovers for me for tomorrow! Yay, Ginsoy!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-21T18:56:01+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-21T19:09:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"562192428","name":"Mehr Azeem"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA4ODc0NDI2NQ\u003d\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"401741583210331","from":{"name":"Kh Taha Saeed","id":"508974845"},"message":"Seriously ....tum bahut zyada farigh ho !!!!!!!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-21T18:58:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401741933210296","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Dant jaallluussss.
