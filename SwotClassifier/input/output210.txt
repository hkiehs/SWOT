The place is just off Naheed\u0027s on Shaheed-e-Millat Road, and was formerly Arizona Grill.  Met up with an old friend there, and ordered the Flamied Grill Steak.\n\nI am generally wary of ordering steaks at a place which has Arizona in its name, or which in its menu serves more than 70% of steak entrees with random sauces.  Ordered a Flamed Grill Steak, since the description didn\u0027t enlist any sauce for it, and asked for it to be Medium Rare.\n\nWhat I was served was basically \u0027Beef Pasanday\u0027, and there is absolutely no way the entree can be classified as a steak.  There was no need for it to be Medium Rare, because beef pasanday are just served as beef pasanday, and not Medium Rare!\n\nWhat Grill House needs to do is add a side of potatoes, and serve some hot naan with pasanday -- and accordingly change the name of \u0027Flamed Grill Steak\u0027 to \u0027Masalaydaar Pasanday\u0027.  I am sure that Maslaydaar Pasanday can be their best selling entree, if they can serve karak naan with it, and some raaita too, of course.\n\nThe place is blasphemy to the religion of steaks, and the beef entrees are only recommended if one is looking for a filling meal of pasanday.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-11T16:47:18+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-11T20:45:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"533260601","name":"Ali Shahid"},{"id":"506634707","name":"Iqra Anwar Shah"},{"id":"654231486","name":"Sami Khan"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"1664160731","name":"Amna Abbasi"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"553350590","name":"Faizan Chaghtai"},{"id":"502158910","name":"Mujtaba Karim"},{"id":"561575202","name":"Usuf Haroon"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100000087775469","name":"Arshad Shamsi"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"569950203","name":"Anis Rajwani"},{"id":"511149199","name":"Shaherbano H.
