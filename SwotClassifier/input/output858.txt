Wow!\nThe ambiance and the setup was amazing! Loved everything from the lighting to the different decks to sit on to the salt and pepper shakers!:-)\nIt surely was something way different from all the other phase 8 eatery!\nService was good! Did not once have to look for the waiter as other places! Trained well, something not expected from the phase 8 eating:-)\nSo many different kinds of food items available from steak to burgers to desi \n\nWe chose karahi as that\u0027s what we had made out mood for eating before leaving home but I surely was tempted to get their steaks/salads\n\nAnd we ordered humus! Only thing missing was the pita bread as they did not have that! Was offered it with garlic nan! But it\u0027s not the same thing!\n\nOverall experience was great!

Must say I agree in most part with your reviews. However there were some issues I pointed out. Firstly the cheese nachos were too \u0027processed\u0027 for my taste. They were simply spicy doritos covered in canned cheese dip and salsa. I was told that corn chips were not available locally(??) and therefore they had to stick to doritos. Secondly all of us ordered our burgers with the orginal bun which I feel does not do the juicy burger justice. Again I was told that Dawn is the only option so choice is limited. Salads, a few of them like the eggplant tomato was outstanding, wheras the pasta salad lacked oomph. However would I go again? Most certainly because I feel Gun Smoke will be ironing out minor glitches in no time and will live up to expectations set in part ,but obviously not solely,by its amazing ambience...","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T15:24:33+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-13T21:52:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"508277151","name":"Omar Omari"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397325390318617","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Ambareen Khan - hey you should have told us - wow - so there were more SWOTTIES at the SWOT opening\n\ni totally agree - the doritos were a big disappointment  and must be worked on. the salad bar thu limited was good and fresh, the sauces a little thin for my taste but for a huge 150 person seater buffet i guess it ok. the rice was under cooked and the corn was hard. \n\neven thu everyone loved their soup - i found it too acid and there was no roasted flavor, \n\nbut other than these minor glitches - which believe me many wont notice - Gun Smoke is set up a new standard in diner food","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T15:34:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"676177213","name":"Ambareen Khan","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"397497386968084","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"yea chupkay say aati hain, aik dafa deekhti hain, aur khaosh rehti hain.
