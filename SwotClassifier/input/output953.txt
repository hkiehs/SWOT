I think we have had just about enough of this ‘holier than SWOT’ posts on the \u0027new\u0027 group Karachi Food Diary in the last 30 something hours.. Please people, you have to stop giving innuendos about how that group is better than SWOT. We all know that that group WILL BE better than SWOT because it is benefiting immensely from SWOT’s experience. The fact remains that this Karachi Food Diary is building on the original concept and hard work of one Nezihe Hussain!! Accept it or not, she is the pioneer of this food/ restaurant review scene in Pakistan.. Fine, the group moderation was not at its best, there were mistakes made, but that’s all part of the learning process, which this new group stands to benefit from.. They are starting at a higher point in this learning curve and they have to give due credit to SWOT for bearing with and resolving all the teething issues. She built this base of 3400 in one year that they are set to capture in perhaps three days. I urge you all to please acknowledge her efforts and stop this indirect banter on KFD page. Thank you. \nAnd btw, I am seriously not liking how the restaurant owners/ representatives who are always so vocal here are choosing to stay quiet now.\nAnd those of you who don\u0027t know what I\u0027m talking about, I\u0027m sure you will be added to this new group soon, and you will know what this is about.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-22T00:33:19+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-22T12:21:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"764425006","name":"Alisa Zulfiqar Zuberi"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"1092810743","name":"Imran Nanjiani"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"632567679","name":"Irfan Malik"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"686712045","name":"Irfan Aslam"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAyODQxNzU4","before":"NzY0NDI1MDA2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"300980819953075","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"\u003c3 - I think you just moved from the SWOT\u0027s Ladies Wing to the SWOT MUTAHIDDA\u0027s Tigers commander post!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-22T00:35:46+0000","like_count":10,"user_likes":false},{"id":"300981053286385","from":{"name":"Saira Malik","id":"1133719630"},"message":"\u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-22T00:36:14+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"300987483285742","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Saira is a true friend and a SWOTTIE - she has epitomised the true loyal sprite that is the makings of a SWOTTIE (connoisseur of fine things in life).

Worked great but then the far eastern developed their version of cat fish which grew fast (twice) than the Americans version.. This giving them 3crops a year... This pissed off the Americans and they went to court on patent rights... Lost the case but won that only Americans can use the word cat fish.. So Vietnam and others now use pangus.... This is a revolutionary fish and has the capability to become the next staple food of the world..... I can go on and on.. But anyways... What\u0027s important for consumers is that 1-this fish arrives at the factories in VN alive and between their dying (by a stroke of knife) till freezer it takes only 25minutes...
