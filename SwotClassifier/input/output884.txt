Ended up at the Dolmen Mall wala Butlers. Wouldn\u0027t you know it, two flies greeted us before the servers could, and at least one of them remained to keep us company so we wouldn\u0027t get lonely. How nice. We ordered the Butlers club sandwich, my sister ordered the traditional chocolate shake, and I ordered the pina colada. Aside from the friendly flies, things were grand. Once the sandwich arrived and we each took a bite, my sister declared it \u0027unimpressive\u0027. However, I enjoyed it since the bread and vegetables were fresh, and I could taste the delicate honey mustard and tender chicken. The fries were thin and crisp and we got a generous helping of ketchup. After polishing off the first piece, I went in for the second. Unfortunately, there was a wad of tissue paper wrapped around the lettuce in the middle of the sandwich and was hanging out the bottom. Now, I\u0027m not a fussy customer. I loathe writing negative reviews, and I detest customers who treat an eating out experience like a free meal. However, I do believe that if I can do anything to help out an establishment from a customer\u0027s point of view, I do so. Once I discreetly showed our server the tissue wala sandwich, he whisked it off and returned 5 minutes later asking if we wanted another sandwich. I said, \u0027No, thank you\u0027 with a smile, and the rest of our eating experience moved along pleasantly enough since I got to eat all the fries. Yay! When the bill came along, my sister exclaimed over how we were charged fully for the club sandwich when one-fourth of it wasn\u0027t even consumed. I told her we were looked after well enough, and to leave things be. Although I have no complaints, I would suggest everyone look into your food before chowing down. After all, you don\u0027t want tissue flavored with honey mustard in your tummy :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-28T14:15:13+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-29T08:49:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"739670623","name":"Faryal Naqvi"},{"id":"570766058","name":"Ayesha Saeed"},{"id":"585622689","name":"Naveed Ismail"},{"id":"100000271785679","name":"Farhan Sultan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwMjcxNzg1Njc5","before":"NzM5NjcwNjIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"387813854603104","from":{"name":"Misbah Omar","id":"509911471"},"message":"agreed 100% with the above!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-28T15:59:25+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"387816681269488","from":{"name":"Marvi Jatoi","id":"1108385601"},"message":"I happened to stop by butlers at dolmen mall, to get some chocolates, there were flies on the chocolates.. i asked the waiter to throw them away, and he did.. but why were there flies in the 1st place?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-28T16:04:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"387824781268678","from":{"name":"Amna Jatoi","id":"100001692464184"},"message":"Dolmen Mall wala butlers sucks!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-28T16:20:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"387851167932706","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Muneeza and Marvi, it\u0027s a relief to know I\u0027m not the only one who experienced the flies and extras in my food.
