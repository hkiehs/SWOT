In such chaotic and troubled times if someone has taken an initiative and managed to open up 3 of the outlets of a brand which is famous worldwide, then it is indeed very daring of him and definitely requires a lot of support from the citizens. Secondly stop comparing BK with burger shack. BK is a little bit on the dryer side worldwide and its fan following is accordingly. Hardees and burger shack are in a different league of greasy burgers so comparing BS with Hardees seems more appropriate. Thirdly get your arrogance and pessimism off your heads. BK is serving pretty decent burgers and fries. Encourage them rather than coming up with the wierdest of comments and reviews.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-08T11:31:01+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-08T19:23:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000155371840","name":"Sabih Kirmani"},{"id":"1781512632","name":"Vishal Preetam"},{"id":"847040400","name":"Maryam Rauf"},{"id":"60506083","name":"Marium S.
