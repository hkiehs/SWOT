It was not the first time ordering but this time I would like to try something different. Placed my order directly with Qamarunnisa , specifically told her what I wanted and even the time for delivery. All was taken care of and at exactly 5pm, the rider came with the piping hot food. \n\nI ordered a meal for 3-4 people @ Rs 1250. It consisted of Chicken Corn Soup, Egg Fried Rice, Chicken Chowmien, Chicken Szechuan and Fried Wontons. They even gave me a complimentary steamed wontons :) Thank you! I baked a Chocolate Happy Birthday Cake recipe from Food Diaries Zarnak Sidhwa - and boy it was a really yummy cake! Everyone tasted it and now Im left with only a small slice of it. Thanks Zarnak!\n\nWe had all the dishes at 7pm and the food was still warm. Even though it was for 3-4 people but the whole family of 6 adults and 4 children (under 8yo) had a full meal and believe me, there is still some left. Really great value for money! \n\nEveryone commented the food was delicious \u0026 kids loved the soup! \n\nThank you to Golden Dragon \u0026 Qamarunnisa for the delicious food, everyone enjoyed it and happy to say that we are all Goldenzied :)","type":"photo","created_time":"2012-11-21T05:08:45+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-23T16:06:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"100001603784203","name":"Bilaval Qamar"},{"id":"575820034","name":"Maheen Kamran"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"100002785190370","name":"Vseem Gaved"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"1016847377","name":"Zartaj Mohmand"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"786471893","name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nzg2NDcxODkz","before":"MTAwMDAwNjg4MTgyNTAy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"462887963762359","from":{"name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed","id":"786471893"},"message":"The wontons look great!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-21T05:19:47+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"462924240425398","from":{"name":"Bushra Joyo","id":"1421223164"},"message":"I love GD food !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-21T07:51:22+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"463006203750535","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Need.To.Order.GD.Soon.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-21T13:49:35+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"463018913749264","from":{"name":"Zartaj Mohmand","id":"1016847377"},"message":"Golden Dragon and Zarnak Sidwa never disappoint:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-21T14:28:31+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"463019223749233","from":{"name":"Ezwana R-Zaman","id":"701414399"},"message":"Zartaj Mohmand - totally agree on that! now waiting for an occasion to try our your yummy breads!! :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-21T14:29:14+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"463020930415729","from":{"name":"Zartaj Mohmand","id":"1016847377"},"message":"Anytime dear:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-21T14:34:34+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"463446603706495","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Thanks Ezwana!!!!
