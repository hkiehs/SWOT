And fell in loveee with the concept, the dauntless and audacious brand personality, the execution and the ambiance. Ordered their Besharam Topless Burger, naturally, and fell in love with that too – sans the egg (don’t know if I intend the pun). Chose SB again this Saturday - a very special occasion - because I\u0027d loved it that much the first time around. Upon arriving we could see that it was overcrowded and were told to wait for a bit, which was perfectly fine considering it was a Saturday night. \nI found it really sweet that the owner\u0027s family/acquaintances were helping him out with managing the overburdened situation. The owner himself was doing the rounds and serving people where needed. As our wait prolonged, we asked a lady who was helping out with the management if it was possible that we could place our order while we waited to be seated – a query to which a simple yes or no answer could have sufficed. Her reply ‘No we are not taking any orders. Please be patient’ did not sit well with me; however, I let it go, attributing her biting tone and reply to the stressful situation that she was in.\n\nOnce seated we had to wait for a looooonnnngggggg time for the food to arrive. After an hour or so had passed, the same lady came by to ask us if ‘everything was fine’. At which I told her that obviously it wasn’t since we had been waiting that long for a bun kebab and Panini – an order which the waiter himself admitted doesn’t take longer than 10 minutes to prepare. She stated that the food ‘would take long’; the frankness of the offered truth could have been appreciated if only she hadn’t added to my fiancé ‘don’t look so unhappy, you WILL get food’.\n\nShortly after, we overheard the same lady asking this couple seated next to us if she could take an empty chair off their table. At which they told her they might need it later as they were expecting someone to join them. The lady unpleasantly started interrogating them about how many people they had said they wanted a table for when they had requested to be seated etc. \n\nWe had reached SB at 9.15 pm, and were finally served the bun kebab and Panini at 10.50 pm. The bun kebab was comparable to Roadside’s Dhaga Bun Kabab (which I LOVE), the Hunter Chicken Panini was quite frankly very disgusting and tasted (and smelled) of raw chicken. After we were done eating, I walked to the counter myself to get the bill as I wasn’t too keen on waiting further. The owner upon seeing this offered to get the bill over himself, which was considerate of him. Before he put the box in which the bill was encased down properly, he turned and walked off, sort of dropping the case onto the table.\n\nI didn’t mind the wait. I didn’t mind the bland and raw Panini. They are new and it was probably one of the first times they were handling such a constant influx of customers. They were understaffed. But none of these can be justification of being rude to a customer. Good and bad service notwithstanding, assuming a patronizing attitude can prove to be suicidal for a service oriented business. We went to buy ourselves dinner, we did not go to be preached a lesson of patience or to be treated like we were there for a freebie. To that hyper lady, I would only say that when I go to work every weekday morning, I leave my attitude and any delusional notions of the world revolving around me behind at home. I suggest she do the same. To the owner, I love your restaurant, I really do, but don’t see myself coming around anymore. Do remember that in this industry, the customer ought to be the king, so don’t please sit on that throne yourself.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-16T10:08:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-16T11:07:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"611865533","name":"Shayan Mehboob"},{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"614144691","name":"Saman Ishan"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"531056010","name":"Samreen Feroz"},{"id":"577409061","name":"Maaz Jamal"},{"id":"783794861","name":"Ayesha Oosman"},{"id":"712230730","name":"Hammad Ahmed"},{"id":"524665437","name":"Saher Najam"},{"id":"592929129","name":"Aqsa Jaliawala"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTkyOTI5MTI5","before":"NjExODY1NTMz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619549764762844","from":{"name":"Abdul Shakoor Motiwala","id":"590540852"},"message":"check my review i was there on Saturday too you are too kind with your words","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T10:27:23+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619553031429184","from":{"name":"Sheeza Ahmed","id":"552305433"},"message":"Its a pity, considering the energy-infused and refreshing menu that they have to offer.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T10:40:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619553401429147","from":{"name":"Samreen Feroz","id":"531056010"},"message":"Consistency is THE trait of a winner.

We went around ten and it was crowded. We went inside and a sweet older lady told us to please give her two minutes to sort out a table for 5. We politely said sure take your time. Another waiter came over and again told us we will just arrange something. We were totally okay to wait. Then a few minutes later another lady came who was rather rude said, \"It will take 20 minutes.\" We told her that the other lady and waiter just said that they were arranging something. She again rudely said, \"no it will take 20 minutes. You can see if you want to wait.\" We did not appreciate the tone but we saw some friends on two tables that were placed right at the end of restaurant. Next to the door through which you get to the bathroom. So we went over to chit chat.\nThat lady came back to us in 5 minutes and very rudely said, \" Will you please settle down. I told you it will be twenty minutes. You are disturbing my customers. I need you all to settle down.\" This was highly offensive. We are a group of 30 year olds who were just chit chatting with some friends. Definitely not being rowdy and not getting in anyones way. The place which was quite loud itself, I\u0027m sure a couple of voices did not raise the roof. The two tables were all our friends and the other tables were at a distance from us so I looked around to see who we were disturbing and surely no -one gave a darn about us being there. On her comment, I wanted to ask her, \" Do we not look like customers to you?\" But we even let that one go. \nMy husband asked if she could arrange 5 chairs around these two tables just because they were placed as such. She rudely said, \"No\". My husband suggested one small table could be accommodated there. She gave him the look of death like he had lost his mind. She again rudely said, \"NO. We can\u0027t pick up tables and move them around. You will just have to wait.\" I don\u0027t understand why that was so ridiculous as most places try to accommodate their customers by joining tables and chairs. Even then that could have been said nicely. Our friends started offering us seats to sit with them to which she very rudely said, \"I need you all to settle down. You can\u0027t wait here. You have to go outside and wait.\" It was like a teacher talking to a bunch of students like no one is allowed to stand in this place. Everyone must remain seated at all times. It was highly offensive. Again, if we were being rowdy, loud, or getting in anyones way I would have understood her annoyance. But this was ridiculous. Unfortunately, this was the final blow. We decided to leave. Even though by now she was getting some waiters to bring us some chairs but we had enough. Seeing us leave,  she again said, \"It will take twenty minutes\" to which my husband replied, \"No thanks but I just don\u0027t like your attitude.\" She was taken aback but continued to argue how there was no attitude. My husband said, \"It\u0027s still there.\" She just made a surprised face and then tried to apologize but one of those apologies,\" Im sorry if you thought I was rude!\"  Yeah sure, It was all in our minds! \n It was enough obnoxious behavior to last us for a while. Even though we were all excited to check out this new joint, don\u0027t think we are going back any time soon. Unfortunately, these joints should understand that nothing substitutes for good customer service.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T10:59:34+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619558464761974","from":{"name":"Parisa Siddiqi","id":"501377455"},"message":"Sorry for the super long post but still a bit frustrated about it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T11:00:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619559391428548","from":{"name":"Sheeza Ahmed","id":"552305433"},"message":"Hahahaha, sounds like that same woman :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T11:04:21+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619559401428547","from":{"name":"Samreen Feroz","id":"531056010"},"message":"You husband did the super right thing!.
