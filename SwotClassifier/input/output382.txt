If you don\u0027t have ambience, seating and location to impress the customer how can you think that lacking in the one thing you do (other than the essential making of food) is acceptable? \nI ordered Broadway Pizza for sehri and this is the second time they got me half of my order. I thought I\u0027d give them another chance since their pizza is a little better than the other alternatives. \nSo they forgot to deliver the wings and two of the four sauces. Simple enough right? I just need to call the rider and remind him of these things. I was baffled when the rider did not even apologize and said that he was too far now and delivering other orders to come back. It had been less than 5 minutes. \nRegardless, how is this an appropriate response to a customer complaint? Then we proceeded to call the helpline that had taken our order and explained the situation and that this was the second time hoping that they could fix the issue. \nI could hear the man on the phone discussing with another person whether there\u0027s anything they can do (basically whether they should bother to do anything). The man came back without even trying to get in touch with the delivery guy and said sorry we can\u0027t do anything but we can give you your remaining order free next time. I argued but to no avail. \n\nGood luck getting those to me because I\u0027m probably never ordering from your joke of a restaurant again. \nShape up or ship out guys. Stop embarrassing yourselves and annoying people.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-21T14:42:17+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-21T14:42:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"592604504","name":"Sana Naseem"},{"id":"634397563","name":"Zillehuma Maqbool Saad"},{"id":"100001816848014","name":"Subhana Rahman"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"746376004","name":"Sameen Shahid"},{"id":"549415486","name":"Yasir Ahmad"},{"id":"508829952","name":"Ayesha Saeed"},{"id":"728987421","name":"Rayyan Sohail"},{"id":"878945443","name":"Muhammad Abdullah Chaudhry"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODc4OTQ1NDQz","before":"NTkyNjA0NTA0"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_589515984432889","from":{"name":"Fatin Nawaz","id":"1629543933"},"message":"what\u0027s good at koel for iftari","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-21T11:08:43+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-21T13:56:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1519035319","name":"Ali Fawad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTUxOTAzNTMxOQ\u003d\u003d","before":"MTUxOTAzNTMxOQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"589565764427911","from":{"name":"Saeeda Rizvi","id":"100002668961403"},"message":"Paneer tikas and the kulcha breads are pretty good so are the sesame chicken strips and creme brulee for dessert, yum!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T12:42:15+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589568067761014","from":{"name":"Raheel Lakhani","id":"638437065"},"message":"Shikanjabeen and artichoke dip should not be missed.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T12:49:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589623547755466","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"The apricot kulcha is amazing.
