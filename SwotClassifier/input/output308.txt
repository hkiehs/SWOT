Well I am the owner of the cakery  \" cupcakes and more \" www.facebook.com/cupcakes8more that\u0027s being discussed here . First of all @muhmmad Nadeem sorry to know that the taste was not to your liking , (maybe its the mango flavour . ..every ones always wanting to find chocolate fudge etc in cakes ) your disappointment is acceptable and lot of hard work and passion goes into our work and it is really disappointing for us even if the client is not happy , Looking forward for you to try Are other flavours :) But @shumyla jawaid just want to clarify that the other comment just doesn\u0027t deem appropriate , to blatantly slander a product service on here-say and assume about the doings of a business ( when you haven\u0027t  even tried it )without any evidence  is unethical And unacceptable! Yes consumer maybe the king but the product owners have some rights even when their products are being critized unduly ... Firstly who has given you the right to proclaim that we use soap and detergent in our products and maybe used non edible ingreibdents( which food business  in their right mind will!!!??? Have you lab tested !!Secondly as you mentioned something about us being couple of years old etc but its been just over an year since we started , thirdly TPL is a very reputable firm in the automobile industry and it sends over hundred of giveaways to their clients year round and do you think a reputable firm will order lakhs worth of  products from someone whose products they haven\u0027t tried and tested before ? @Muhammad nadeem Yes in bulk ordering and delivering mishaps do happen , they might not have been able to deliver in time or the weather conditions may have effected and being adventurous with offering a new flavour might not have worked but assuming or slandering and turning it into gossip mongering is not acceptable ! If you have issues with our product bring it back to us or visit us ..alhamdulliah we have a very loyal client following who come to us to serve them on all their memorable occasions .","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-09T07:22:16+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false},{"id":"600851539966000","from":{"name":"Muhammad Nadeem","id":"100000189398103"},"message":"@Saba Sheraz this page for ur kind information is supposed to be a food page where we share reviews, experiences and feedback about various food and drinks. whether ur cake was mango or chocolate, one shudnt have to go through a painful process of having to identify which flavour it is. secondly no one is claiming anything about the cake. the comments above clearly say the following: \u0027Apparently whoever has tried their cakes says they smell and taste like soap and detergent\u0027 when something smells like soap and tastes like calpol, it is but natural to actually gather the courage and guts to even try something like that once! no one is gossiping here.

The reason is the owner Mrs Maryam Chu was there and she is a very kind lady. Very professional the way she was personally taking care of the orders instructing the waiters what to do and confirming if the order was served completely was simply mind blowing.\n\nWe had a conversation with her for about 15 minutes and the way she personalized that conversation it really made us feel like the most important customers. This kind of hospitality is missing in other resturants and not just in karachi even in lahore. The only reason we are going to go back there is because of her. Keep up the good work.
