Fiery, perfectly done crust, absolutely divine with the extra crushed red chillies. That was devoured. \nOrdered the Mini Burger Trio, for the very first time, usually not a fan of beef but was pleasantly surprised. The patties were succulent and pretty tasty. The condiments though were very sparse. The mushroom mini had a single sliver of a tiny mushroom, the blue cheese was the size of 1Rs coin - didn\u0027t really get that part. The wedges were nice but there should be more than 3!\nOrdered the Fish and Chips - complete disappointment for my friend.
