Its next to the relatively famous Sajjad restaurant. My friends and I go here because its far less crowded and the food is 10 times better. \nThe karahi is perfectly done every single time, with the right amount of spices and seasonings and perfectly cooked with a nice smoky flavour. \nBut the pièce de résistance of the meal is the paratha. Made in a brick oven/tandoor, its are like a cross between a naan and parton wala paratha. It has a nice roghani taste to it, with minimum amount of oil... but the way its made, with all the parats, just melting in the mouth and forming the perfect combination with the smoky taste of the handi. To die for, I tell you!\nYou can enjoy this with not just the karahi or other items on the main course like daal etc, but this paratha is simply divine with the yogurt raita they serve as well as light salted butter and the paratha. *slurp*\n\nIf any of you are willing to brave that part of town, do go to Al-Sami for a delightful meal, which is perfect yet light on the pocket.\n\nOh and this paratha goes perfectly with the delicious doodh patti chai that you can have after your meal.
