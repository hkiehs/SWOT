However yesterday I was quite put off by a hygiene issue. The syrupy fruit toppings are right next to the cash counter. As a young boy at the counter was handing me my change, ten rupees fell into the mango syrupy topping. He simply scooped out at the now very sticky ten rupee note and handed it over to me with a sorry. No attempt was made to remove the top layer of the sticky topping into which the note had fallen. This might be expecting too much but notes are quite dirty and it did not fall into a dry topping. Also since the sticky toppings are so close to the cash counter I am worried this  might be happening frequently","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-22T07:57:14+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-22T10:29:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"613037941","name":"Faiza Afzal"},{"id":"100000247881730","name":"Sarfraz Ali Siddiki"},{"id":"202908782","name":"Ayeza R Qureshi"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5NDIyOTQ0","before":"NjEzMDM3OTQx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"384019141649242","from":{"name":"Quratulaien Tanveer","id":"611720320"},"message":"That is so gross!

The restaurant has been designed very well indeed, and beckons the customer to go in, sit down and order something off the menu. Three of us went for lunch there today, but although the ambience is absolutely lovely from the front counter side... With wooden panelling, slate rules, large suede couches, and bookshelves to give it that homely feel... The large dirty windows overlooking the beach and promenade as well as an outer courtyard of the mall made a new place look run down. After going through the menu we decided to order the Philly steak sandwich, beef burger and chicken burger. We then realised orders were self service, so two of us went ahead to place them and one stayed behind to keep our spot. \nWhen my friends returned they told me they had ordered a chic coffee shake and a soda with syrup as the cafe does not serve the standard soft drinks. I then wanted to place an order for the beef burger but the girl behind the counter said they didn\u0027t  have any and suggested I try the classic burger instead. I also ordered a choc drink without cream. \nAs we ordered separately our food arrived at different times. While the steak sandwich tasted relatively good, it included large black peppers and the green pepper filling seemed soggier than it should be. My classic burger seemed like it was put together with dawn burger buns and was really a standard minced patty with an unmelted slice of processed cheddar cheese on top. The fries were much too pale, and bland. The coffee and chic drink tasted like frozen milo and while the soda cost 300 bucks - 50 extra for flavoured syrup. The burgers cost around 450 excluding tax - but gbc is far far better. \nAll in all a disappointing debut. Staff were friendly though and perhaps we just chose badly.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-21T19:59:44+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-22T08:29:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"517638658","name":"Natasha Durrani"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTg0NjgyMjQz","before":"NTE3NjM4NjU4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"383691411682015","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Shimaila Matri Dawood:- A very comprehensive and detailed review, buttom line is the food is average and not much to write about, coffee is a bit better I heard ,more people need to swot dmc gj and write their reviews, gj needs to get their act together, as they will have to face some serious competition when the complete food court opens shortly.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-21T20:16:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"383695491681607","from":{"name":"Najeeb Rehman","id":"749703456"},"message":".. buttom.. .?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-21T20:23:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"383913594993130","from":{"name":"Ambareen Khan","id":"676177213"},"message":"Just went last night, review to follow...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-22T02:57:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"383985091652647","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Typo...bottom!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-22T06:09:12+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"384023288315494","from":{"name":"Saman Jafri","id":"685000480"},"message":"the only food item worth mentioning is their club sandwich - Coffee and deserts are nice though and I love the ambiance !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-22T08:29:15+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzg0MDIzMjg4MzE1NDk0","before":"MzgzNjkxNDExNjgyMDE1"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_384010348316788","from":{"name":"Farah S.

For drinks hubby had the cold Coco Loco which was fabulous, my nephew had the cold Cookies and Cream drink(which was nice but not great). I had a mocha coffee with an extra espresso shot ,which as a coffee snob I must say was amazing!
