Went there for dinner last night and although my car hates me for it, my taste buds are still thanking me :) The chicken risotto with fresh asparagus and mushrooms was lipsmacking to say the least! Flavoursome and filling and positively yummy! Tried the blackcurrent soda to wash it down (which was allright) and followed up with (but ofcourse!) their Italian bread pudding and creme brulee. They definitely have the BEST bread pudding in town! And the creme brulee was perfectly creamy so suffice it to say I was completely stuffed beyond capacity by the end of the evening. The only problem was how long it took for the food to arrive but well that\u0027s a small price to pay for perfection when ure having fun :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-20T19:13:55+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-21T02:45:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"610590030","name":"Najam Malik"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"539875314","name":"Zara Shaheen"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"686712045","name":"Irfan Aslam"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"711344798","name":"Wajeeha Zaidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzExMzQ0Nzk4","before":"NjEwNTkwMDMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"300391406678683","from":{"name":"Chandani Asfand","id":"501816509"},"message":"I love their creme brûlée !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-21T02:45:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MzAwMzkxNDA2Njc4Njgz","before":"MzAwMzkxNDA2Njc4Njgz"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_300123206705503","from":{"name":"Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi","id":"684515056"},"message":"Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s big tub of ice cream is 600 or 900 bucks?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-20T17:57:09+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-21T02:21:35+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"300166590034498","from":{"name":"Sumera Nizamuddin","id":"719856022"},"message":"No idea never bought it here. 900 for a tub sounds hellishly high tho!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-20T19:15:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"300186670032490","from":{"name":"Erum Munir","id":"716107068"},"message":"Has anyone ever checked the expiry date on these Ben and Jerry Packs?

The first impact of a new venue should b spot on....and...... It was so very off.\n\nNo official SWOT plan but it was just a group of us ladies who wanted to get out for a good meal and good company......but what u served us...sure left u SWOTTED!! \n\n1. At first sight....food quantity was minuscule....it was as if each grain of rice, chicken diced and beef sliced was counted. Roughly one beef slice and 3-4 TINY pieces of chicken for each person. I didn\u0027t touch the crab wontons and the fish due to allergies.  So at least the others got a piece extra to share (seriously one wonton was made into 3 pieces by Reshma Rajpar to share) \n\n2. Undercooked food....chicken and beef both on my plate and others was not cooked....slimly red n pink flesh just put me so off I couldnt eat anymore (not like there was much to eat). A few others also had the same issue with their meat. \n\n3. We were adviced by management to sit inside (we wanted to sit in the patio) that sitting outside would leave us with cold food.....so then when we stayed indoors why was cold food served to us???? Not a single dish was served warm forget about being hot. \n\n4. If this was a so called \" fine dining experience \" then why was there a blender Making a huge racket just 2 feet behind us?? Is it a cafe?? \n\n5. After making a complaint to one of the partners, he told me that he would send the concerned person to us so that we may speak directly......that person NEVER came. Guess they don\u0027t wanna hear the truth\n\n6. Bill took forever to come...we were sitting almost 30 mins after food waiting for the bill....what was there to calculate when it\u0027s a set menu per head and only 2 bottles of water was ordered? \n\nA very SAD affair for sure...\n\nOnly saviour was that food was not directly proportional to the GREAT company! \n\nWe ladies made the best of it with jokes n laughter and had an \u0027entertaining\u0027 experience with the replicas of the Terracotta Army.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-19T19:59:15+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-20T21:12:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"688040667","name":"Farahnaz Haider Shaikh"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"},{"id":"711344798","name":"Wajeeha Zaidi"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"718395717","name":"Bina Ali"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMDE0NDc1NjIw","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"299533236764500","from":{"name":"Shafia Agha","id":"650845003"},"message":"should have gone to Cinnabon ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-19T20:03:12+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"299533673431123","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"Shafia Agha.....Lols!!!
