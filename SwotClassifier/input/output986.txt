But alas, what the mind wants, sometimes the stomach cannot handle since it is almost 10pm and I have not eaten since lunch!! Mariyam had the chicken, we tried both soups as well as the satay and calamari ... and finished off with bread pudding. If that was not enough, Mariyam got to try the fig ice cream courtesy of Hussain and enjoyed that too. All in all, and not to sound like the CBG groupies that we are, it was the usual great experience for us. We even got presents which was a nice touch ... thank you for those!!

We settled on Xander\u0027s since a couple of people have recommended it and it has a courtyard where we could sit outside and the little one could putter around. As it turns out the courtyard was swarming with flies so that was a non-starter and we moved indoors. The decor was nice and the staff courteous and friendly. My daughter loved the Christmas Tree and got a complimentary chocolate which she scarfed down in no time. I was a little disappointed with the menu selection which seemed limited and at first I couldn\u0027t really find anything that took my fancy, however when a couple of plates of fish and chips wafted by for the neighbouring table, both my wife and I were tempted since it looked like genuine battered english-style fish and chips.\n\nThe service was swift, but as it turns out the fish was very poor. It just tasted off somehow (my wife claimed one of the pieces she got tasted fine so it may have been the fish was a bit old - I\u0027m not sure) and the tartar sauce was also strangely sour - I\u0027m not sure if that was because of something in it or it was also getting on in age. The quantity of the fish was nothing to write home about but since neither of us liked it that wasn\u0027t an issue. The fries were standard mon salwa type stuff and in good quantities. We regretted not getting different dishes, though as I said earlier I wasn\u0027t too impressed by the diversity of the selection. We unanimously decided to forgo desert at Xander\u0027s and go elsewhere instead (ended up going to Hotspot where the desert was great as usual but the experience slightly spoilt by a table-full of 14 year-old girls smoking like chimneys).\n\nBut as it turns out our troubles at Xander\u0027s weren\u0027t over. I paid by credit card but was told by the cashier that they were getting an error and it wasn\u0027t charged. So I paid in cash but then checked my phone to see I had received an sms from the credit card company saying it had been charged. I showed the msg to the staff who said I should ignore it since it hadnt been charged. I called the card people who confirmed it had been and informed the staff. To cut a long story short it took over 20 minutes to sort the matter out by which time the kids were going stir-crazy and I had a splitting headache. The problem probably wasn\u0027t the staff\u0027s fault and they were courteous throughout but it made the whole experience all the more disappointing. When my wife asked me later if I\u0027d ever want to go again I thought I wouldn\u0027t completely rule out the idea but probably not for a full meal.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-25T11:26:15+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-26T06:46:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1359810443","name":"Nuria Munir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM1OTgxMDQ0Mw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTM1OTgxMDQ0Mw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"283942944990196","from":{"name":"Nida Huq","id":"850419690"},"message":"I agreed with you.

The masala dossa is also pretty decent and the Spicy Chicken Boti Bun has a unique flavour (be cautioned its really really spicy).  They also make a  great faluda and the cold-stone ice cream (which they call as Katakat Ice Cream) is very good for the price.  Love their dark chocolate flavour and have it  \"Katakated\" with Soft Mints with a topping of chocolate sauce.  They serve the Katakat Ice Cream in a waffle cup which is crispy and delicious.  A whole variety of ice cream flavours is available to suit all tastes. Cool Inn is a must visit place for all Chaat lovers.  Its great value for money.  The owner Noor Bhai is always present there and ensures quality and hygeine.  All their chutneys are made with mineral water and cooking/frying is done in Soya Supreme/Rafhan Corn Oil.
