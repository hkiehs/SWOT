And why not! I have been a regular customer for over a year and I think a tribute cum review is overdue now. \n\nIf I look back over the last one year, my eating out pattern has remained fairly lopsided! While I enjoy trying out new places and make sure that I visit them at least once for the sake of experience, there are some places I tend to frequent pretty regularly. One such place which I have, perhaps, visited the most in last one year, is Loginn Lounge. \n\nI am so used to visiting the Lounge that if I am unable to for a couple of weeks, I feel something is missing out of my life! To me Loginn Lounge is like home. I hardly feel as comfortable and at ease anywhere else. One big reason for my loyalty to the Lounge is Najam bhai, the man behind the place. Its not just the amazing food that the Lounge has to offer but Najam bhai’s personalized attention, care and great company that motivates frequent repeat visits. I am sure many will vouch for me on this one!  \n\nIn my case, whenever I am eating out by myself, my destination is almost invariably Loginn Lounge. Its like what they say in Urdu, “Mulla ki daur Masjid tak”. Loginn Lounge offers good food, consistent quality and affordable prices. But what sets it apart is Najam bhai himself. If he’s not there, I wouldn’t perhaps enjoy as much. The gap shap over food is what makes the experience all the more enjoyable. Besides being a great host, he is a good conversationalist and knows how to make his guests comfortable. \n\nService at Loginn is always impeccable with Najam bhai supervising every order himself. I am a huge fan of Loginn Lounge’s food. Burgers, sandwiches and pasta are top notch. Big Log burger and Loginn Special Club Sandwich need special mention. They are a must try. If you haven’t as yet, you don’t know what you’re missing out on! Sumptuous and delicious to the last bite, they make you want to have more.. and more! If only the appetite allows you to devour as much! Spicy crispy fries are my favorite and I must always have them. Sometimes that is the only thing I want! I have a particular liking for Spicy Ladies (no pun intended) :) . Try them out yourself but be prepared for a hot gastronomic joyride! Loginn recently introduced mango shakes. Make sure you take the large one!! Its too good! I have been wanting to go to the Lounge and have just mango shake and spicy crispy fries but each time I end up ordering a burger or a sandwich or even pasta! Such is the temptation when one enters the Lounge! \n\nNajam bhai a big thank you for Loginn Lounge and for being the wonderful host that you are! You know the Lounge is now a part of my life and I hope it remains so for as long as I am in the city :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-17T07:44:34+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-17T20:34:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"632765968","name":"Waqar Zubair"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Can I just say, wow! I initially wanted to go to Flo, but everyone else wanted to try something new. So I suggested Forty4 (I secretly wanted to try out the steak with the cacao reduction). Let me tell you, from the moment we entered the door, to the time we left, the staff was attentive without being obtrusive, we were made to feel comfortable, and throughout our meal we felt right at home and relaxed. \nOn to the food. We first ordered the prawn dim sums, which was loved by everyone, specially with the chilli wali sauce in the middle of the sauce trio we were served with it. The bread basket and garlic herb butter was devoured within moments, and the complimentary chicken mousse (I think) and the crostini with the deeelliiiccciiioouusss stuff on top was yummy. There was a serving of chicken stuffed with mushrooms and jalapenos, served with a parmesan sauce which was well-received, and the Forty4 pasta was also thoroughly enjoyed. Now, I usually take a bite of everyone\u0027s food to get a feel of how everything was overall, but I enjoyed my prime cut beef tenderloin with dark chocolate reduction scented with tarragon, medium of course, that I couldn\u0027t pull away from my food long enough to taste everyone else\u0027s! I did make sure to save space for the famous bread and butter pudding with raisins and banana ice cream, and man, oh man! SO worth the calories! The toffee sauce on top of the pudding was scrumptious (I scraped some off the top with my spoon. I know. Mean), but everything combined was sensational! Oh, and I also ordered the white lady. It was like a pina colada, with lychee and a strong pineapple flavor. I loved it! Went perfectly with my meal. Forty4 is definitely worth a visit, and is brilliant every single time. Non-pretentious, comfortable atmosphere, attentive, unobtrusive staff and a dinner worth having. A complete package, I must say.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-17T19:07:38+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-17T20:29:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NjY1MDkxODIw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"413920868659069","from":{"name":"Asfandyar Kazi","id":"100001551157304"},"message":"i had shit experience there when they recently opened..and never went there again.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-17T19:30:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"413921175325705","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"You need to revisit!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-17T19:31:18+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"413936611990828","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Yes Asfandyar Kazim, You seriously need to re-visit.

I feel it\u0027s imperative that the starter section be absolutely spot on because it sets the mood, so it shouldn\u0027t be something like what your ghar ka bawarchi churns out on a day he needs a dressing down. For the main course, my companion\u0027s beef tenderloin with chardonnay sauce was ok, but nothing to write home about. However, my pan-seared sea bass prawns was very good, albeit it was all sitting in a veritable lake of butter. The accompanying cajun-spiced prawns were also delicious although I honestly didn\u0027t detect anything cajun about the spices. So all in all, a very mixed experience and given the rather high prices, I was expecting a more consistent standard.

At times they can see tiny blue black fibres under their skin regrowing themselves and resulting in ugly lesions. In some cases , they have found those fibres shedding out of their skin and on to their beds.\nMENTALLY, It Can lead to a delusional state of mind , memory loss, hallucinations and death as well.\n\nPeople who have morgellons are usually accused of being crazy and imagining things.
