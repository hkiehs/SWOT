White Karhai was not up-to the mark, it was dry with very little spice, but Chicken boneless Handi was amazing. Divine taste. Ambiance was as usual perfect. Perfect weather for superhighway. Sat there for a while after the meal in a very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere.Al-Habib\u0027s  food is always a fun, relaxing drive on highway.

Let me first start of by saying that my nana was born in Burma so khaowsway has been an integral part of our family meals for many a years for a lot of generations.....I can have khaowsway for breakfast, lunch, dinner, midnite snack, etc in the same day for a whole week!  The gravy was nice but a lill too salty, decent amount of chicken.  The noodles are not what I was expecting since I always have had it with flat egg noodles, so texture n flavor from that aspect was a miss. Good variety of condiments, however I was missing coriander since I always eat ALOT of it wid my khaowsway. The crispy things were a nice addition, but I\u0027m use to eating rice \u0027far faar\u0027 (don\u0027t know what else to call it) with it. My only question to Burma House is if their chilly is vegetarian or was it wid sea food?? Cause I have allergies and have to be careful.   But over all.....MUCH MUCH MUCH better than Simple Dimple.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-04T13:20:21+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"310479905669833","from":{"name":"Tasneem Abbas","id":"588680855"},"message":"Zehra A.
