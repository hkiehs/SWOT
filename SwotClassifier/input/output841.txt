The ambience is dominated by dim lights and warm colours that give a welcoming feel as soon as one enters the restaurant. \n\nWe skipped the starters and went right on to the mains.I was in the mood for a non meaty, desi dish and opted for vegetable thali. Friends ordered chicken tournedo and Tokyo fish. My thali was perfect to fulfill my craving for desi food! It had white rice, palak paneer, daal, pakora curry, potatos, achaar and raita along with halwa and puris and crisp papads! The daal was a little bland and did not taste the way I was expecting it to. However, that was the only slight flaw in an otherwise spectacular dish which is a great option for vegetarians.\n\nMy friend seemed reasonably satisfied with her order of Tokyo fish. I never like ordering a chicken dish because usually it gets dry and tasteless but the few bites of Chicken tournedos that I had from my friend’s plate made me change my views about chicken. It was juicy and packed full of the most amazing flavours. Our server had recommended this dish and the way he described it made us hungry. Will definitely be having it again! The dark chocolate sabayon was the perfect dessert to end our meal. It had the right balance of sweet peaches and dark chocolate. \n\nOne thing that really matters to me is service. The staff here has been trained to stay attentive and to give helpful suggestions when asked. We sat for quite a while even after the bill had been paid and were not rushed in any way. I would definitely be going to The Patio again to try out more dishes and ofcourse, to have their chicken tournedos :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-22T15:43:28+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-22T16:27:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"682241004","name":"Atif Malik"},{"id":"589485566","name":"Murwah Tariq-Atif"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"509507958","name":"Omair Ahmed"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjY4OTYxNDAz","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"402235639827592","from":{"name":"Danyal Achria","id":"582960575"},"message":"Alisa Zulfiqar Thanks a lot for trying us out and were extremely glad you and your friends had a good time and enjoyed the food.
