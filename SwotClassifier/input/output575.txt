I had a major cupcake craving and so I was looking forward to some indulgence but sadly I was not impressed. I\u0027m not a huge chocolate fan so I got a red velvet and a vanilla buttercream. First of all, the size of the cupcake was on the small side so I wasn\u0027t too happy with that. Second of all, the cupcake part itself didn\u0027t have much of a taste or flavor at all. The red velvet tasted too much of baking soda or something like that and the vanilla cupcake was totally flavorless. The worst part was the icing! It was crunchy!! I could actually crunch on the sugar. I  like smooth, fluffy, creamy icings on my cupcakes not crunchy ones!

At that moment no body knew about Kabab Rolls they were the one\u0027s who introduced and named KABAB ROLL to the people of Karachi... at first people didn\u0027t even knew how to open the wrapper of kabab rolls. After their unique taste and popularity they decided to come out of the market and go at a good location so they could promote their unique product to the world. So they rented the place where silver spoon snacks is located now in 1971. As they had a history in restaurants and food they were the 3rd generation in this business. Their Grandfather Late Amjud Ahmed started this business in india in 1910 and made his chains of Amjudia Hotels and Restaurants all over india in his hard worked 20 years and made his company the 1st muslim owned Limited Co. in india as Amjudia Pvt. Ltd. So after partition of the two countries his grand childrens Mojib, Khatib, Habib \u0026 Adib followed the tradition and opened the restaurants in karachi. After the big sucess of Silver Spoon Restaurant they needed a bigger place to accommodate and fulfill the needs of their beloved customers so they decided to shift to a bigger place and they shifted on the same road near jheel park and allied bank which was the REAL SILVER SPOON RESTAURANT. And they also opened another popular restaurant by the name of Mojib\u0027s Dinner near jheel park. As they shifted the place which is known as silver spoon snacks now was rented by someone else and due to the popularity of the previous business of silver spoon they decided to use the name as it is being used now since then, because in our country u cannot register the name any one can open a silver spoon anywhere in Pakistan without any affiliation. I wold like to ask Mr. Hammad Ur Rehman Awan that please stop misguiding people and by the way mr. awan how could u invent BIHARI KABAB untill or unless you are a behari as they are and they have a history to prove it. We know that you want people to think that you are the real Silver Spoon... Let the taste and quality and the product be the judge of that. Thank You..\n\nI am sorry if i have offended anyone but the truth is the truth!","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-03-20T07:06:13+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-20T12:35:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1655946149","name":"Imtiaz Merchant"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"100001073218879","name":"Talha Ahmed"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"703368408","name":"Irfan Ali Siddiki"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"1626883423","name":"Fatema Murtaza Lacewala"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTYyNjg4MzQyMw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTY1NTk0NjE0OQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"523569157694239","from":{"name":"Ayza Alvi","id":"551492961"},"message":"Why was mojib shut down , I want it back plz","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-20T08:39:58+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"523569707694184","from":{"name":"Luciferz Angel","id":"792470170"},"message":"Mojib\u0027s had the best grilled chicken cheese sandwich...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-20T08:42:42+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"523573921027096","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Thanks Talha Ahmed, in fact after the controversy of the other Silver Spoon claiming to be original, I had decided to go and meet Adib Sahib personally to know the history as I am friends with one of his relatives.
