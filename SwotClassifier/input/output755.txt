To Najmis sb\u0027s surprise i had decided to leave out all veggies and have the \u0027saada khushbu\u0027 burger, but thats only to taste and enjoy the actual burger and not the ghas phoos. I will definitely rate it in my top 5, If not top 3. Also had ordered the pepper steak, which was also superb. You can tell that extreme care is given to the meat being used at logg inn, because the steak also was nice and juicy. \nFor dessert i got a great lecture from the Don himself on fast food 101.
