Had been there probably 10 yrs back. Hadn\u0027t returned coz the dessert then wasn\u0027t anything special. Sadly last night it was the same. Had the chocolate cupcake, nutella crepe and plain cold coffee. The crepe was generous in size and really filled with nutella so my daughter loved it. The cupcake came with piping hot chocolate icing which slid off on to the plate as the cupcake reached our table. Looked like it had been microed right there. My daughter finished off the icing but the cupcake was tasteless and so dry that she left it and I had to have water to make it go down my throat. The cold coffee was like having thick cold fresh milk with a touch of coffee essence. Also left that. Bland and tasteless again. Judging by the clientele, mostly teeny boppers, it seems that food isn\u0027t really a priority. The idea seems to be to be a place for young kids to hang out. The decor is fun and casual and I can imagine young people going there for fun not for the food. Don\u0027t want to risk trying any of their other desserts as it seems like they have the fancy names but no taste.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-10T06:33:32+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-10T08:36:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"422651261119363","from":{"name":"Luciferz Angel","id":"792470170"},"message":"I love their apple crumble, and their roast chicken sandwich in sun dried tomato bread (just ask them to go easy on the mayo \u0026 butter)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-10T06:52:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"422652644452558","from":{"name":"Lailabano Ibrahim","id":"1399965023"},"message":"Their ice reams are really good \nI only go there for that \nOtherwise their food isn\u0027t that good","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-10T07:01:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"422653974452425","from":{"name":"Bushra Joyo","id":"1421223164"},"message":"The last time I went there I had one of their burger\u0027s and chocolate brownie with Ice cream.
