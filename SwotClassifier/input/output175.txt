I don\u0027t usually complain, but I think that we should mention this to the management. Maybe they can bring us some better food.  And i know it’s hard to write some negative comments. \nWith few friends \u0026 i decided to visit Sattar Buksh and finally we went yesterday night. We ordered food, Jhenga lala , Pena colada , fresh lime , hathora-mar some beef , and some other drink with sheesha (and load-shading even we just ask what is load-shading?).\nI am Very sorry to say about your management that where from you got this Idea to serve drink and then food! It is all, what your server told us \"our standard is to serve drink 1st and after that we’ll serve food\".\nFood is not like that as we were expecting........ Prawn curry was fine but rice was not, side salad was not fresh even. Beef was not with good seasoning, but Rice! I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it \u0026 serving was less than standard I must say that Quality of beef was good as very few Cafes have.\nAnd most funny thing that when we ask for bill, a guy came \u0026 ask what we had! Mean they don’t know what’s  going on!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-25T08:57:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-25T08:57:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"637216265","name":"Natasha Adnan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjM3MjE2MjY1","before":"NjM3MjE2MjY1"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_624096820974805","from":{"name":"Amynah Mehdi","id":"1379600424"},"message":"FREE HOME DELIVERY (for Clifton \u0026 Defense only)\nCall now! 3514-0956\n\nOnline Menu On Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Taco-El-Paso/171468419581393?id\u003d171468419581393\u0026sk\u003dapp_117784394919914","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-25T08:18:19+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-25T08:18:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"522705412","name":"Marvi Shah"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTIyNzA1NDEy","before":"NTIyNzA1NDEy"}}},"picture":"http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/1255472_10202110566590558_1599805317_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10202110566590558\u0026set\u003dgm.624096820974805\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_623836614334159","from":{"name":"Sohail Kamran","id":"1254183890"},"message":"Dear KFC ,\nZinger burgers suppose to be juicy, not dry \u0026 draughty.

It was basically pasta strips and mince. Definitely requires cheese and white sauce - a better recipe overall. Won\u0027t be ordering this particular item from the menu.
