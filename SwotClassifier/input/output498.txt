If you dont waste time on the road then you can have your evening tea at PTDC Motel in Bahawalpur. If you are staying at PTDC, they do a decent dinner as well but more adventurous food options are available inside Farid Gate and near fawara chowk. Next morning PTDC will do a good early breakfast for  you. If you are taking the detor off the N5 towards Kabirwala, Shorkot, Jhang to join the motorway from Faisalabad, then you can have lunch at Bhera services which has a number of options including a KFC, a Subway and a Berrylicious. You will reach Islamabad by sunset. My favourite eating places in Isloo are Omar Khayyam and Kabul also Polo Lounge and Des Pardes in Saidpur village. If you start early next morning then you can have lunch at Balakot, there is this place  by the Kunhar River just after you cross the bridge I dont remember the name but great Karahi. There will be a great temptation to stop at Abshar Cafe at Kawai to have tea/cold drinks and pakoras with your feet in ice cold mountain stream, but it would best left for the return journey if you are going all the way to Naran and not stoping at Shogran. Plenty of eating options at Naran but not many beyond the usual chicken karahi, for trout its best to eat at PTDC Naran, or at one of the Pine Park hotels in the valley (the best being the riverside property at Khania.
