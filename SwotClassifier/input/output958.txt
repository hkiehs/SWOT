The amount of potato salad accompanying each order was miniscule. And I mean about six tiny cubes of potato miniscule (I counted). The cake was as dry as yesterday\u0027s bread. As I haven\u0027t yet had any major problems with Espresso\u0027s dine in experience, I\u0027d wager this is a case of the restaurant treating delivery orders in a cavalier fashion because they know that home delivery customers can\u0027t complain on the spot and demand better quality and service.

But obviously he can see the comments and posts. Due to the last post on Xander\u0027s he hhas every right to correct the maligning comments so he inboxed me.\n\nI have to admit he makes sense. And all my times at Xander\u0027s have been great. Even when I got a creme brulee that could have been better, their service was impeccable.\n\nPlease read the email.\n\"Hi Nezihe, since I\u0027m no longer part of SWOT (i tried to comment to the pizza thing) i can\u0027t write back, which is fine. However i wanted to let you know what i was writing as even you seemed to believe what was written. This is nothing against you or SWOT since both have helped me for Xander\u0027s. So here it is...\n\nMany of you have not heard from me for a long time on this group...the reason for this is that although I am open to negative feedback (SWOT helped me determine that my food portions in the beginning were too small and helped me improve for example), i have heard even more \"ridiculous\" comments which i know are not true ranging from me the owner telling a customer off and bad-mouthing them because they had not ordered enough or were not willing to wait for a table (??!!) or my best and most trusted waiter throwing his pen and pad on the floor and storming off after arguing with a customer (CCTV footage shows that it never happened) etc etc. Unfortunately, my camera does not have a view of the pizza station, however, for those who wish to listen to me, i would like to say that these pizza\u0027s are being made on a trial basis and the 3 pizza\u0027s given to customers that day were sent under MY supervision, which means i was there throughout. I know, that my cook who has had experience working infront of guests before would never ever in his wildest dreams think of \"spitting\" on a pizza let alone \"blow\" on it before serving it. I may come across as arrogant by not believing a word of this, but i know that there\u0027s not even the slightest chance of that happening. Furthermore, how could a pizza that has caught fire and therefore charred and become black be served to a customer infront of the owner? This conversation can drag on, but i found it necessary to intercept this one time and explain. For those who don\u0027t believe me thats fine. I respect SWOT tremendously, for the constructive criticisms and feedbacks which help us restauranteurs improve our service and quality. However, sometime these have been distorted and exaggerated to proportions where one cannot take everything that is commented seriously!\"","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-17T18:47:03+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-18T13:19:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000519917560","name":"Fizza Shahid"},{"id":"1655946149","name":"Imtiaz Merchant"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"100002928478909","name":"Rabia Ahmed"},{"id":"1481817950","name":"Naila Naqvi"},{"id":"617680709","name":"Fatima Ali Rizvi"},{"id":"508588993","name":"Saroasha Eng"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002605916001","name":"Sadaf Munir"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"505248635","name":"Tanya Azmi"},{"id":"1039048992","name":"Camilla Asmatullah"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"764425006","name":"Alisa Zulfiqar Zuberi"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100000226398562","name":"Irum Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwMjI2Mzk4NTYy","before":"MTAwMDAwNTE5OTE3NTYw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"298225660228591","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Alex you know the Tariff requirement for you to be back on the page.
