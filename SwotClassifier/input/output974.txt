Beautiful ambiance, perfect place for a quiet dinner, loved the lighting and the decor. \nService was exceptional, loved how Afroze Khan kept checking in on us and also gave us her input on our order, never have been treated so well at a restaurant in Karachi. Ordered the Beef Carpaccio, which I was not aware is the equivalent of sushi only with meat. Let\u0027s just say had I known I wouldn\u0027t have ordered, because I liked my food cooked. The bread basket was unbelievable. I had earlier read someone asking the Olivetto team how they keep the bread so warm and soft even after it arriving at the table, and that\u0027s exactly what I was wondering after every bite. For the main course we ordered the Moroccan Chicken and the Beef Tuscan. Both were extremely delicious,  did not lack flavor or taste. The serving sizes were way above what the average restaurants offer. I was full half way during the meal so I got it to go. Then came the desserts, the Chocolate Molten Lava and a complimentary bread pudding. Both desserts were heaven. But again had a small amount because I was already full, so got that to go aswell. Only hiccup you might say was that they didn\u0027t have the much talked about Pizza\u0027s available, which I was dying to have. But I guess that\u0027s a good thing because, now I can go back very soon for that. Thank you Team Olivetto.\n\nNext night decided to go with the bois to TUC. Was craving for the U.S Supreme burger, and it did not disappointing at awwl. Ahh, it was as juicy as Megan Fox. Very consistent taste. This time had it with the bran bun which was fresher than the white bun I had last time. Told the waiter to hold the coleslaw, because last two times I ended up wasting it because I don\u0027t like it, who took the instructions well. Service was pretty good.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-09T06:48:15+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-09T15:55:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"677666360","name":"Fazal Gafur"},{"id":"100000391823197","name":"Farah S.
