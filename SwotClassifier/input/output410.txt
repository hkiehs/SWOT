But, this time I went with my mother. Now, I\u0027ve tried their Chapli Kebabs, Nihari and all the Heaven/ Hell burgers, which is the good stuff, so I wanted something different. Anyway, here\u0027s my review:\n\nMind you, I\u0027ve had amazing experiences before of this place. Nobody came to take the order, so I had to make a shout to the waiter to do so. -__- Then, as we were sitting, I just took the lid off the sugar pot, and out poured a gazillion ants. I didn\u0027t create a fuss or anything, and since I didn\u0027t take my phone, there are no pictures. However, the guy took the pot away and cleaned it up. \n\nMom ordered Fish and Chips, and I, bereft of choice, went for the Rooster Steak, which I was informed was the larger version of the Chic Steak. Didn\u0027t get the espresso shots. We also ordered fries. The first set of fries came earlier than the meal, and they were fine. Mom really liked her fish and chips too. But, the steak was a real disappointment. Being a steak lover, I was hoping for the same level or at least close to what we get at Roasters or Flo. Sadly, for the upsized version which was served on a humongous platter, I got two very thinly cut strips of chicken, with a dip that was just way too much compared to the \u0027steak\u0027. The price? Same as what you\u0027d pay at Roasters for a good steak (Wild Mushroom/ Monterrey Chicken). I fail to visualize the size of the smaller one. Then, midway through the meal, I ordered more fries, which came very late. We had long finished the meal, and since there wasn\u0027t a sign of the fries, I called the guy. He said \u0027fries mei hi subse ziada dair lagti hai\u0027, which was really confusing. Anyway, they arrived twenty minutes after the meal had finished and nobody was in the mood to eat by then. \n\nSo, in a gist, the fries were great, the fish and chips were great, but steaks aren\u0027t their strongest suit. Serving times were tremendously slow this night. And, nobody likes being greeted by ants the minute you sit down on a table. And, that\u0027s all. I hope Quddusi Sahab takes notice and they improve their standards, without letting complacency become a factor. Cheers, y\u0027all.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-10T18:42:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-10T19:17:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"671250001","name":"Noman Iqbal"},{"id":"100000420764459","name":"Sana Shakir"},{"id":"604074782","name":"Farheen Jeelani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA0MDc0Nzgy","before":"NjcxMjUwMDAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"583393721711782","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"noted with concern, both issues will be sorted out tomorrow, really sorry to read, i was around but pre occupied for tomorrow, will get back to you, plz apologies to yr mother from my side","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-10T19:14:46+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"583394268378394","from":{"name":"Najm Ahmed","id":"885480695"},"message":"Yes, I saw you behind the counter.
