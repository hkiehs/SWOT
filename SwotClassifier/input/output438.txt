Wicked blend flavor. I had such high hopes about broadway pizza. Turned out to be a let down. For one the thin crust seemed like a thick crust. It was too oily. TOO MUCH CHEESE. And on top of that it was really really bland. Even though I made sure I told them I need extra spice. All in all it was a poor experience. Will not be ordering it again.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-29T15:56:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-01T01:24:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"508455820","name":"Fatima Arif"},{"id":"667511058","name":"Mohsin Makki"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100002509519038","name":"Rabia Tariq"},{"id":"571952596","name":"Shaarmeen Chughtai"},{"id":"631490154","name":"Nadia Patel.Gangjee"},{"id":"100001782272126","name":"HaNni Raja"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNzgyMjcyMTI2","before":"NTA4NDU1ODIw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"578250838892737","from":{"name":"Faizan Mukarram","id":"1023815310"},"message":"i would kill to have \"too much cheese\"","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-29T16:48:57+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"578253068892514","from":{"name":"Salik Aleem","id":"516138880"},"message":"^except that it was bland.
