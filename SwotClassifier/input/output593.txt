No lines, except for the one lady who was with her kids infront of me, i was surprised that my order was processed before hers. (Got some stares from her as she watched me chomp my order before hers) Decent packaging contained  the freshly made burgers with a nice bun, No Onions as promised..... tasted somewhat like Mr Burger.... (or what little i remember of it), Nice Thick fries, a little too salty for me, but well cooked. Id give the total experience a 6.5/10 . Rs 330 for the Burger Deal which inclided a drink and fries. Asked to know who the owner was as i wanted to point out some issues, but the server refused to disclose his identity saying they\u0027d had issues with some \"Pathans\" in the recent past......
