Turned out to be a great choice - the cake was moist and stuffed full of walnuts (and I love walnuts); the coffee flavour came through well - unlike the Bombay Bakery cake now where the sponge has no taste anymore (at least the ones I\u0027ve got from Karachi supermarkets). The icing was sinfully rich - sweet and coffeeish. Personally I prefer my cake with a lighter dab of icing but for most I think that would work rather well. Thanks Marylou.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-01T08:03:18+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-04T04:52:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ2NjY0NTM4","before":"MTQ0MjI3MTY4Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"390164344368055","from":{"name":"Aruna Sujanani","id":"691887360"},"message":"Shagufta, I would just like to point out to you that Bombay Bakery cakes are not sold anywhere in Karachi.

Mushroom and chicken bowl was probably the best dish on the table, delicious combination of flavors and its pasta..so def a hit! \n\nBut the worst bit was the small piece of hair in my last bite which i almost almost ate. Huge turn off ! I hope the management can take notice of that.\n\nWent to cinnabon after that..and guess what. Another tiny strand of hair in my mini chocobon, either its the hair shedding season or the chefs forgot to wear their caps today. \n\nWould really appreciate if all the food places could take notice of this and make sure their chefs wear proper chef hats while cooking. \n\nAlso, cinnabon was a bit of a disappointment.
