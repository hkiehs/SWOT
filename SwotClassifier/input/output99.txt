Well this time my experience was the complete opposite.\n\nAs usual they didn\u0027t have the Angus Steakhouse. (-_-)\n\nOrdered Two Double Woopers with cheese and one Chicken Mc.Royale. \n\nI still stand on what I wrote previously about The Chicken Mc.Royale. It is still the saddest and driest burger ever known to man. It\u0027s drier then the sahara desert. The lettuce this time was fresh though. \n\nThe Whoopers are a complete different story! I can easily say they tasted very close to the international taste. Was fresh, juicy and perfectly cooked. \n\nThe fries were better at the Sea View branch. The ones over here tasted very average.\nI\u0027m surprised at the taste difference in both the branches of the same place. Burger king needs to work on consistency.\n\nPlus I noticed the staff at the Nishat branch is better trained. They are quite helpful with selection and we were told that the Chicken Royale would be on the dry side.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-11-09T15:12:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-09T22:27:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"782634552","name":"Sibtain Raza Rizvi"},{"id":"100000522564819","name":"Imran Bahadur"},{"id":"100000000311471","name":"Zeeshan Mirza"},{"id":"100001010415651","name":"Why Khan"},{"id":"626070061","name":"Salman Aly"},{"id":"770944605","name":"Hasnain Hanif"},{"id":"622340233","name":"Imran Ahmad"},{"id":"571357266","name":"Khurram Zameer"},{"id":"531081230","name":"Jaipal Metai"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100001072766153","name":"Akbar Marri"},{"id":"558178102","name":"Safoora Fahad"},{"id":"100000968320453","name":"Umair Ali Khokhar"},{"id":"1037741430","name":"Shahan Khan"},{"id":"100001915683645","name":"Kanza Hussan"},{"id":"100001660620072","name":"Shumail Rafi"},{"id":"1475984626","name":"Shoaib Mohammad Quraishi"},{"id":"100000744651030","name":"Farah Sadiq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzQ0NjUxMDMw","before":"NzgyNjM0NTUy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"647463431971477","from":{"name":"Ahmed I Mehanti","id":"653913361"},"message":"Okay so it\u0027s a Whopper*","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:06:38+0000","like_count":12,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647464341971386","from":{"name":"Rayyan Sohail","id":"728987421"},"message":"\"Mc.Royale\" ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:09:48+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647465135304640","from":{"name":"Irfan Mohammad Aslam","id":"861405103"},"message":"Ayesha Khan happy iqbal day :P iqbal jee hotay to apki nazam parh kar buhat kush hotay !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:12:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"647465148637972","from":{"name":"Ibrahim M Khalil","id":"724095104"},"message":"WTF is this?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:12:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647465825304571","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Ahmed I Mehanti grammer Nazi much lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:15:34+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"653913361","name":"Ahmed I Mehanti","type":"user","offset":0,"length":15}]},{"id":"647466138637873","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Rayyan Sohail I meant chicken royale.
