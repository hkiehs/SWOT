No worries, we were seated downstairs, in a corner. Five minutes later I saw a large group of people going upstairs- its offputting, to say the least..\nSecondly, they had advertised hummus, falafel, cholay, fruit chat, wontons n a couple other items for iftar - we got a sum total of 3 falafels, 2 wontons, a bowl of fruit n a bowl of chanas  and a small bowl of dip. We got pita bread after ten minutes, when we asked for it. I looked around n tables with 2 had the same amount as tables w 6 persons.  We asked for some more and they said this was it. Oh well.\n Ordered the starters and entrees. Starters were alright, salad was fresh but drenched in olive oil. Entrees were the main disappointment. Seemed they\u0027d pre-prepared the chicken and just poured sauce over before serving it because it was cold. Plus the portions are small. My Father-in-law\u0027s a big man and I\u0027m pretty sure his appetite was not satiated. I\u0027m pretty sure he had 2 mangoes when we got home :-o\nThe only saving grace, if any, was the lindt brownie - that was good though, not great.\nWhile the deal seems like value for money, it really isn\u0027t if you come back disappointed and wishing you\u0027d spent a thousand bucks more for a better meal and experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-19T11:04:56+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-19T13:31:25+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"425747437476412","from":{"name":"Saman Qureshi","id":"538235440"},"message":"That sucks - I love deli so I\u0027m disappointed to hear that their quality is going down so badly.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-19T11:19:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"425773864140436","from":{"name":"Maheen Khan","id":"500688858"},"message":"FALAK!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-19T13:31:25+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDI1NzczODY0MTQwNDM2","before":"NDI1NzQ3NDM3NDc2NDEy"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_425770737474082","from":{"name":"Roomana Nasir","id":"529620428"},"message":"Need bistro 76 number PLEASE!
