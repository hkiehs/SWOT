I am sorry but I dont agree with you on this.\nLets go step by step.\nStarting with Sajjad Restaurant taking only spill over crowd ? I think Sajjad and Kolachi both come under the same league. Everyone has a different taste but at the same time I think Sajjad has a good fan following and many loyal customers. Plus its a bigger restaurant so it can absorb more walk in customers. \nNext is food.\nYour food can be written as creatively as you want. If you want a chicken dhaka (one of their most popular dish) to be just some average chicken pakora then be it. It can at the same time be crispy fillets of breast chicken batter coated and fried to perfection, served with fries onion rings and sauces, the perfect start to your meal.\n\nIn the same way even the best of karhais for you might be a handful of botis cooked in a karhai, with tomatoes and green chillies.\nWhat I also didnt understand was the fact that following your list of complains it was written that the it was not bad. No smell in the meat and it was tender and cooked in the right way.\nSo was it good or bad ???\n\nAnyhow I wish you a speedy recovery from your medical condition and I hope you enjoy the meal.\nCheers","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-19T18:31:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606013989449755","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Razak Latif first of all Aamir Basrai is the last person to give a false account of his experience.
