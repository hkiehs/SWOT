Ordered half cheese \u0026 Tarzan chicken Chicago style pizza with heavy sideline, drink \u0026 sauces. We gave it a try and were not disappointed. It had plenty of cheese \u0026 ingredients. You\u0027d lift up a slice and long threads of mozzarella cheese pull out. Moreover, it is greatly filling per slice. So yeah.. Give them a shot! :)","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-06-29T17:16:55+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-29T17:20:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"706770021","name":"Fariha Tungekar"},{"id":"576566743","name":"Anam Ashraf"},{"id":"100002509519038","name":"Rabia Tariq"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwOTIwMTAyMjgx","before":"NzA2NzcwMDIx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"578260502225104","from":{"name":"Ahmed Affan","id":"509910007"},"message":"Farvå Patel \"PAID\" \u003dD","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-29T17:20:19+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"736055654","name":"Farvå Patel","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTc4MjYwNTAyMjI1MTA0","before":"NTc4MjYwNTAyMjI1MTA0"}}},"picture":"http://photos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t1/1011835_147680508756009_981993005_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d147680508756009\u0026set\u003dgm.578259498891871\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_578260305558457","from":{"name":"Zarmina Kadir","id":"706695454"},"message":"Vanilla Almond Cake","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-29T17:19:43+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-29T17:19:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"670615540","name":"Khurram Wahab"},{"id":"100002293771856","name":"Talhah Shaikh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyMjkzNzcxODU2","before":"NjcwNjE1NTQw"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_578245788893242","from":{"name":"Noor Mukaty","id":"596730494"},"message":"Going to Studio Cafe ...... any recommendations ( NO SEA FOOD)?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-29T16:36:46+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-29T16:36:46+0000"},{"id":"165861103465048_578235438894277","from":{"name":"Shaikh Anas Jamal","id":"100000378046166"},"message":"Want to have a dinner wid family tonite.....any suggestions?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-29T16:15:33+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-29T16:15:33+0000"},{"id":"165861103465048_577753972275757","from":{"name":"Aleena Rehan Khan","id":"866440384"},"message":"Extremely urgent..

The disappointing part was the main course apparently the thai chow mien means a spicier version of Chinese chow mien. Than the real disappointment I am sure almost anyone been to Ginsoy must have had the cherry chilli chicken so I ordered it in RE as well there was no gravy it was fried dry chicken and instead of canned cherries or fresh cherries they had used the sugary type of cherries that you use in cakes which gave the whole dish a very weird sweetish kick. \n\nService was also good something Teamginsoy Ginsoy needs to take a lesson from as when in rush hours the service is not upto the mark.\n\nPricing was also similar to Ginsoy you can have half portions as well but that makes me question if I want Chinese why not go to Ginsoy ?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-28T09:40:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-29T14:52:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d","before":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"577638808953940","from":{"name":"Sana Abdullah","id":"627747302"},"message":"For service and ambiance.

However we\u0027d like to clarify a couple of things. Firstly we are not in the market to compete with Ginsoy. We have no comparison with Ginsoy as they\u0027re serving Extreme Chinese and we\u0027re serving Hakka Chinese. Hakka Chinese is a distinct cuisine of Chine which is acquainting the market, at the moment. The names may be similar to our competitors but we\u0027re solely striving for our identity and not being a substitute for other eateries. The prices have been set to what matches our costing and market, nor an \u0027at par\u0027 comparison with Ginsoy. There is nothing \u0027wannabe\u0027 about it if our ambiance depicts the name we\u0027ve given to our eatery. We\u0027re serving food to please customers like you and that would remain our first and foremost priority. Hope to see you soon while we\u0027ll make sure your next experience is a better one:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-29T10:27:10+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"590540852","name":"Abdul Shakoor Motiwala","type":"user","offset":6,"length":22}]},{"id":"578175918900229","from":{"name":"Abdul Shakoor Motiwala","id":"590540852"},"message":"How kind of you hakka red emperor, your service n ambiance was pretty good.
