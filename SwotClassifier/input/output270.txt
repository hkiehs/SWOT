But lets think like this,  many from these poor flood effected people might be involved in this restaurants food and supply chains, working there, selling supplies, or growing produce or involved in maintaining the establishments.

You know in orgsnizations  and businesses including restaurants if their employes are effected by any crises, they are helped, a better advice to us on this page would be keep patronising the eateries as well as spare some resources to feed victims.
