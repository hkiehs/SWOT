A non-pretentious dining place in Zamzama, serving clean flavorful food at a reasonable price.  The place does suffer from an identity crisis, but that does not have any effect on the quality of food served.\n\nOrdered Boneless Chicken Karhai, Club Sandwich, and Meethi Puri.  The Chicken Karhai was delicious, with the masala having a clean distinct flavor, with minimal oil.  It may not be the best Karhai in the city, but it certainly is one of the cleaner ones.  Club Sandwich was filling, and wasn\u0027t really loaded with useless assortments -- just the right mix of all ingredients.  I\u0027m the last person to care about hygiene, Methi Puri had that tangy flavor, and is a good option (albeit at a price) for hygiene freaks.\n\nWith a cost of PKR450 per head for three people looking for a light flavorful dinner -- Cafeela is the place to be.  The only downside: the menu is fairly limited -- something like Menu of the Day, or availability of new dishes every week might do the trick.  And yea, unlike other places in the vicinity -- the place had sufficient lighting to ensure that the patron doesn\u0027t go blind while reading the menu, or eating the meal.\n\nRecommended for a clean, flavorful, and a pocket friendly experience.\n\nOverall Rating -- 8/10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-15T11:56:23+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-15T19:15:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"100002850760185","name":"Nayab Ali"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"646760193","name":"Rehma Tirmizey"},{"id":"821064236","name":"Talha Iftkhar"},{"id":"628102086","name":"Rehman Ray Saiyed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI4MTAyMDg2","before":"Njk1Nzc2Mzkz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619262154791605","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Great review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-15T18:54:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619268914790929","from":{"name":"Ammar Habib Khan","id":"685505866"},"message":"Thanks Hajra!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-15T19:15:03+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE5MjY4OTE0NzkwOTI5","before":"NjE5MjYyMTU0NzkxNjA1"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_619109544806866","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"How is Cafeela\u0027s Chinese ?
