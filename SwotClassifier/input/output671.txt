We had passed by Thai Express (on Shahbaz) many times, so as lovers of Thai cuisine, we figured that it was time to give it a try. \n\nAt first glance, the menu seemed a bit modest, but they did have all the major fish, chicken and beef dishes that one would normally expect at a Thai restaurant. We ordered the prawn toast for starters, which was small but light and extremely tasty. We followed up with a main course of chicken green curry and chicken stir fry with vegetables served with steamed rice. We topped off the meal by sharing an apple crumble for dessert.\n\nI must admit, the food exceeded my expectations. Not only was it authentic and extremely flavorful, unlike some other Thai restaurants, the food wasn’t overly spicy. In fact, I ordered a chili sauce on the side which amped up the flavor tremendously. Dessert could have been better, but did not take away from the overall dining experience. The service was quick and the waiters were attentive and responsive. Ambiance was average, but no complaints. And with the lunch deal, it was great value for money (about Rs. 650 per head).\n\nI highly recommend Thai Express for lovers of exotic food and anyone who is looking for a unique and casual dining experience without the high prices and frills of the fancier restaurants.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-02T16:51:45+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-02T20:14:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"},{"id":"680337728","name":"Abbas Hussain"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQxNTk0MzIwMA\u003d\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"482039385180550","from":{"name":"Sadaf Yacoob","id":"619315634"},"message":"thats a rave review. my experience at Thai Express has always been really bad, and something i\u0027d rather forget than talk about.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-02T17:34:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"482096998508122","from":{"name":"Thai Thai","id":"100004535555147"},"message":"Hi Taimur, thanks for the lovely review.

Anyways, not to dwell into farewell depression, i tried my best to cover all eateries as i could. Summary and ranking goes like:\n\nNew places:\n1. Bella vita- great gelato and a very different pizza! Must visit\n\n2. Kolachi- full marks for ambience( despite 50min wait) and one if the best beef botis, though garlic rice were a big disappointment! Karahi was great!\n\n3. Olivetto- tried there pan asian prawns with rice! Sluurrpp! Veryyyyy nice and must try!\n\n4. Xanders- very nice tomato soup and calamari starter, but the menu lacked depth for dinner. Suggest it to be a breakfast/brunch place thn dinners. Ordered jalapeño chicken pizza but the staff mistakenly served margarita. But they were courteous and apologetic! Hence, forgiven.\n\nOldies which are still goldies:\n\nNo one can beat Zahid ki nihari with garam garam naan still!!!\n\nBots was supreme!! The food covered up for poor service! Honestly, once it arrived (prawn karahi, fried pangush fish, fried prawns)we forgot tht it took ages to get someone to clean the table and take thr order. Ad always, didnt disappoint at all.\n\nTai pan- suprisingly great lunch food! Unlike many years ago whn i went and got served with a bee in the soup :) but this time,everything was awesome.\n\nGlorias beef chilli wrap also was a fav this trip!\n\nBoat basin ka subah ka halwa puri had still maintained its \u0027to die for\u0027 value! The dhaba roadside fun i miss!\n\nNandos- lemme tell you this, pakistans nandos takes the prize of the best nandos around! The depth in menu and the taste is what makes it the best!\n\nDynasty- unfotunately trip to dynasty was marred by sudden bout of sickness, and getting all food packed without even looking- the other disappointment was one of the best hotels in town didnt have panadol in first aid, and the pharmacy hd closed at 9! Made me wonder, wat wud guests do if they needed it in middle of night.\n\nChairman mao- no compromise on quality- still the same good hot n sour soup, chicken schezuan and fried rice!\n\nChatkharay and gazebo- never fail to bring your taste buds alive with the bun kabab, chaat and qeema!\n\nAnddd pompei- blue cheese pizza rocks my socks :)\n\nYummmmm!
