We went to KhanJi at Port Grand. The first thing that struck us (in a good way) was that it\u0027s located at the farthest end of the walk and offers amazingly calm environment.. Our table was ready and it was right at the edge giving us a great view of the port and the light drizzle made the whole environment great..\n\nNow to food, having searched (Yes searched using the option on the top right of the group ;) ) the reviews of the place on SWOT we ordered Peshawari Karahi, Afghani White Karahi, Shish Touk, Chicken Namkeen Boti, and Mutton Ribs..Everything we ordered was ready on time, served hot and everyone loved the food.. They didn\u0027t have tandoori Naan in their menu but they granted our wish to serve Naan with the food and they arranged it from some other restaurant.. After the food we ordered Doodh patti and Kashmiri Chai which was really really good and was very refreshing since we all went there straight from work and really needed it..\n\nThe highlight of our experience was the attentiveness of their staff... From the manager who greeted us at the entrance to every waiter everyone was trying their best..\n\nOverall it was a 10/10 experience for us.. Excellent place..

Love to eat ….Specially Desi Ghee Stuff either its Karahi either its Fish or etc.\nUnfortunately the both guests by profession were Doctor’s even one of them was a highly known surgeon \n@ 9.25 I reached at kolachi before that I had “NO” reservation I thought its Monday so at Do Darya it will No Crowded at kolachi ..When I reached it was packed jam and on call it was 56# minimum 1 hour wait…\nI know the owner’s Owais very well and even Umair but both of them were not present suddenly I asked from a attendant who else is looking after him. He took Mr.Amir Name I want to that guy directly and I just simply request him that we are four people and I have guest from Lahore and I called Awais for the reservation however I was dishonest  itna to chalta hai na yar!\nYou know what he did he moved us all the way on a prime location on top which was really WOW. It was full moon yesterday and the view was extremely awesome don’t have words to express. \nI order Fish, Grilled BBQ Prawns, Chicken Reshmi Kabab,Peshawari Karahi,….\nThe best part was they served in once and it was well maintained in temperature, Quality \u0026 quantity \nThe Guest was impressed by the Fish Taste!  Usually they had fry fish in Lahore ,Sardar or Bashir Darulmahi wala are best in Lahore but again the difference was fresh water and a Sea Fish.\nI was stunned by the service standards the best part was after every 5-10 minute there was one new attendant coming and asking need anything else sir, you liked the food etc. \nI strongly believe one should have to profuse with his service standards in a completion war either its taste either its services should have to up come with its own standard’s and have the raise the bar which I guess kolachi did in real.\nThe best part wow to WaoOOoo factor was I asked him for the bill which was 11,000 for four people I just had a pause that I took 6000 cash which I thought will be enough I was like Wooooffffffffffff I checked the bill again and call the waiter are you sure it’s mine twice he said “yes” Sir then I asked again politely just have another confirmation unfortunately the bill was exchanged with other table he made apology on this but I guess it was another great experience with Kolachi….\nOvais,Umair \u0026 Amir, Great Work Guys \nKeep the Bar high and for other Restaurant’s I don’t want you to get disappoint but dear all serious time to think!\nValue against Money !","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-20T09:02:23+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-21T07:01:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"685959051","name":"Ali Hasan"},{"id":"100001252885971","name":"Marium Sultana"},{"id":"1048532624","name":"Syed Nawfil Rahim"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"789225723","name":"Lalarukh Khursheed Farooqui"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"},{"id":"698359177","name":"Mashal Iftikhar"},{"id":"752330337","name":"Faiz Kazi"},{"id":"558178102","name":"Safoora Fahad"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg1NTA1ODY2","before":"NTI0NDc2NzM1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"606461179405036","from":{"name":"Noveen Siddiqui","id":"520455792"},"message":"Lovvvv this post!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T10:26:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606481659402988","from":{"name":"Syed Nawfil Rahim","id":"1048532624"},"message":"Kolachi make you say WOW!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T11:42:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606561942728293","from":{"name":"Huma Zunnoon Khan","id":"100000710303249"},"message":"wondering wat if the bill was correct ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T13:26:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606562169394937","from":{"name":"Huma Zunnoon Khan","id":"100000710303249"},"message":"* wld have been","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T13:27:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606568629394291","from":{"name":"Noveen Siddiqui","id":"520455792"},"message":"Huma kitni buri baat hai...
