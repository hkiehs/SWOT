Having read people complain about wait times we got there at 8:30 and the first course was served within 15 mins and we we were out of there at 930.\n\nStarted with the prawn biryani which was unbelievably good - asked the waiter to make it spicy and it tasted alot like indus biryani which I love except this was with prawns and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Next were fish fingers and grilled jumbo prawns which were also quite good. Ended with fish karahi and its gravy/masala tasted amazing but i did think the fish didn\u0027t seem like it belonged in the karachi as the taste wasn\u0027t exactly blending in. Nevertheless I would order that karahi again just for the flavor maybe next time with prawn or something. Infact i was thinking how amazing a chicken/beef karahi would taste with that masala!\n\nOverall great food and no complaints of wait time or anything - the menu is so vast that it will take a couple of more visits to really sample alot of things on it so look forward to the next visit!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-11T21:03:13+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-11T21:05:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100002594564883","name":"Tania Ali Raza"},{"id":"1640895663","name":"Javaria Javed"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"294544720596685","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Thank you Shah Sahib :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-11T21:05:48+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mjk0NTQ0NzIwNTk2Njg1","before":"Mjk0NTQ0NzIwNTk2Njg1"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_294370283947462","from":{"name":"Maleeha Jawaid","id":"785615314"},"message":"Going to BOTS today for the first time.
