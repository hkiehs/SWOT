My experience is as follows: Strong smell : The minute you enter the cafe there is a strong smell that greets you.I couldn\u0027t decipher if it was the smell of cane furniture or dampness. The gentleman who greeted us started spraying air freshener as soon as we sat down. Thus confirming that the smell would bother customers. Food: we ordered chicken quesadillas and Mexican sandwich and mint lemonade. The quesd. Were extremely spicy and the sauce too was way too hot for my taste. My hubby too who  has a very high threshold for spicy food could not eat them. They were not holding together and most of the stuffing was falling apart; The Mexican sandwich was floppy and again either the bread was not fresh or it was just a bad day cause it too was falling apart. The lemonade was good. The garlic bread served at the beginning was crispy and nicely done. Besides the food being the way it was we did enjoy the music. Although for a Saturday night we were the only customers there and it did make us wonder why?. Nonetheless I think there is opportunity to improve and I do wish them best of luck!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-19T18:52:22+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"414620298589126","from":{"name":"Abdul Basit Memon","id":"537798684"},"message":"the food sucks..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-19T19:23:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"414621761922313","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"ABM: Don\u0027t be unfair...using language like \u0027the food sucks\u0027 is unacceptable...this is someone\u0027s investment and bread and butter you so non-chalantly generalised...respect the food God puts in front of you and if you have any complaints with an eatery or the food they serve I am sure you can find a way to get the message to the proprietor of the establishment sticking within basic norms of politeness and not putting forward opinions that are synonymous with slang.
