Medium well - grilled to PERFECTION -melt-in-your-mouth juicy on the yummiest bun with sesame seeds - no GAANS POOS (as in raw onions, tomatoes, lettuce - sorry but YUCK) just ooozzing with perfectly grilled mushrooms (even HT admits that the quantity was more than usual - guess i am the chef\u0027s favorite - what can i say) a ramekin filled with jalapenos, with thin thin french fries - crispy and fresh. these burgers are quite a handful and thu they offered to cut it in half for me - i refused and took the first bite - had juices and mushrooms running down my chin!!!!! yes i know i am NOT 6years old - but that\u0027s the only way to eat a burger - after reveling in that moment - picked up the knife and fork and cut civilized bites and ate the whole thing (except i couldn\u0027t finish all the bun - but there was NO WAY i would have left that burger patty so i finished that.)\n\nfinished the meal with a shot of excellent espresso and a scoop of orange and basil sorbet.\n\noh man!!!!!!!!!! Zoya Khan you may make me run around a 5 mile track tomorrow - but tonight i had to deal with a foiled sushi plan!!!!!!! may all my foiled plans work out so beautifully well.\n\nforgot the coleslaw - which was sharp and sweet and very crunchy and thu i am wasabi fan - i don\u0027t like it on my BURGER - just a simple mustard - trust CBG to have the good english one - perfect sharpness for excellent beef tenderloin patty.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-16T21:32:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-17T13:56:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001798812076","name":"Anam Tariq"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"617680709","name":"Fatima Ali Rizvi"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"663022305","name":"Naziha Syed Ali"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"607378917","name":"Shah Jamal"},{"id":"724851212","name":"Mahvash Siddiqi"},{"id":"100000463819406","name":"Syed Aarij Iqbal"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTY0MDY5NzY0","before":"MTAwMDAxNzk4ODEyMDc2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"297699003614590","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"chargrilled beef","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-16T21:58:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"297699596947864","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"n I am jealous ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-16T21:59:40+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"297700273614463","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"oye you know The SWOT \u003c3 BOTS","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-16T22:00:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"297708703613620","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"what a slurpish review! \u003c3 im drooling","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-16T22:15:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"297710843613406","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Hajra go and have the burger tomorrow and if you are not in love - i will use one of my eight names for a week","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-16T22:19:25+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"297887820262375","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Nezihe - It was great having you over last evening!Really enjoyed ourselves too!!

Start by burning 150-200 calories and slowly and gradually over 2-3 months increase your burning and cutting down on the quantity of your food do not do anything over night and once in ten days keep a cheat day and have whatever you like :) oh and ya 2 glasses of fat free milk daily and green tea as well!

Of course, it would have been much better had we gone there to eat rather than picking it up because fresh, hot cinnabons are beyond compare.
