Out of the three drinks on the buffet - Rooh Afza, Lemonade and Tamarind Juice - the Tamarind juice was a winner for me. \n\nThe dinner buffet opened after an interval, and although the offerings were limited in variety, the taste was mind-blowing! Thai Chicken Curry, Beef Medallions in peppercorn sauce, and Fish \u0026 Crab Balls in Chinese Sauce were absolutely finger-looking good, and I wished I had held back on the iftar consumption a little to enjoy the dinner entrées more. The only glitch was that the garlic rice and chowmein took forever to reload and there were long gaps between refills of the rest of the entrées too, which led people to constantly hover around the buffet. \n\nThe desserts were an absolute delight as well. Chocolate Brownies, Cream caramel, Fudge Cake, chocolate balls, pineapple cake, and fresh fruits just made for a very indulgent end to the meal, and I even forgot about the Hazelnut Dream Cake that awaited us at home. :)\n\nThis, however, was not the end of the meal! Aman Virjee made a lovely gesture of sending us a complimentary Fudge cake slice with a candle on top and an anniversary wish piped with chocolate on the plate. (Remembered too late to take a picture!) Thank God for the tea that made some room for us to gobble the cake down. \n\nThe attentive service at Forty4 is like the icing on the cake! All of this made for a very lovely evening for our family.
