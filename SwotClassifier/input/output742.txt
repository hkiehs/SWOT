It was all packed and had to wait for more than an hour before getting seated. The waiters were not expecting such a large crowd on Eid day or probably were too relaxed and expecting the diners to go and get the food, as was the case during Ramadan\u0027s buffet, as we had to tell them at least twice or thrice if we needed anything. \nThe à la carte menu had a few items marked \" * \" or \" ** \" that supposedly referred to chefs\u0027 recommendations, however, the waiter did not know why were those items marked asterisk. The BBQ lacked taste and the meet used especially in Afghani Boti was neither fresh nor properly washed and cleaned. \nOne does understand that the service was slow due to the rush but compromising on quality of food was something not justified. \nI hope they work on this because the ramadan buffet has already raised up everyone\u0027s expectations.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-21T13:49:09+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-21T16:13:27+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"426463947404761","from":{"name":"Tania Danish","id":"657325696"},"message":"I went for dinner during Ramadan around tenish, it was jam packed but we got a table in half hr, but the view did justice to the wait.
