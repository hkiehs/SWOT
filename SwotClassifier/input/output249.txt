Again the same thing happened last night so I though oh hell I have to review it after receiving a few special items for feedback.\n\nOk so basically I\u0027ve had everything on the menu except for the Gado Gado Wrap, Sun Khao Suey and Gola Ganda. \n\nMy top favorites are :\n\nOhn-no Khao Suey (Classic) 10/10\n\nSeejet Khao Suey (Stir Fried) 10/10\n\nTofu Salad 8/10\n\nBeef Rengdand with Yellow Rice and 7/10\n\nSan-win makin 7/10\n\nI would recommend all of these dishes as they are comfort food and authentic Burmese recipes, as the owner of Mong Chow is Burmese and has a great passion for food and might I say its good to have a new cuisine in the market being done authentically. I just can\u0027t wait for more additions and then eventually a dine-in !\n\nHowever next to Farid\u0027s at Ocean Mall there is a little Mong Chow but I\u0027m not sure if they have all the items from the menu.\n\nLast night I ordered Mohinga \u0026 2 Ohn-no Khao Suey as a friend was over, we received the order before time as usual and received a dry balachaung and a paste balachaung as well. This is basically a Burmese prawn relish, I liked the paste one A LOT, it was spiced well and the flavor just burst in the mouth, I ate half the bottle with my khao suey. Once its available for purchase, I would recommend that it be tried at least once to make your own judgement call.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-27T15:43:28+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-27T16:17:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"510616368","name":"Omer Khuhro"},{"id":"759025230","name":"Hassan Jan"},{"id":"617601286","name":"Insia Iqbal"},{"id":"780381887","name":"Samar Husain"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg1NTA1ODY2","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"610431405674680","from":{"name":"Tahira I.

Its just amazing how Mr Big with Egg n Cheese is perfect every time . It feels like they have time frozen the entire process for the last 20 years . Succulent , Flavoursome , Juicy Satisfaction all wrapped up in One little Piece of Heaven. I\u0027d rate it 12/10 , 2 extra points for that smile on my face every time I take the first bite.\n\n2- Al Asif Square : Though a bit risky for some fellows but to be honest the place was packed . We had food at MADINA RESTAURANT which is located inside Al Asif Square and to some people\u0027s surprise there were few families around there as well ( well to do families at that ) enjoying food , the atmosphere was friendly we were greeted as warmly as always . We had the famous Dumba Boti , Afghani Pulao , Namkeen Gosht and Karahi.  Now i don\u0027t want to waste time in describing the brilliance of food . \nThat is the best Authentic Afghani food out there, Period , 11/10 . One extra point for the Afghan brethren for their every gracious hospitality. \n\n3- Tayyabi Restaurant : Located in Hussainabad. It one of the few unsung heroes of Karachi. We ordered Prawn Masala , KataKat , Chicken Chargha Fry, Malai Boti and Tikkas . Food was served a bit late as they prepare all the dishes fresh and from the scratch. \nPrawn Masala is one of the best in town as the prawns just melt in your mouth and mix with that zesty masala . THE DAMN ! \n\nKatakat and Chicken Chargha fry are good too . All in all yet another place you wont come out unsatisfied or cheated, EVER . 8/10 . -2 for the stolen side mirror of my friend\u0027s car from the parking :P\n\n4-  The Burger Shack: I have Shake Shack every week so it did not impressed me much. But i\u0027d like to commend the owner for doing the best damn possible thing by cloning a famous international franchise\u0027s menu and making it possible to offer taste in it as well. I was not disappointed to say the least. 7/10\n\n5- Cafeela : Simply put , Zahoor bhai you rock . Okra Jalfarezi , Malai Boti , Nathiya Gali Qeema , Shahi Tukray , Chicken Yakhni Pulao are all yum. One of the best value for money in town. \n\nI am a safe eater and a Desi at heart as I get to eat really yummy mum cooked food and these are few of the places I go to eat or get food delivered when I want to eat out. Flying out tonight . Will Miss Karachi as I always do .
