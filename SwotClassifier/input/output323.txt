Having been seated at reserved table for about 30-40 minutes and in the queue to order for about 25 the manager suddenly\"yelled we are close you may all go now, we are not serving anybody\". The queue had almost 910-11 people in waiting, and there were only 5 minutes to iftar. Considering how long the queue was, people started yelling and the manager disrespectfully said \"its closed we are not serving you may all go!\" with not even a gram of empathy or anything.\n\nIf you can\u0027t serve the people why let them sit there and wait in the queue for almost an hour.If your kitchen hasn\u0027t done prep for people you might as well close down the place or tell them you aint serving when they are entering.\n\nThankfully ESPRESSO downstairs was courteous enough to have us seated at their place at last minute and quickly made arrangements for 5 of us. (Even though we just dropped by in desperate times). Food was good and they truly won us over by their exemplary customer service.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-05T09:15:20+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-05T14:40:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.
