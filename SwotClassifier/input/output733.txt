As always, the service was attentive and gracious despite the place filling up rapidly after we got there. Interestingly enough, we were concerned that we had young Mr. Ali with us but we were in good company with a variety of families with children of all ages. Says something about the comfort level of parents with the place! However I must point out that we are talking about an early dinner, like 7.15ish so that may have had something to do with it. We also hurried the delivery of the meal due to Mr. Ali Masood\u0027s presence and the staff made it happen!!\n\nThe Blue Cheese souffle might have been the best we have ever had at CBG and of course, we had to order two to ensure we got our fix properly! My steak was nicely cooked with all my usual idiosyncrasies catered for as were the two chicken dishes ordered by Mariyam Masood and her mother\n(Chicken with Jalapeno Cream, Chicken with Grain Mustard). Consistently medium rare steak is difficult to achieve but CBG has always managed to get it done with maybe a rare exception somewhere in the distant past. As a steak lover, that is one thing that I appreciate tremendously!\n\nOn a hunch, I ordered the Pomegranate juice for Mariyam and she thought it was very very good. While I took off to the car with Ali, Mariyam and Amma polished off a molten lava despite being quite full after a robust meal.\n\nSufficed to say, we satisfied our craving and had a wonderful evening at CBG once again. Unfortunately we missed Hussain Tariq since he was busy taking care of his unwell father but I did get the chance to speak to him today to share that we had a great experience at CBG once agein. We are looking forward to the updated menu coming up in the near future and shall be back to indulge again!
