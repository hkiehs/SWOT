The pizza was simply HEAVENLY! It was just amazing! They have earned the title of best pizza in the entire city in my opinion, there\u0027s just not enough praise for it!\n\nThe garlic bread however, was very disappointing.. it was just soooooooo small! the taste was fine, but the size was making me cry! There\u0027s nothing to say about the drink obviously, it was just an average coke. (tbh I prefer Pepsi though)\n\nAll in all, Garlic bread was a 3/10, while the pizza, oh god, it was an 11! Overall experience? the great pizza completely disregard the awful garlic bread, so it\u0027s a 10! \n\nPs. pic of miniature garlic bread attached","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-11-03T21:46:27+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-04T17:47:34+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"645001568884330","from":{"name":"Shahbaz Lalani","id":"100000311538556"},"message":"And not a single like was given that day.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T17:39:17+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645001798884307","from":{"name":"Umer Zaib Khan","id":"1649620209"},"message":"why don\u0027t you have a glass of","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T17:40:16+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645002012217619","from":{"name":"Shahbaz Lalani","id":"100000311538556"},"message":"Please refrain from using abusive language.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T17:41:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645002435550910","from":{"name":"Umer Zaib Khan","id":"1649620209"},"message":"Have a pg glass of","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T17:42:23+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645004428884044","from":{"name":"Rabeet Rao","id":"749204552"},"message":"^ LOL!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T17:47:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ1MDA0NDI4ODg0MDQ0","before":"NjQ1MDAxNTY4ODg0MzMw"}}},"picture":"http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/1385973_10200440939379922_2016658864_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10200440939379922\u0026set\u003dgm.644606168923870\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_644633895587764","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Bots Leather Jacket Fillet, Pungush Karachi and Fish Hot n Sour White:-","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-11-03T22:56:50+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-04T17:42:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz","before":"NzE3NzYwNjU4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"644851768899310","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"What no review?

It’s a sophisticated fine dining restaurant. The set-up is “bistro style” and offers nice extensive menu. Ordered Mushroom Chicken, Chicken Cheese Burger, Fettuccine Pasta. Served within 15-20 minutes. The food was amazing and done with perfection. For Ambiance, some may find it cramped, I found it cozy albeit a little dark. Decor is fresh, sparkling clean white table cloths, indoor, outdoor both. The weather was pleasant so we chose to sat outside. Loved the green plantation with the dim lights in it.

The words \"huge\", \"big\" or \"giant\" are an understatement. For Rs. 1500, one MAMMOTH size serving of Hot n Sour Soup, really beautiful Spicy Steamed Wantons (I can just have a hundred of them per day and not complain, and yes they\u0027re true to their name i.e. \u0027spicy\u0027), another MAMMOTH size serving of American Chopsuey (they go overboard with the sauce/topping for the chopsuey; poora bowl bhar gaya tha with just the sauce, lol) and yet again, a MAMMOTH size serving of Egg Fried Rice with Szechuan Chicken.\nAll in all, absolutely wonderful experience. The food was steaming hot when it arrived, which was surprising (and pleasing) since I live in Gulistan-e-Jauhar and the rider managed to deliver the food piping hot. What I really loved was the fact that they were flexible enough to change the Fried Wantons (the actual part of the deal) to Spicy Steamed Wantons. Very few places left in K-Town that go flexible with their deals for the customer, let alone do it in the same price.\n\nP.S. I know I\u0027m late since GD has been running its services for quite a time now.\n\nEat on people!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-02T21:04:30+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-04T08:36:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"818010033","name":"Anum Ahmer"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"589410175","name":"Shumaila Firdous"},{"id":"523884020","name":"Musfirah Karimi"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"100001249191882","name":"Fozia Amjad"},{"id":"100002668207268","name":"Dania Faisal Tai"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjY4MjA3MjY4","before":"ODE4MDEwMDMz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"644104222307398","from":{"name":"Fozia Amjad","id":"100001249191882"},"message":"Tu akelay five persons ki deal khanay ki Kia zarorat thi rabeet.dosroon ko bhi pooch laitay na","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-02T22:41:15+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644232428961244","from":{"name":"Maheen Siddiqui","id":"1198610816"},"message":"They delivered u 1500 ka order ?
