Being greedy we ordered a mixed grill (it was off the menu, asked the owner to give us a sampling of the best grilled meat on their menu) as well and I liked the saffron chicken though the lamb kebabs, different ones this time, in the mixed grill platter stole the show.

It was a successful event and we had a great time meeting new people :)  \n\nFirstly last night was one of the coldest nights by far and I thought we were going to turn into popsicles but thanks to the  management at Sajjad that didn\u0027t happen. It was unusually and surprisingly warm. Its covered from all sides and has fires burning at different spots which is really nice. So this answers the question for all who have been seeking a warm spot at do darya.\n\nNow to the FOOD.\nStarters: Chicken Dhakka, Hot and Sour Soup, BBQ prawns, lemon chicken and fish dhakka.\n\nMains: Afghani Boti, Chicken karhai, Shahi Handi.\n\nSTARTERS:\n• Chicken Dhakka: \n The most loved starter off all time I assume. It had been wiped clean off the dish as soon as it hit the table. Boneless chicken fried in a delicious batter served with this amazing sauce. Hands down the best dish on the menu and a must must try.\n\n•Hot \u0026 Sour Soup:\nDefiantly has room for improvement. But since we were sitting in a Pakistani themed Resturant i didn\u0027t expect a tiny Chinese man dancing out of my soup. So all good.\n\n•BBQ Prawns: \nOk i am not a seafood person at all. So according to the people who ate them they did enjoy. Its a very interesting dish. Plain simple flavours which enhanced the taste of the prawns \n\n•Lemon Chicken:\nAnother of my favorites. YUM i felt like im in chicken heaven. Crunchy chicken fried perfectly packed with that lemon zing. At the same time it didnt over power the chicken.\nI would keep going back for that.\n\n•Fish Dhaka:\nAnother one of the yummi delights. Me not being a sea food person fell for them like i slipped on a banana peel. \nMust try again. A complete winter dish\n\nMAINS:\nWe had stuffed our selfs with the starters lol\n\n•Chicken Karhai:\nJust has a taste but now i know why are they famous for it. Tasted yum.\n\n•Afghani Beef Boti:\nI can keep returning for that every single day. Soft, filled with taste, melts in the mouth. Neither to spicy neither bland just the right amount of spices.\n\n•Shahi Chicken Handi:\nA shahi handi for a shahi gathering lol. \nI love it. Boneless chicken chunks cooked in butter and topped with cheese and hints of fresh herbs. It has that yummy creamy subtle taste. Geez my mouth still waters for it. Total justice to the dish.\n\nOverall: \nGreat service.\nFood arrived hot and on time.\nAttentive staff.\nLoved the plastic covers against the wind. \n\nSpecial thankyou to all the foodies that showed up. \nHope to see u all soon.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-29T14:35:00+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-02T21:31:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"541880374","name":"Noreen Ahmed"},{"id":"100001434743152","name":"Raza Rehmani"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"100003570224157","name":"Kashif Khan"},{"id":"100001356574653","name":"Rude Plannet Kennel Rpk"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"532470690","name":"Sana Zaeem"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"887535136","name":"Jabbar Abdul"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"796000540","name":"Nisa Abdul Basit Khan"},{"id":"100001217752738","name":"MehRose Khan"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"729875068","name":"Soomro Ali"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"733018407","name":"Nabeel Kazi"},{"id":"100002943458913","name":"Aisha Wali Muhammad"},{"id":"1356485615","name":"Samrah Owais"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5MjA0NTUy","before":"MTAwMDA1NDIxODIzNTg4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_674208709296949/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNzQ5MjA0NTUy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"674210079296812","from":{"name":"Zohaib Ali Memon","id":"524501080"},"message":"need to make it to one of these some day","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:38:13+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213699296450","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"So who all came?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:10+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213745963112","from":{"name":"Khozema Soni","id":"513558813"},"message":"If this event took place why was that girl siting alone ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:18+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674216695962817","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Khozema Soni well there was a bit of miscommunication.

Food Panda called me up a few minutes later to tell me that they couldn\u0027t place the order since it was only available from 7-11 pm. It really annoyed me coz they insisted that the \"7-11 pm\" clause was  on the website even though I saw no such thing. I checked the site again and did not see any 7-11 pm clause. There was one for dinner and lunch deals but nothing for the \"Crazy Offer\". Despite calling them and lodging a complaint, they weren\u0027t that concerned.
