We ordered Mexican steak and peppercorn steak. The steaks were cooked to perfection. The service was quick too. The portions were very generous. We ordered their apple pie. It was delicious except rather being on a bit more sweetened side for me. The ambiance was great. The only thing that totally ruined my appetite was seeing a mosquito fly and buzz over my food.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-05T13:17:50+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-05T13:17:50+0000"},{"id":"165861103465048_553445008039987","from":{"name":"Umer Mukhtar","id":"501643002"},"message":"pane and amore love hai yaar","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-05T12:35:22+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-05T12:35:22+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001432075867","name":"Suhaila Tobeh"},{"id":"514290400","name":"Hirah Sid"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA1OTkwMTU1","before":"MTAwMDAxNDMyMDc1ODY3"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_553353908049097","from":{"name":"Sabeika Raza","id":"709207066"},"message":"Who is open  for lunch","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-05T08:20:44+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-05T12:05:45+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"553358384715316","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"we are","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-05T08:39:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"553362701381551","from":{"name":"Sabeika Raza","id":"709207066"},"message":"Aww.

The rest of the dishes namely Spicy Thai Fried Noodles, Thai Beef in Oyster Sauce and Chicken with Cashew Nuts were as enjoyable as always.  The Chocolate and Vanilla Gelato also from Mao\u0027s menu are comparable to the best gelato\u0027s available in the town.  A perfect 10/10.  For all you Thai food lovers out there, do give \"Mao Red Curry\" a try, it\u0027s amazing.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-04T21:35:06+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-05T07:34:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"739231013","name":"Aiya Quli"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"1463201564","name":"ArtScene Galleries"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQ2MzIwMTU2NA\u003d\u003d","before":"MTA0MTAyNDE0Mw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"553207634730391","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"That mao red curry is awesome...world class stuff...had a sampler at omar\u0027s last week...and the gelato is awesome...always...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-04T21:54:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"553342368050251","from":{"name":"Uzma Arij Bilgrami","id":"504398246"},"message":"I second that.
