I was really excited and oh well, i only WAS excited. Went with 2 friends, the place was pretty crowded and we were seated right away at the 1st floor (ambiance: 6/10).Turn off#1. I expected some complimentary bread basket etc but nothing. Found an exciting menu and that further ignited my appetite. Order 3 main courses and 2 drinks. Turn off #2. the waiter insisted to order their special beverages though we kindly refused about 4 times, eventually a shut up call was given. The food arrived within 30mins.\nTurn off#3. The chicken waffles were all about vegetables! Bland sauce, dry chicken, ordinary tarragons have more taste than this (5/10)\nTurn off#4. Burrito bowl, it looked like an absolute delight and all 3 of us attacked but Alas! it was a \u0027Chana Chaat Pulao\u0027 under the lettuce (it was hollow from the bottom). Its was beyond awful! Truly inedible, all the food was neither warm or cold, that was weird!\nTurn off#5. Mushroom Mac \u0026 Cheese, another bland dish, the cheese was all stiff from the top, stiff and kinda burnt pepperoni tiny bits, so the serving sizes were really disappointing.\nTurn off#6. The bill amounted to about 3k, since the experience was awful, with dissatisfied tummies,  it was pricey for me to pay 1k per head.\n\nNo offense but it was not my kind of a place. I\u0027d still like to congratulate team pantry for putting in an effort, maybe I had a bad day since so many customers wouldn\u0027t have been there if it was that bad.
