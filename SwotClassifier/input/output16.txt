It is highly over-rated.. And the pictures on their menu board are most deceiving. \n\n- We asked for a mixed berry parfait and the only thing it had was granola and oats, the berries were in the form of a sugar fruit syrup with the seeds unlike how it shows on the menu board with the strawberry slices, raspberries and stuff. \n\n- Secondly, the waffles were dry like eating plastic. Pre-packed and heated in the microwave. And who serves Cream Cheese with chocolate waffles? I mean it was so dry we had to put the frozen yogurt from the parfait on the waffle and eat it to give it some taste! \n\n- Lastly, with reference to the image of the smoothie below, we got something which we were wondering is it even ours? Like.. Why do u put up pics of such tempting looking smoothies and serve it up like an epic fail substance. Thank God we didn\u0027t order the panini cuz it just looked sad and depressed at the counter waiting to die. \n\nSo basically, if you like Fro-yo, just have a cup of your favourite flavour and do not risk trying anything else.  Sad. Sad.

Unfortunately, we did not meet your –or our own – expectations. \n\nWe would like to go through your complaint point by point:\n\n1) We have immediately ordered for a change of pictures and renaming of our Mix Berry Parfait to \u0027Mix Berry Compote Parfait\u0027 at both our outlets.  The change should be in effect within the next two days. \n\nWe use fresh strawberries whenever they are in season, however in off-season we import high-quality French frozen berries for use in our mixed-berry parfait. Since frozen berries can be hard on the gums, we make a \u0027compote\u0027 out of the frozen berries for ease of consumption.\n\n2) It is company policy that all our waffles are prepared on order using our waffle irons. Red Mango does not pre-prepare or microwave any of its waffles. It is also company policy for each waffle to be served with a side of yogurt cream cheese and canadian maple syrup.  \n\nYour post suggests that you were not served maple syrup with your order of waffles, and we are extremely sorry for this.\n\n3) The menu picture you have posted is of a spoonable smoothie,whereas the item that you were       served is a fresh fruit smoothie. It appears that you were served an incorrect item. Again, we are extremely sorry for this miscommunication. \n\nBecause of these oversights, we would like to invite you to our either of our stores to avail each of the three above items free of charge.\n\nWe deeply value your relationship with Red Mango and are committed to providing you with the highest level of service because our customers deserve the very best. \n\nWe hope to see you at Red Mango soon, and would like to apologize once again for your sub-standard experience.\n\nYours in service,\n\nThe Red Mango Team","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-30T13:49:46+0000","like_count":10,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"504776217","name":"Rahila Najaf Nizam","type":"user","offset":0,"length":18}]},{"id":"674814592569694","from":{"name":"Ashnaa F Khan","id":"650649934"},"message":"^ Awesome customer feedback response! :like:","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-30T17:27:40+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"675075115876975","from":{"name":"Rahila Najaf Nizam","id":"504776217"},"message":"Red, thank you for your warm and re-affirming message.
