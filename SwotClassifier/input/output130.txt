Over the years I had grown quite fond of the place and would count myself as one of its regulars. I am most sorry to admit that after last nights meal I nor any of the 12 guests I was with, will ever visit there again. We were served by our usual waiter, a chap that I am very nervous around due to the fact that on a previous occasion he accidentally poured an entire glass of iced mint lemonade down my back, an incident I chose to overlook at the time and continued to dine at the restaurant. However this evening, aside from the continuous knocks I would receive on my chair by the clumsy waiter, all seemed to be going well. That was until we were served dessert and coffee accompanied ( in our utter shock) by our 14th uninvited guest, a COCKROACH!!! Not the small freshly hatched kind but the medium sized teenaged rebel that seemed just as shocked to see us. It made its way out of the sugar bowl and decided to take a brisk walk around the table. It was apprehended by one of my guests who used a plate to put it down. Although he laughed it off to ease the embarrassment that was by now clearly apparent on my face, the utter disgust at what had just happened could not be camouflaged. I should have gotten up and left immediately whilst at the same time creating a huge hue and cry to make sure every single person at the restaurant would realise what had just happened. I did not do that. Against my better judgement I chose to give the restaurant a chance. The manager gave me the usual excuses, one involved the fact that there was a tree in the middle of the restaurant, as if that insignificant piece of information was somehow supposed to make me feel better. I was even more shocked that I was presented with the bill shortly afterwards. I decided to speak to the owners of the restaurant, I refused to believe they were made aware of the situation and that I was now being treated in this manner. The manager of course would not let me speak to the owner, I was given the customary excuse that his phone was off. So I made a call, got the number and called myself. Lo and behold! I got through by the third ring. After calmly explaining the situation and receiving many apologies by the owner I was still presented with the bill! This time however it was reduced by comping us the 4 coffees we had ordered and removing the tax! ( a kacha bill so to speak!!!) I was dumbfounded to say the least! I thought I would have been better off raising a ruckus and embarrassing the restaurant which was by now receiving its next party. I again messaged the owner asking him if I was really expected to pay this bill. When he replied that I should, I had decided that was it for me. I paid the bill and left quietly. I decided to wait till today to write this, because I did not want to ramble on in anger. I think that more then the disgust and shock at what happened I am saddened that even at a restaurant like Pompeii there is no accountability. I\u0027m certain the restaurateur would have dined abroad and is quite aware of how matters such as these are dealt with, but as usual even the educated lot believe that in Pakistan, \"sub kuch chalta hai\". This \"let it all hang out\" attitude has gotten us to where we are today. We see it everywhere, everyday! It was silly of me to expect anything different here. \n\nIt is shameful. I am sure this incident will make no difference to the owners, they got paid and that\u0027s all that counts! A few apologies and a kacha bill later this will be forgotten. A fact that the owner was probably well aware of, he is well educated!  ( in the system, the lawlessness and the superficiality of this country) Hats off to him! He made his sale. Chaching!!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-18T10:28:20+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-19T11:54:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"711699788","name":"Sanaa Zubairi"},{"id":"1668177824","name":"Omer Salimullah"},{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid"},{"id":"665690478","name":"Hassan Nadeem"},{"id":"100002505633547","name":"Umme Kulsoom Khalid Ahmed"},{"id":"1433484222","name":"Misha Dyer"},{"id":"574052713","name":"Harun Aziz"},{"id":"509630499","name":"Shahzeen Shahid Siddiqui"},{"id":"100002154180249","name":"Afifa J Maniar"},{"id":"669320704","name":"Fahad Azad"},{"id":"100001464218778","name":"Narmeen Nadir Fazwani"},{"id":"1035196445","name":"Anusha Ahmed"},{"id":"100005306882506","name":"Anisa Ahmed"},{"id":"553350590","name":"Faizan Chaghtai"},{"id":"518198693","name":"Samreen Faizan"},{"id":"1346560868","name":"Hira Javed Saya"},{"id":"1491861746","name":"Hamza Arshad Faruqui"},{"id":"640698568","name":"Pervez Sadiq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQwNjk4NTY4","before":"NzExNjk5Nzg4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"636215859762901","from":{"name":"Umtus Sanna Hussain-Mirza","id":"528525436"},"message":"well u knowwww whatb they say about 13 people at the table right? downright bad luck!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-18T12:09:40+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false},{"id":"636215986429555","from":{"name":"Umtus Sanna Hussain-Mirza","id":"528525436"},"message":"but seriously...OMG how terribleee!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-18T12:09:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"636217133096107","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Agreeable that a cockroach is a nasty visitor at a dinner table my question is what put you off more?

All the people saying that only the portion of the meal where the roach emerged should have been compensated, my question to you is.... \u0027are you oblivious to the fact that the dessert and coffee was made in the same kitchen and facility as the rest of the meal was?\u0027 There is no such thing as a \u0027dessert exclusive roach\u0027! Roaches, if there are any, will roam freely all over the kitchen and find nooks, corners, crevices and the slightest hint of a crumb to crawl all over the place. A roach is symptomatic of a larger issue at hand, one that pertains to sanitation and hygiene. A higher-end dining place like Pompeii, that would\u0027ve charged around PKR25,000 to PKR30,000 for that table of thirteen is expected to adhere to the strictest standards of cleanliness and pest-control measures. For the manager to cite the presence of a tree in the middle of a restaurant or for him to deny telephonic access to the owner of the restaurant reeks of irresponsible behavior. Also, how does abolishing the sales tax make sense to anyone? If a customer is being charged, even if it is a reduced bill, how does the waiver of the sales tax become legitimate? It is actually a violation of FBR regulations! The reason why this customer is horrified is because he was already in shock with the presence of a roach on his table (where he had invited his guests and was willing to dole out his hard-earned money to treat them to a great dining experience) and the addition of a bill in that particular circumstance must have come across as ludicrously insane! Even if the party of 13 had enjoyed their earlier courses, the point is that the entire dining experience was spoiled and people were left wondering what other morsels of theirs had those roaches crawled over in the kitchen. With that kind of thought playing on one\u0027s mind, and with disgust adorning the faces of an entire party of 13, the prospect of having to pay for that sort of a dining experience is just senseless and uncalled for! That meal should have never been charged for!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-18T14:02:27+0000","like_count":11,"user_likes":false},{"id":"636265136424640","from":{"name":"Uz Abbasi Husain","id":"706671594"},"message":"I agree!!
