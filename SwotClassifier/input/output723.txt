I really, really don\u0027t like writing mean reviews, but I think one is warranted here. We ordered the Chicken Fillet Burger, the Italian Chicken Burger and the Chicken Buffalo burger, along with starters Spicy Grilled Mushrooms and Barbecue wings. The burgers were, simply put, tasteless; like my friends and I were waiting for SOME sort of taste to come in our mouths but nothing materialized. We ended up eating only half of our burgers. But this is just the beginning; the mushrooms...oh the mushrooms! Rs. 225 for 5 mushrooms rolling around in an aluminum box, dipped in a super spicy sauce that was too spicy to eat. Only FIVE mushrooms. We didn\u0027t know whether to laugh or be mad. The wings were okay. \nOverall an extremely sad and regretful experience.
