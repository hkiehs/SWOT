I ordered the seafood chowder (i know i shudnt have ), to my surprise it wasnt that bad, but here is the catch it took the soup 45 minutes to come to the table (by about 30 minutes i had cancelled the order but they still bought it). We had ordered the beef bihari boti, the chicken peshawari karahi, the mutton brown karahi and the reshmi kababs. lets break them down one by one; the mutton brown karahi had absolutely no taste and no flavour one cud not even taste the mutton in it and it was so dry that even if you keep chewing at it for 10 min it will surely retain its shape. the reshmi kababs; they werent that bad but still would probably be a 4/10. the beef behari kabab; the beef wasnt tender or cooked properly, you actually fight the boti to get a bite. the last the chicken peshawari karahi; now this was the only dish that had any flavour in it but no taste at all.\nAll the dishes lacked and taste.
