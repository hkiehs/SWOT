The best thing about Gunsmoke was even though it is located in a mall, in no way it gave one the feeling... It is an entity on its own... Overall a brilliant experience, Thank You AC :)\n\np.s: AC\u0027s burger in the french \u0027baguette like bun\u0027 was a totally different ball game :) would recommend it highly to people who want to be adventurous with their burgers :) (I Know I would next time that I am there)\n***********************************************************\nAmbareen Khan\nDear fellow swotties..I was on the table next to yours during the Gun Smoke food tasting today. Must say I agree in most part with your reviews. However there were some issues I pointed out. Firstly the cheese nachos were too \u0027processed\u0027 for my taste. They were simply spicy doritos covered in canned cheese dip and salsa. I was told that corn chips were not available locally(??) and therefore they had to stick to doritos. Secondly all of us ordered our burgers with the orginal bun which I feel does not do the juicy burger justice. Again I was told that Dawn is the only option so choice is limited. Salads, a few of them like the eggplant tomato was outstanding, wheras the pasta salad lacked oomph. However would I go again? Most certainly because I feel Gun Smoke will be ironing out minor glitches in no time and will live up to expectations set in part ,but obviously not solely,by its amazing ambience...\n***********************************************************\nAdnaan Chaudhary\nGun Smoke. Perfect wings. Grilled to perfection. The grilled prawn cocktail is divine. The burger in the french baguette bun was awesome. Head grill master personally delivered. Soup was great. Salad bar needs tweaking. Service still rough around the edges. But for day one it was miles ahead of any newbie joint. Prices equate value for money. Harris and kamran sheikh. Your Genesis is standing proud and tall. Bravissimo.\n***********************************************************\nNezihe Hussain\nWhat a day. Strike, heat, humidity all combined couldnt take away the wonderful time spent with fellow swotties....lovers of food. Many a noble bovine race sacrificed their lives for todays gastronomy of protiens.\n\nAt the SWOT Opening (soft) for GUNSMOKES latest venture at Dolmen Mall Clifton, met up to sample their menu and service.\n\nThe place has a fun feel. Perfectly chilled in this weather it was a pleasure to walk into the vibrant alive place.\n\nGun Smoke is synonymous with \"hutke\" \"something different\" and they have lived up to their promise.\n\nThe food thu limitedmin option today since it was a soft opening was really good. The burgers amazing. But i resent the favoritism being shown to lumboo when he got the french baguette bun and i got the regular soft bun.\n\nThe wings thu grilled and not crispy (as i like it) were cooked to perfection and yum. The nachos on the other had were doritos (not nice) the grilled prawns on a stick were perfection and i think even the BOTS spy got some tips.\n\nA place to head to on a hot Karachi summer or just for a bite of something yum. Guns are surely Smoking this time.\n\nWell done Kamran Sheikh and team.\n\nThank you Adnaan Chaudhary for arranging the lunch.\n***********************************************************\nShaikh Fawad\nGuess u guys heard Huh??? Yeah we went to Gun Smoke\u0027s- DollmenCity soft VIP opening courtesy AC. Felt a bit superstarish walking in as a line of envious eyes watched in jealousy… or may be in just hunger, as it was Lunch time, and the smell of a burger grill may have been more of a reason for wide\u0026wild-open-eyes than the long list of SWOT celebrities : P.... anyWho, here are the dirty details:\nMuniza and I started w/ the soup and salad. Thought the flavors of the fresh\u0026gr8 ingredients would have been enhanced if more seasoning was applied, but a dash of salt did the trick there:)\nNachos: I really didn’t think that classic Doritos could make such gr8 Nacho’s…talk about authentic : P … wings were gr8 \u0026 perfectly succulent but I prefer both crispy on the outside \u0026 succulent on the LogINN,) side.\nBurger: I had the Mushroom Cheese, which was awesome!!! I could tell the cooking- time was something they take into consideration, as I had a perfectly cooked patty that was soft to bite in to : ))))))))))))))))) Muniza had the Pesto Burger \u0026 from what she told me it was also excellent :)\nI personally like thick home fries, but the perfectly crispy, skinny ones offered were piping hot, and only needed a dash of salt too make it deliciously savory.\nI thought the falsay drink was fantastic, so was the mint drink, but the former won my heart, as it wasn’t too sugary yet tasted natural and very refreshing!!!\nAll’n all, a gr8 opening!!! congrats Harris, and Kamran on yet another franchise : )\n***********************************************************\nHussain Tariq\nWent on the soft opening of Gun and Smoke on the invitation of Adnaan Chaudhary - Found the place extremely welcoming and lively!! of course had the company of amazing swotties Nezihe Hussain, Shaikh Fawad his lovely wife, Ally Aadil Bhamani Ryeaan Anwar Chaudhary Luciferz Angel and many many more... since it was a soft launch so few hiccups were expected but service was perfectly fine!! Tried a spoon full of doritos in Jalapeno dip (guess they were not served as Nachos) the dip / dressing was spicy and nice..wings were nice crispy and had amazing spicy tinge to them...and for the main course had a Jalapeno burger - the meat was perfectly char grilled and burger was good though bit crumby from the top but like always I remove the soggy part the one that has extra cheese and sauce and have my patty with the top part because it is always crispier so ended up enjoying my burger a lot! The mint lemonade was little over sweet but perfect, perhaps that is how it should be if not specified otherwise! My son would be a regular there because he is a huge burger fan!! The best part about the place is its location though its part of the mall and yet its away from the madding crowd..so one does not feel that he is sitting in a mall with crowd staring at you from everywhere!! All in all a very good experience!!\n***********************************************************","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T16:27:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-14T10:19:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"711705428","name":"Basit Nasir Ahmed"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"643423090","name":"Junaid Zuberi"},{"id":"592813967","name":"Umme Hamdani"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcwMTAwMTk4","before":"MTAwMDAyOTY3NTA0MTU5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397349016982921","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Luciferz Angel Ambareen Khan Nezihe Hussain Adnaan Chaudhary Hussain Tariq Shaikh Fawad Najam Quddusi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T16:31:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14},{"id":"676177213","name":"Ambareen Khan","type":"user","offset":15,"length":13},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain","type":"user","offset":29,"length":14},{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","type":"user","offset":44,"length":16},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq","type":"user","offset":61,"length":13},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi","type":"user","offset":88,"length":13}]},{"id":"397349063649583","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"thanks","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T16:31:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"397352813649208","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Raheel.

Isn\u0027t it normal to expect satisfaction for one\u0027s money spent? Ignore my wants and I will no longer appear in your restaurant. Satisfy those wants and I will become increasingly loyal. Add a little extra personal attention and a friendly touch and I will become a walking advertisement for you. \n\nWhen I criticize your food and service to anyone who will listen, which I may do whenever I am displeased, take heed. I am not dreaming up displeasure. It lies in something I perceive you have failed to do to make my eating experience as enjoyable as I have anticipated. Eliminate that perception or you will lose my friends and me as well. I insist on the right to dine leisurely or eat in haste according to my mood. \n\nI refuse to be rushed as I abhor waiting. This is an important privilege that my money buys. If I am not spending big money this particular time, just remember, if you treat me right I will return with a larger appetite, more money and probably with my friends. \n\nI am much more sophisticated these days than I was just a few years ago. I\u0027ve grown accustomed to better things and my needs are more complex. I\u0027m perfectly willing to spend, but I insist on quality to match prices. I am above all, a human being. I am especially sensitive when I am spending money. I can\u0027t stand to be snubbed, ignored or looked down upon. \n\nWhatever my personal habits may be, you can be sure that I\u0027m a real nut on cleanliness in restaurants. Where food is concerned I demand the strictest sanitation measures. I want my meals handled and served by the neatest of people and in sparkling clean dishes. If I see dirty fingernails, cracked dishes or soiled table clothes you won\u0027t see me again. \n\nYou must prove to me again and again that I have made a wise choice in selecting your restaurant above others. You must convince me repeatedly that being a restaurant guest is a desirable thing in the first place. I can, after all, eat at home. So, you must provide something extra in food and service. Something so superior it will beckon me from my own table to yours. \n \n\nDo we understand each other? \n\n- author unknown","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T09:48:17+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-14T09:59:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"570766058","name":"Ayesha Saeed"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"631505154","name":"Zainab Dar"},{"id":"501447368","name":"Lubna Ashraf Jafri"},{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid"},{"id":"573859815","name":"Nighat Khan"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"579820606","name":"Smita Byramji Mama"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"1360134242","name":"Fahima Mubashir"},{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"507428445","name":"Yasir Khan"},{"id":"502393296","name":"Raheel Masood"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"60505961","name":"Sarah Ovais"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"641326124","name":"Saad Habib"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"770525337","name":"Afshan Yawer"},{"id":"624456301","name":"Amna Magsi"},{"id":"515193342","name":"Mesam Akhter"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE1MTkzMzQy","before":"MTAwMDAzNjgxNDkzODIy"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_397201866997636/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNTE1MTkzMzQy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397227743661715","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"This was a perfect summation for every owner to read.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T11:15:01+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"397227916995031","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"Cheers Adnaan Chaudhary :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T11:15:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","type":"user","offset":7,"length":16}]},{"id":"397243320326824","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"This is a code that all should follow.

The Spicy Nachos were excellent !! \n\nMain Course:\n\nMexican Spicy Fish, Spicy Beef Steak, Mexican Chicken Steak, Mexican Beef Steak and Mushroom Chicken (I guess, not sure)\n\nThe fish and steaks were perfect ! Simple, good presentation, nothing too fancy or pretentious.
