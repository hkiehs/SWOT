called Cafeela and they kindly agreed to tailor make the food the way I wanted it.Just to play safe my order was predominated by BBq.They took about an hour but it was worth the wait, everthing arrived tightly packed in plastic wrap in addition to tin foil.Bhindi in Olive Oil was good, their BBq was perfect even better than bbq tonite as it was bbqued to perfection and not over bbqued.Rashmi kebab,paneer tikka,malai boti,boneless chicken karahi white were splendid,well flavored but not over spiced or charred and with the proper packing the bbq was warm,soft and moist, every tin foil had a lemon piece to drizzle the meat with.I think Cafeela delivers on quality and service and yet manages to keep their prices competitive.Well done team Cafeela.I am a happy camper.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-18T20:20:44+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-18T20:20:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100006717730226","name":"Cafeela
