It has made in a small cottage like place creating a homely atmosphere. Courtyard has been dedicated to hookah smokers so they can enjoy in the open air and also save non-sheesha people from suffocation. The words used in the menu card are interesting like ‘besharam – topless burger’. Tried their chocolate shake, illachi chai, and Patti thok k, cheeni rok k Chai, and all were awesome :p the interior, specially the washroom, the staircase, all has been designed based on truck art. One can notice the JUTT standards all around as the brand language used by them is so powerful :p\n\nThe service was slow but later I found out, it is still going through a soft launch.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-13T10:30:51+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-13T19:05:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"654357624","name":"Madiha Yasir"},{"id":"703935487","name":"Xoya Ahmed"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"584642194","name":"Fatima Shafiq"},{"id":"720980029","name":"Anum Haider"},{"id":"613589687","name":"Asim Pervez"},{"id":"719856022","name":"Sumera Nizamuddin"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"524565612","name":"Ali Akhtar"},{"id":"100003533323814","name":"Sarah Muhammad"},{"id":"512553759","name":"Subal Ashar"},{"id":"813090650","name":"Rehan Ahmed"},{"id":"829355187","name":"Sadaf Sarwar"},{"id":"762650482","name":"Sana Zahid"},{"id":"567315448","name":"Abid Sahi"},{"id":"535711302","name":"Taha Ali"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1241494164","name":"Dania Obaid-Naseem"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"100002850760185","name":"Nayab Ali"},{"id":"750786806","name":"Faixa Shah"},{"id":"739935375","name":"Umer Latif"},{"id":"1013437557","name":"Farhan Hafeez"},{"id":"755325547","name":"Aswad Javeri"},{"id":"539875314","name":"Zara Shaheen"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTM5ODc1MzE0","before":"NjU0MzU3NjI0"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_618130568238097/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNTM5ODc1MzE0"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"618133324904488","from":{"name":"Mohammad Saad Siddiqui","id":"589055416"},"message":"OK , now I wana ask, where it is located ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-13T10:44:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"618134128237741","from":{"name":"Syeda Rizvi","id":"647407601"},"message":"it is in clifton block 4 ..on the road alongside abdullah shah ghazi ..that links ghazi mazar to dolmen mall clifton...banglow is second on the left while going from ghazi mazar","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-13T10:48:17+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"618134214904399","from":{"name":"Syeda Rizvi","id":"647407601"},"message":"they dont have any board saying their name but a huge mostache on their building","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-13T10:48:45+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"618136124904208","from":{"name":"Abbas Lacewala","id":"1484122906"},"message":"wheres the location","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-13T10:59:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"618136201570867","from":{"name":"Uz Abbasi Husain","id":"706671594"},"message":"How innovative!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-13T10:59:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"618136524904168","from":{"name":"Naila Imran","id":"556786070"},"message":"Food is below average ,one needs look beyond ambiance and decor","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-13T11:00:56+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"618165828234571","from":{"name":"Hanna Khan","id":"540268504"},"message":"I love the fact that u mentioned abt their washrooms ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-13T12:28:31+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"618184434899377","from":{"name":"Hur Hussain Syed","id":"885610602"},"message":"LOL @ topless burger","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-13T13:19:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"618196331564854","from":{"name":"Siddik Khan","id":"531656289"},"message":"Ok, i am going now :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-13T13:50:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"618199714897849","from":{"name":"Taha Ali","id":"535711302"},"message":"Tomorrow is my day to visit!! :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-13T13:58:54+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"618202534897567","from":{"name":"Abid Sahi","id":"567315448"},"message":"service is terribly slow !! like painfully slow !! its like order and forget !! bt a nice addition to our hometowns eating out scene :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-13T14:04:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"618295124888308","from":{"name":"Muhammad Waleed Faridi","id":"511212122"},"message":"Starbucks turned into Sattar Buksh lol wow.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-13T17:28:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"618325798218574","from":{"name":"Mahreen Kamran","id":"576475435"},"message":"Me \u0026 my friend had bad experience though...

The server was very informative and helpful and quickly customised the dishes a little as I like, we ordered Sev Puri as a starter and Chicken with tarragon sauce and Mushrooms and a beef steak with olive oil, garlic , lemon and rocket leaves. It was delicious and perfectly cooked, chicken was moist and tender and the beef has pretty pink centre just as I like. Superb. The complimentary bread and herb butter was classic and thoroughly enjoyed by all especially my two year old son who hardly likes eating out.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-13T18:18:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-13T18:18:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"1600141792","name":"Yasir Hanif"},{"id":"646760193","name":"Rehma Tirmizey"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"504122416","name":"Muhammad Saad Bin Jaleel"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"1500529009","name":"Zaki Omerson"},{"id":"658405020","name":"Omair Omerson"},{"id":"706770021","name":"Fariha Tungekar"},{"id":"718040607","name":"Rizwan Ali Nayani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE4MDQwNjA3","before":"MTAwMDAyNjUzODU0MjIx"}}},"picture":"http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/1229872_10152640311180021_700079282_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10152640311180021\u0026set\u003dpcb.618310404886780\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d4","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_618149321569555","from":{"name":"Bushra Joyo","id":"1421223164"},"message":"- at office today on my recommendation we ordered Golden Dragon Chinese Cuisine\u0027s lunch deal for four.\n\nThe only plus point was the quantity of food.\n\nThe rider forgot to bring soup while delivering our order so he had to go all the way back.
