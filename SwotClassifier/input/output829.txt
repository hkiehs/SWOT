I\u0027m a usual with Capt Saleem or Capt Arif, but last night decided to go with Capt Bilal on the recommendation of Ahmed Shahnawaz(who again isn\u0027t a member of this group?) Everything was superrb, this guy took us for a good 2 hour ride before camping out in the sea for food. The others just take you around for a bit and then start the cooking, but he made sure we enjoyed the ride. The food was as good as anyone else\u0027s Shrimp ka salan, aloo cutlets, fried fish, lollipop crabs, and also the mud crabs were all amazingly done. And the price he charged was also very reasonable. Dude took 10k for 20 people, while the others easily would have asked for 15-17k. I\u0027m not going on anyone else\u0027s boat, ever again.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-04-06T04:34:28+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-12T09:35:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"593086875","name":"Pervin Minwalla"},{"id":"1268142470","name":"Monty Mashooqullah"},{"id":"780381887","name":"Samar Husain"},{"id":"889085130","name":"Filza Hai"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"100003048636530","name":"Sami Baba"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"1573397773","name":"Yaasmeen Abedeen"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"100000759794024","name":"Ahmed Shahnawaz"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk0MjM4NzQy","before":"MTQyMTIyMzE2NA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"351779204873236","from":{"name":"Sadaf Munir","id":"100002605916001"},"message":"Hain???
