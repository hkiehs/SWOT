The flame grilled chicken royale burger was exactly how a burger should be. Enjoyed every bite. 10/10. Bonus points for being sooooooo good on the pocket!!!! Every single positive review was not exaggerated, it was yummy. And fries were great too. The owners are veryyyy sweet and accomodating. They are introducing delivery soon as well. The broast was nothing great...actually find everything except Karachi Broast quite bland but this is the only place that gives you a full bun ? The place has no waiters or ac but we still left with happy tummies and happy wallets! I guess thats all that matters in the end, after all. Thanks Qamarunnisa and Luciferz Angel for the high recommendation!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-08T00:18:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-09T11:08:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001785621656","name":"Ansari Zufah"},{"id":"100000117456713","name":"Junaid Bangriwala"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"672626621","name":"Asad Baig"},{"id":"100003882511403","name":"Ameer Hamza"},{"id":"502280426","name":"Husnain Zahid"},{"id":"1533009868","name":"Sehr Atif"},{"id":"515216311","name":"Ammar Ather"},{"id":"667511058","name":"Mohsin Makki"},{"id":"100000986469861","name":"Rabiya Jawed"},{"id":"766934674","name":"Mohammad Asim"},{"id":"1579891410","name":"Erum Siddiqui"},{"id":"614605531","name":"Asad Saeed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE0NjA1NTMx","before":"MTAwMDAxNzg1NjIxNjU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"581981285186359","from":{"name":"Sheikh Arsalan Saeed","id":"548806223"},"message":"location please?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-08T00:20:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"581981611852993","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"The garlic mayo deserves a special mention! ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-08T00:22:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"581981755186312","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"I think it was bahadurabad,....opp zameer ansari..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-08T00:23:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"582018688515952","from":{"name":"Haris Hassan","id":"673567501"},"message":"I went there last week and its a good sasti and tikaoo place. The problem is that they have so many varieties of burgers that one kind of gets lost! Even the molvi sb at the reception was confused when I asked him to help me out with the burger details. I tried the zinger with jalepeno and it was good. My friend tried chicken steak burger and he was also happy. During the day without A/C its a little difficult to settle but overall the food is fine and the service is also satisfactory. More of a boys hangout place rather than families but overall economical and good to visit if you are on a very very very tight budget :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-08T02:48:24+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"582031891847965","from":{"name":"Daniyal Qazi","id":"509315108"},"message":"How much do the burgers cost?
