For the past 2 years I am residing in Karachi and my hunt for best Nihari is still not over. I have tried Zahid Nihari, Javed Nihari, Nihari Inn, Delhi Muslim, Delhi Sohail, Waheed and Ghaffar in Bahadurabad. So far I have not found the original \"Bong\" in Karachi but as far as Nihari is concerned, Delhi Ghaffar beats every Nihari restaurant in Karachi (I know most of the people wont agree with me on this). But if I talk about my overall Nihari experience, Waris Nihari in Lahore is simply unbeatable. I still have to try Sabri Nihari in Saddar and I have high hopes from it. Please suggest places where I can find the best Nihari or are there any restaurants who serve \"Bong\"?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-21T21:05:35+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-23T02:13:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501737785","name":"Aamir Dhedhi"},{"id":"723835542","name":"Fariha Aamir Khan"},{"id":"100001822097920","name":"Sara Kazmi"},{"id":"1049298397","name":"Sadiya Naveed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA0OTI5ODM5Nw\u003d\u003d","before":"NTAxNzM3Nzg1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"589845391066615","from":{"name":"Nadia Nadeem","id":"100000087144502"},"message":"Sabri saddar is the best","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T21:08:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589846077733213","from":{"name":"Syed Wamiq Haider","id":"514714415"},"message":"Its Sabri Nihari, tell me when are we going..

Except for the Manchurian Of which the chicken was a bit hard all was great. From beef section we took beef chilli which was absolutely delicious and Sichuan fish which I even though not a Sea food lover, loved. Oh and not to forget the hot n sour soup which was also great. The only down side was that they didn\u0027t have a proper prayer area for women, they did have the space though, should\u0027ve just made it more appropriate for prayers.
