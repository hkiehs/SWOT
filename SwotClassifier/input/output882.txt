I was talking to my mom today, she said she wanted to have chinese, so i decided to order today.\nWe ordered the deal for 4 people, in which I got special hot \u0026 sour soup, fried chicekn wontons, chicken with almonds \u0026 vegetables, american chopsuey,  and egg friend rice.\ni placed my order at around 9:52 and the person who took my order told me that the order will take around 60-75 min to deliver. and at exactly 10:30 my door bell rang and the order had arrived in exactly 38 min! \ni was extremely hungry as i had missed lunch today and the before time arrival of piping hot food just made my day.\nbut little did i know that the speedy delivery was just the start to a wonderful experience. the food was divine!! when they delivery guy handed me over the big plastic bag i was suprised that it was so huge. took inside, mom took the food out in serving bowls and i was just looking at the quantity of food and wondering if i got the correct order :P\n\ni\u0027m not much of a soup person but i had a few spoonfuls of the special hot \u0026 sour soup. and then i took some more. and then some more. and then some more! i couldnt have enough of the soup it was so delicious! full of tiny pieces of chicken and carrots and the taste was divine. i stopped myself because i had to eat other things too. \nthe wontons were crispy and yummy. \nthe egg fried rice we light and delicious and can be eaten without any gravy, they were so good. the chicken with almonds \u0026 vegetable tasted really nice with the rice.\n\nbut the star of the night was the american chopsuey! ufff it was the best i had ever had! the crunchy crispy noodles, the fired egg on top and the gravy! haye haye haye! what taste! it has large pieces of chicken and large prawns in it, the vegetables we fresh and the gravy was so delicious i literally licked off my plate. slightly sweet, slightly sour, i fought with my brother over who would finish it :P\n\nand for such an awesome price! i got all of this for only Rs.1250! talk about value for money! infact, incredible value for money!\n\nGolden Dragon has won my heart tonight. Qamarunnisa Asim, you are running a fabulous place, keep up the good work and you will soon take over the entire chinese food market in town! my mom sends her blessings and duas your way :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-29T20:11:56+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-30T19:44:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"1039048992","name":"Camilla Asmatullah"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1454993708","name":"Tehniyat K.

No need for details here, but the taste was definitely not upto the mark. so much so that we actually called the manager and asked him if the head chef has been replaced or something else which is going wrong today!\nTo make matters worse, the mocktails we ordered were tasteless, and had to be returned for betterment. Of the lot, Pina Colada never came back!\nI would have probably ignored the piece of hair i got in the salad had ONE MORE not been found in another dish. Now this is definitely not on!\nThe good thing was that when we brought all this to the notice of the manager, he was concerned and offered us complimentary dessert. Decent of him.\nAm i going back.

It caters to my Chinese, Seafood, Bbq fixes all under ONE roof, What more can one ask for? \n2) GHAFFAR KABAB HOUSE: One place a food lover can never leave dissapointed. \n3) HARDEES: If I could eat one thing all day everyday. It would be a GREAT beef n cheese burger. And for me the Hardees Superstar is the best Beef Cheese karachi has to offer. As good as it is, the other burgers are equally as bad. \n4) XANDERS: Fried Calamari, Clasic Beef Cheese Burger \u0026 New York Cheese Cake \u0027nuff said. \n5) JAVED NIHARI: Regular Swotties know me for being a desi food fanatic. And it doesn\u0027t get any desier than Javed Nihari. Best Nihari in Karachi.  \n6) AGHA SAJJI HOUSE : This is just for my katakat fix. Beats all katakat places I\u0027ve ever had. And I\u0027ve had katakat at more than a dozen places atleast. \n7) DONISL : My second favorite Kakakat joint, used to be my first. Quality has gone down. \n8) CAFE BLUE GINGER: Beef In Oyster Sauce. FTW!!\n9) MADNI BIRYANI: My favorite biryani. Sometimes consistency issues, but still the best biryani which has top quality chawal unlike others. \n10) KUNDAN BROAST: With a different broast waala on every street corner, standing out takes hard work. And stand out, Kundan does. \n\nNotable Mentions : \nTUC : RVC\nCakery: Cheesecakes, Cheesecakes and Cheesecakes\nChips: Beef Cheese. \nKarachi Broast: Love their Dry shashlik with the special hot sauce.\nBADAL PAN SHOP: For a must Raja Sahab after dining out experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-30T05:43:03+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-30T10:59:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"581895987","name":"Emane Haque"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"531710313","name":"Aly Raza"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE5MjM1ODcz","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"388889521162204","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"Badal Pan Shop? the one on five star chowrangi? behind babulilm?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-30T06:41:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"388891964495293","from":{"name":"Danial Rizvi","id":"726690443"},"message":"Yeah","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-30T06:46:46+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"388921331159023","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"sdcr: ghaffar is my all time favour and so is agha sajji house.
