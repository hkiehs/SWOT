Ordered online through KhaoPiyopk.com at 5:15 yesterday. Till 6:22 there was no confirmation call or any updates on my order so called them after trying for almost half an hour as couldn\u0027t get through their nos. I was assured that the order was received and is in process. I requested them to deliver before iftar and they did assure me. Even after calling and making sure that the order reaches before Iftar, there was no sign of the pizza till 8:00 pm. All this time had not had any iftar as was relying on them. Finally i decided to check my order online and to my horror, there was a post at 6:45 apologizing that they only deliver to Clifton and Defence.  I mean when they reconfirmed the order, wasnt it clear to them where i was ordering from? Also they should have had the decency of atleast calling and informing so we could make other last minute arrangements. It shows the kind of service they are offering and im sure their pizza quality also reflects their careless attitude. Never in my life am I ordering anything through khao piyo or from stone baked pizza. ;(","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-16T21:25:23+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-16T21:37:41+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"424905180893971","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"there is nothing in this post - that i would contradict - the customer here has stated a very clear problem and that is miscommunication\n\nthe fact that she was ordering from an area out of delivery zone should have POPPED up ASAP she placed her order, not 1 and 1/2 hour later\n\nboth the services here are to blame and should compensate this customer - and not by promising her a free meal - but a civilized and accepting apology","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-16T21:32:32+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"424906337560522","from":{"name":"Omair Ahmed","id":"509507958"},"message":"Well said Nezihe Hussain","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-16T21:37:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDI0OTA2MzM3NTYwNTIy","before":"NDI0OTA1MTgwODkzOTcx"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_424899150894574","from":{"name":"Asher Jamal","id":"100000712081066"},"message":"Mc Flurry after like ages !!!\n\n\u003c3\n\n*awesomess*","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-16T21:12:19+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-16T21:12:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"717445135","name":"Rukaiya Karim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"680185313","name":"Khalid Ishaq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjgwMTg1MzEz","before":"NzE3NDQ1MTM1"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_424885937562562","from":{"name":"Sana Zafar","id":"1030042791"},"message":"Mcdonalds pakistan is on fb now.... \nhttps://www.facebook.com/McDonaldsPAK","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-16T20:23:49+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-16T20:47:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"680185313","name":"Khalid Ishaq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjgwMTg1MzEz","before":"NjgwMTg1MzEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"424892934228529","from":{"name":"Danial Rizvi","id":"726690443"},"message":"ki fark penda ay. not like they will give two hoots about what the customers have to say","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-16T20:47:24+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDI0ODkyOTM0MjI4NTI5","before":"NDI0ODkyOTM0MjI4NTI5"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_424064484311374","from":{"name":"Danish Munir","id":"603103229"},"message":"Planning a friends GT BRUNCH for 20/22 adults and 20/25 kids for the second day of eid !!

Situated up above Pearl Continental Hotel, the place was no less than magnificent when we walked in. The subtle ambiance, the pre-50\u0027s music playing, the extra-courteous waiters, I had a feeling it was going to be one amazing dinner. I had ordered the Chicken Dijon Steak and my friend ordered the Lobster Tail. After approximately twenty minutes of waiting, we had our food served to us. I can describe the food in one work, HORRIBLE! When a place is charging more than RS. 1000 per steak, one would obviously expect it to be amazing, but it was the worst steak I\u0027ve had in the city. And don\u0027t get me wrong, I wouldn\u0027t mind paying extra money if the food is worth it, sadly this wasn\u0027t even close. I would go as far as saying Arizona Grill serves better steaks than this place. It\u0027s terribly overpriced for the horrible food they serve. The portions were extra-small, and the steak tasted like something that would be made at home. I rank this high-class restaurant, not classy enough to go to. Extremely disappointed.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-16T05:35:17+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-16T16:24:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"1531865247","name":"Haris Ahsen"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"694723124","name":"Haris Shaikh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk0NzIzMTI0","before":"NTA1NTgxNTI4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"424680034249819","from":{"name":"De Joe","id":"597535350"},"message":"my question to u would b..... y go there in the first place. u want a good steak....... pompeii is a no brainer.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-16T05:38:21+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"424680237583132","from":{"name":"Ali Khan","id":"571016150"},"message":"Wanted to try something new, I love Pompeii but I go there too often.
