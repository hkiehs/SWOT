Little did I know that when I was told \"20 minutes\" till I get my order, that actually meant almost 45 minutes.\n\nAfter placing my order (in a hurry because the gentleman at the counter kept rushing me and complaining that he would miss his prayers because of me) I returned to the car and noticed that he had punched in a different burger on my receipt. When I returned to the counter (immediately), the person insisted that he had already confirmed the order and could not make any changes.\n\n20 minutes later, when I returned to collect my food, the cashier decided that he would be nice enough and correct my order the way I had initially intended for it to be. What he forgot to tell me was that this would take ANOTHER 20 minutes.\n\nWhile I waited for the remaining time, I met other disgruntled customers who\u0027s orders had either been messed up or simply left incomplete (the same day and also in the past). The few who hadn\u0027t experienced such troubles, were just annoyed by the ridiculously long wait time and attitude of the staff.\n\nI finally got my order and headed back home to eat it (45minutes after I had first greeted the cashier).\n\nThe much talked about \u0027juicy\u0027 burgers were so dry, that I had to pour in some of their dip/sauce to make it better. (They tasted great, but were extremely dry\nTuba Arshad, who had previously dined at The Burger Shack when it had just opened, also agreed that the burger was very dry and didn\u0027t taste as it had the previous time.\nThe peanut butter shake tasted REALLY good, but was a bit too thin in consistency for my liking.\n\nHere are a few things for the managers to keep in mind:\n\nIf you have a namaaz break policy, then it would be best to shut the counter and stop taking any orders during the specified time. I don\u0027t like being rushed into ordering my meal (as were the customers before and after me), getting it wrong, and then being blamed for your staff missing their prayers. If I want the burger bad enough, I will respect your policy and place my order after your prayers.\n\nDouble, triple check the order BEFORE the customer leaves the counter. (It has clearly been proven that you repeatedly keep getting this part wrong)\n\nThe customer is always right.\n\nOrders should be processed in the same order as they were placed. I don\u0027t like it when the guy after me (or the person after him) gets his food before I do.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-08T05:37:40+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-08T17:30:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"505341447","name":"Quratulain Syeda"},{"id":"549621042","name":"Marium Soomro"},{"id":"726361084","name":"Rabia Hassan"},{"id":"553586655","name":"Ambreen Intizar"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"591827743","name":"Tuba Arshad"},{"id":"7958572","name":"Faizan Kazi"},{"id":"502297291","name":"Zainab Abidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAyMjk3Mjkx","before":"NTA1MzQxNDQ3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"515737108477444","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"For the last point.

(Valet Parking - thank God) No reservations, but we were ushered to our seats in a matter of moments, lovely view. Opted for the Desi stuff. Ordered Peshawari Karahi, Malai Boti, Beef Seekh Kebab, Mutton Masla Chops and some boti\u0027s (forgot the name....Maybe Hunza boti\u0027s ?)..... Food prepared and arrived within 15 minutes accompanied with Puri Paratha, Kolachi Naan and Roghni Naan. Everything was delicious, my favourite were the Mutton Masala Chops and the Karahi. Floor Manager presented himself to us half way through and asked us if everything was to our liking esp food temp, quality and taste, and was very genuine in his offer to change anything which we thought was not to our satisfaction. We thanked him sincerely and continued cleaning up our plates. Machars were also enjoying the view and the weather, but were promptly put to rest after we asked for mosquito coils. Overall, the best meal thus far in the past 10 days. a SOLID overall 9/10. Total cost, Rs 2900/- for 3 pax, and we had a few left overs. Excellent Value for $.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-07T21:53:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-08T06:54:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1255306374","name":"Syed Atif Ur Rahim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"501478359","name":"Mohammad Mikail Soomro"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAxNDc4MzU5","before":"MTI1NTMwNjM3NA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"515729898478165","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"Kolachi never disappoints!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-08T06:42:52+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"515730325144789","from":{"name":"Hareem Sumbul","id":"501415716"},"message":"Bohot din ho gayay. chalein?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-08T06:45:37+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"515730618478093","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"election ke baad?? kolachi se baithey tsunami dekhenge ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-08T06:47:03+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"515730738478081","from":{"name":"Hareem Sumbul","id":"501415716"},"message":"ELECTION?
