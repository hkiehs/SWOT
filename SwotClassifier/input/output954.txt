The menu was as per below: \n\nPasta Salad with sun dried tomatoes\nPotato Salad\nGreen Salad - lots of greens with grapefruit segments\n\nRoast beef with mushrooms, rocket, Dijon mustard and homemade chili jam\nGoat cheese with roasted bell pepper and pesto\nFig jam with turkey and blue cheese \nChicken tikka with Coleman mustard\n\nAll sandwiches were served on a French baguette, with potato wedges. A pretty neat idea - an alternative to heavy lunches we usually have. There was ample food for everyone. However, there is a little room for improvement. For starters, they can introduce the open-face sandwich for diet-conscious people in brown bread. Overall two thumbs up. Met Ayesha Nasir - thank you for being an extremely accommodating host.","type":"photo","created_time":"2012-01-20T11:15:58+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-21T06:23:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"},{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjkzNTk4MzU0","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"299933706724453","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Oh yummy - I miss not being able to have lunch.
