From the appetizers we ordered chilli garlic prawns and from the main course we ordered two Zesty Red Snappers and the Baked Fish ala Roma. The food was, by and large, bland. I can understand that the fish ala roma would be so because it specified that it would be cooked in garlic and butter with olives, but what happened to the zest in the red snapper? Another disappointment was the absence of sidelines with the fish ala roma – no sautéed vegetables, no potato, just sadness :( Compared to the snapper, this dish looked like a Kids Meal. What’s interesting, though, is that the presentation was impressive: they brought it in a big dish with a huge foiled bag on top. However, once you open that it’s a complete anti-climax because the fish looked tiny. My sincere suggestion would be to eliminate this sort of presentation because, really, why would you want your customers to have such a reaction? The prices have increased over the past couple of months, we felt, because majority of the dishes were over 1k. Now, if I’m paying Rs. 1200, on average, for a dish it should be *Aussie accent* a CRACKIN’ dish! These were not. We also ordered the chocolate cake for dessert, which was the saving grace of the entire meal because it really hit the sweet spot – just the right sort of chewy texture which, when broken into, oozes out delicious and warm chocolate and they served it with ice cream.  I suppose we would have been able to digest the earlier disappointment because of dessert but that disappeared within seconds after receiving the bill – Rs. 8500 *BANG* So beware, if you’re thinking of going to HLS, do keep a wad of cash or it’ll be an embarrassing situation. Now, I’m not sure if it was because of the bill or the fish, but I got back home extremely nauseous and woozy. I didn’t throw up though, but I crashed pretty bad and had horrific dreams. No more Ala-Roma-Anything for me!\n\nAnyway, I just got back from Xanders where we ordered:\n- French Toast (all day breakfast, hell yes!)\n- Mini Burgers (Absolutely adorable looking; cant comment on the taste since I didn’t try)\n- Pepperoni Pizza \n- A side of fries (always!)\n- Open chicken sandwich \n- Calamari\n- Parmesan Chicken (ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!!)\n- A large bottle of water, iced tea, coke\n- A slice of chocolate cake\n\nThe bill came to Rs. 4098. \n\nYes *GASP* it’s true! So turns out, that 15 minute is really worth it after all! Friday, however, will take me a while to recover from.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-07T18:36:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-09T06:30:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"3432614","name":"Shahfar Khan"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"100005879858955","name":"Hamayun Nisar"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"100003784320529","name":"Shahzad Saeed"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"682502588","name":"Mahin Khalid Siddiqui"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"573091981","name":"Hasan Masood Jafri"},{"id":"548651350","name":"Faizan Abbas"},{"id":"703321080","name":"Hafsah Naeem Ali"},{"id":"785615314","name":"Maleeha Jawaid"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5MjA0NTUy","before":"MzQzMjYxNA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"663242147060272","from":{"name":"Irfan Ali Siddiki","id":"703368408"},"message":"when it first opened, it was all pom pom, some of the operational operators were skeptical, the financials couldn\u0027t  justify; I was there initially but reading your post I think the brunt has hit them now, so smaller servings and savings on the taste serums, someone posted about the misbehave for the party booked as well.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-07T20:16:31+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"663243933726760","from":{"name":"Mohsin Arsalan","id":"554541726"},"message":"I had Chae and pappay for breakfast and studied throughout the day.
