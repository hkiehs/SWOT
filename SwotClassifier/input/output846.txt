You know you are dining in a classy place when an expensive dish you order just does not taste right (perhaps the fish was bad, perhaps the preparation was off or perhaps my taste buds were acting funny), you complain and instead of arguing with you or trying to prove you are a peasant who does not know better the management immediately apologize profusely and offer an alternative item. Such service and desire to please the customer are sorely wanting in our national dining scene! Thanks, Cafe Flo, for showing how a customer should be treated!
