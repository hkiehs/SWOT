Starters were very tasty with very stylish presentation, overall Good servings with excellent taste, my tarragon chicken was juicy and creamy, the way it should be, but then my husband Moiz Juddi gave me a bite from his steak and it was so heavenly that i regretted not ordering that! Veges were also full of taste. Chocolate lava cake shared with Amrah Tajik was good too, overall ill give this new place in town 8/10.
