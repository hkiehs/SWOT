Out of boredom (and end of month scenario), I ordered Grilled chicken burgers with caramelised onions for me and my parents and I swear to you, if I had not known the location and the burger was dressed up on a plate, I would have imagined it coming from a GBC or Arizona. The bun was soft and fresh, the chicken was not at all dry, it came apart on the slightest bite and the caramelised onions were divine. Along with a cheese sauce I ordered slathered on fries and in the burger, I was in burger heaven. And all for the price of ....... Drum Roll please, Rs.160 per box and a grand total of ...Rs.540 for three burger and french fries. These burgers have made me a true believer of the fact, Anyone and even anyplace from a humble beginning can cook.

But today i reached TBS at 8:05, wanted to place a order but they told me they have stopped taking orders and I can place my order after prayers. I was waiting there, when i saw two girls come out to their car to place an order. And to my surprise both of them were successfully able to place their order \u0026 the owner was standing there and witnessing the whole event. Once they had placed their order the owner was angry at the person at the counter that he was not suppose to take the order. After that i moved to the order counter to place my order again and owner told me again its closed, my problem here is when he was standing there and witnessing the whole event he could have interfered and stopped the order from the girls or could have taken my order as well. When i argued him about this the excuse he gave me was the lamest excuse i have heard. \"Women can not stand outside so we take orders from them\". While the girls were driving themselves they could easily come back after a while, this is definitely a dual policy.
