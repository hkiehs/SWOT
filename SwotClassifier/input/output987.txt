I know that there was a buffet with lots of things, but I do not know what was else on it because I concentrated on the oven roasted turkey, mashed potatoes and stuffing. The gravy was good but I was disappointed with the cranberry sauce which was not jellied and quite runny. That said, the turkey and trimmings were delicious ... and I unashamedly made the most of it even surprising myself at how much I ate!! The christmas pudding with hot vanilla sauce should have been left well alone but was too enticing to do so. Therefore, it had to be enjoyed too and was.
