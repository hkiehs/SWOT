Ordered the deal for 4 and the person taking the order ( I\u0027m sure was Mr Asim) was patient about my concern with the spice content, he ensured the Chillie Chicken( gravy) will be mild and on my request he suggested I swap the spicy chowmein with chicken chowmain. Delivery time was 9pm (ordered at 7:57) and the bell rang at 8:45!! yippee. Food was as usual piping hot. Today I found the chowmein to be perfectly seasoned, rice was good, the chillie chicken ( dry) was tasty, chicken toast was a discovery as I had never eaten it before and my daughter and her friend really enjoyed it. The best dish was the Chillie Chicken Gravy which was just perfect. Today for a change we didnt have any leftovers and unhappy as usually we enjoy the leftover Chinese the next day :) This also proves how good the food was !!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-22T19:12:07+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-23T17:35:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1531779763","name":"Najaf Raoon"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"514290400","name":"Hirah Sid"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"514292991","name":"Marium Hosein"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1415702282","name":"Sadia Bilwani"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcwMTAwMTk4","before":"MTUzMTc3OTc2Mw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"426935224024300","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Farhat:Your reviews are a treat to read \u003c3\u003c3\u003c3...Thanks ever so much.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-22T21:01:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat","type":"user","offset":0,"length":6}]},{"id":"426937540690735","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"QA : A total GD freak i\u0027m and thank you for not letting me down consistently:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-22T21:08:34+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"427007844017038","from":{"name":"Romano Karim Yusuf","id":"832750315"},"message":"Farhat!!
