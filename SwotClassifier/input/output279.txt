We ordered beef behari boti, chicken reshmi kebab, chicken garlic mayo roll and hot \u0026 sour soup as I was craving for it. They promised to deliver within 45 minutes however it was delivered after an hour. And well, they messed up the order too. Instead of chicken reshmi kebab and beef behari boti, they delivered chicken behari boti and beef reshmi kebab. But oh boy, I am glad they messed up the order. Beef reshmi kebab were one of the best I have ever had in K-town. Beef just melted in the mouth and it was full of flavors. Chicken behari boti was juicy and full of flavors too. Both dishes were finished within 5 minutes :) Garlic mayo roll was just okay probably because it was only warm and paratha lacked the crispiness. Hot \u0026 sour soup was absolutely a no no as it tasted more like liquified ketchup having extra ordinary spices. However, the quantity of chicken in the soup was quite impressive. Overall it was a good experience with behari chicken and beef.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-17T18:43:16+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-17T20:21:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"515599528","name":"Muhammad Fahad"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"100001822097920","name":"Sara Kazmi"},{"id":"515558572","name":"Sameer Mirjat"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE1NTU4NTcy","before":"MTA3NjI4NTIxNQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"604738656243955","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"I loved the beef kababs and the imli ki chutney, and the mayo roll :-D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-17T19:18:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"604745699576584","from":{"name":"Syed Wamiq Haider","id":"514714415"},"message":"Naa...
