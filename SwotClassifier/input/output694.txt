I believe in not blacklisting any food item completely. I try to have everything I like, in small portions.\n\nHowever the problem I face is that the serving sizes are usually quite large, espcially desserts . For example, I would like to have a 150ml Coke (it is available, but hard to find). Or half scoop of ice cream. Or half a slice of my favorite cake. Or half of my favorite burger (with reduced bun size).\n\nIn this scenario, the choices I am left with include giving up the item completely, leaving the unused half, or having the full item and feeling guilty later.\n\nSo, how about if restaurants start offering half sizes of popular dishes, reducing the amount of bread from the burgers and so on?

Everything was good, yes good not poor neither exceptional. When it comes to buffet dinner the names Lal Qila, Al Boston and Village arises in your mind and if you compare them with mirage then sorry to say mirage will loose when compared to taste and especially the variety of foods. When asked from the manager that how come they don\u0027t have ice cream or at least kulfa I was replied with the answer that they are not good for the throat in winter. However the best thing about mirage is its sea view and peaceful dining experience, too bad I was accompanied with a wife and two toddlers, otherwise it would had been a great venue if I was on a date, what can be more romantic then a beautiful girl in front and the calm blue sea on the left, so I have made up my mind to go their again with my wife when my kids have grown enough to be home alone. Now according to Swots rule you are only allowed to express about the food to make sure that ones opinion does not effect the whole and I fully accept that so in the end I would only say that the gravity of food flavor greatly depends upon the environment and company you are carrying with you and I\u0027m quite sure that many of you will enjoy their dinning experience more than I had.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-09T05:24:38+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-09T08:29:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3Mjg3Mzkz","before":"NTE3Mjg3Mzkz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"470277369690085","from":{"name":"Zubair Uddin","id":"704566421"},"message":"not good for throat....lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-09T08:29:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDcwMjc3MzY5NjkwMDg1","before":"NDcwMjc3MzY5NjkwMDg1"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_469906913060464","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Been trying to orde something off Urbanite Pk for the past 38 mins and 22 seconds,\n\nBeen thru 12 different menses - found nothing I wan to come home to tonight, \n\nAm open to suggestion.......has to be light.
