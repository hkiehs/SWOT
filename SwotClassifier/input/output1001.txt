Decided on ordering the food from Arab Connection. Placed the order for Belly Dancer and Beefita / Chickita. On a brighter the service was excellent and the food arrived on the time they had committed. Another plus point would that the food is very very reasonably priced. \n\nThe Belly Dancer which is a replacement of sort of shawarmas was a disappointment. I thought it would have the authentic taste of Middle East as claimed on their facebook page, it was nowhere to be found. It was nothing like the shawarmas that are served in Saudi Arabia. SWOTTIES who have been for Umrah / Hajj would probably know what I am talking about as it has a very specific taste which I have yet to sample in Pakistan. \n\nThe Beefita / Chickita was at best, average. The taste was bland though it did have a decent serving. The only good thing about the meal was their dipping sauces aka the three wishes. The fries that came along were sort of a replica of the fries found at the likes of Kaybees or Red Apple. Basically they change colours in a few hours if you do not consume them. \n\nThough the place has been getting good reviews my experience was a little disappointing. I do not think I\u0027d be ordering from them any time soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-16T15:44:32+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-17T07:05:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100000578236531","name":"Naheed Asim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNTc4MjM2NTMx","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"278913335493157","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"I ordered from there last week.

Ordered the starter of the Charcoal Platter consisting of fried chicken slices with cheese, fish fingers, chicken wings \u0026 deep fried button mushrooms served with 4 dippers. That plate was emptied within mintues by 3 adults \u0026 3 kids - verdict - yummy n felt like ordering more!\n\nMain courses:\n\n1) Mushroom Steak with mashed potatoes - It was beef, juicy and well done, served withg fantastic taste of mashied potatoes.\n\n2) Fish \u0026 Chip - 2 slices of fish fillets served with salad and fries. Quite a serving that my mom still had 1 sliced left coz she was too full. Served with tartar sauce and a dipper for the fries which was really crispy.\n\n3) Charcoal Mix Platter - enough for 2 - Grilled prawns wz sliced capsicum, small slice of lemon and onion - a lil spicy but not desi :) Steak with sauce, again juicy n yummy. Fish fillet - crispy on the outside but soft in the inside, chicken piece with white sauce - no complain and lastly their awesome mashed potatoes!\n\n4) Popcorn Chicken with fries (kiddy meal) - Big popcorn chicken deep fried just nice, crispy and juice and yummy fries that was served with it with the dipper. Had to order another one coz the elder son didnt want to share! :)\n\nDesserts -\n\n1) Brownie - Big chunk of brownie served in a tall glass, surrounded with yummy ice cream vanilla ice cream, huge portion, can be shared.\n\n2) Chocolate Mousse - smooth and chocolatey at the right amount.\n\n3) Cheesecake with caramel - Delish and with the caramel on top it added just the right amount of sweetness to it,just perfect to end our evening by the sea.\n\nGreat service, ambiance and definitely worth a visit.

The stir fry along with the steamed rice tasted fine but then again it was nothing to write home about. Everyone I went with had a problem with the portion size and some of the food tasted bland as well so we eventually left feeling unfulfilled, disgruntled and hungry.

Bland food, value for money, a little extra, small things to complete a dish and personalized service are VERY IMPORTANT to make a new joint take off.My advice to restaurant owners is don\u0027t look at reaping back what you have sown the first day the restaurant opens, give it some time, twelve to eighteen months, give it your best shot, establish yourself in the market, address customer complaints, make changes and woo customers, who may be disgruntled and not completely satisfied. We have seen so many success stories, which had quite some negative reviews early, like CBG, like Olivetto, Okra, Cafe 9, The Deli, and many others, their owners and management took pains and worked hard to redefine their image and achieve success and carve a niche for themselves. The owners and operators of Cafe 44 and Xanders need to realize that Rome was certainly not conquered in one day and customer is the King, the only way that they can achieve success is continuous evolution and improvement. We can SWOT it anytime but the owners and management should commits to fine tuning and bring themselves up to the required level. I hope this topic stands concluded from critique point of view.
