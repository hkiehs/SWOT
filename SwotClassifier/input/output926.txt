I found it a tad bit too salty, but my husband loved it! For the main course we ordered beef medallions and ravioli and both courses were delicious! A good meal overall, we left the restaurant feeling very full and content.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-05T08:35:22+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-05T13:22:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"505630511","name":"Maliha Tariq-Ahmad"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"},{"id":"502572519","name":"Shaheer Mehkari"},{"id":"61308574","name":"Owais Ali"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nzc3NjQ3ODAy","before":"NTA0MDkzOTk3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"373155389402284","from":{"name":"Maliha Tariq-Ahmad","id":"505630511"},"message":"Olivetto has the BEST beef medallions.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-05T10:35:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"373230002728156","from":{"name":"Afroza Bhamani","id":"846664538"},"message":"Thank You Komal, thank You Maliha...we try!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-05T13:22:36+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"501891633","name":"Komal","type":"user","offset":10,"length":5},{"id":"505630511","name":"Maliha","type":"user","offset":27,"length":6}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MzczMjMwMDAyNzI4MTU2","before":"MzczMTU1Mzg5NDAyMjg0"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_373059889411834","from":{"name":"Ayesha Mohammed","id":"8000747"},"message":"Where can I get cupcake stands on rent for today?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-05T06:06:33+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-05T12:46:54+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"373120362739120","from":{"name":"Sadiyah Ahmed","id":"826050057"},"message":"Aamina Jahangir","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-05T08:52:33+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"501859943","name":"Aamina Jahangir","type":"user","offset":0,"length":15}]},{"id":"373179506066539","from":{"name":"Danish Khan","id":"100002226730780"},"message":"www.facebook.com/bakersparadise","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-05T11:36:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"373179662733190","from":{"name":"Danish Khan","id":"100002226730780"},"message":"they have all the baking supplies!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-05T11:36:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"373212349396588","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"search for sweetakery ok facebook","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-05T12:46:54+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MzczMjEyMzQ5Mzk2NTg4","before":"MzczMTIwMzYyNzM5MTIw"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_373113522739804","from":{"name":"Farah S.

Used to love the place. \n ordered the following: \"\n- 1/2 oven roasted chicken with gravy: lovely flavour but the chicken size was more of a quarter than a 1/.2 chicken. was a complete half chicken, no doubt, but the chicken itself was tiny. nice creamy mushroomy-hinted gravy. well done chicken. lovely perfect potato wedges. good meal. \n- thai red curry with prawns: unquestionably still among the Deli\u0027s best offerings and compared to commercial competition i would choose this item from their menu any given day. always a good order. \n- Meditteranean chili garlic prawn pasta: here\u0027s the thing. when i order something meditteranean, i expect the flavour to be lightly buttery+olive oil based, and therefore a present flavour. the chili needs to be hinted, the garlic well roasted in the butter and flavour. thats the meditteranean flavour im aware of. what i got was  a well spicy pasta, no hint of butter or olive oil make its burst of flavours and tiny splinters of parmesan. The result. it was more like a Singaporean / Thai infused fettuccine pasta. I was disappointed because of the difference in flavour. and the spice level was strong. Mind you i eat dark green thin 3 inch long green chillies very comfortably. So if i found this dish spicy and not remotely Mediterranean then please do excuse me for being confused about my flavours and im quite sure im not. im also very sure my tastebuds are quite alive. \n- strawberry surprise was a nice blended drink of strawberries, ice and orange juice. thoroughly refreshing not very sweet. quite pleasant. \n- Rabab\u0027s Lindt Chocolate Cappuccino Brownie   - good brownie. moist. erm. cappuccino: not so much. very chocolatey. so erm. myenh on the brownie. the accompanying ice-cream though: \u003dD GRIN!!!! pure vanilla bean ice cream. joyfullness. delight! so beautiful. so silky. so light. so delicious. \n\nthe garlic bread served on the house as a prelude to our meal was perhaps the biggest disappointment. very thick slices of baguette bathed in butter and baked so much the bread became a biscuit. was there garlic or oregano to call it a garlic bread: na-uh.was so bland it reminded me of BBC Food\u0027s \"cant cook wont cook\" \u003c- only either of such chefs can mess up a garlic bread to not have any flavour at all.  \n\nThe Deli after 3 years was a moderate experience. i was slightly disappointed because it was always my place of surely-good-meals. some saving graces could not offset the disappointments here and there. \n\nthey forgot to give us their sandwich menu. have always loved their meditteranean chicken sandwich and 7 hours later am still sad i didnt order this over the pasta.  no complaints on service, cutlery or crockery otherwise.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-04T17:19:00+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-05T08:21:00+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"585622689","name":"Naveed Ismail"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"603490700","name":"Mariam Bilgrami"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAxNDE1NzE2","before":"NTg1NjIyNjg5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"372682129449610","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"What an AWESOME review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-04T18:30:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372703736114116","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"*wide eyed. blush* thank you :$","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-04T19:07:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"373109459406877","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Deli, is in fine form... must revisit.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-05T08:21:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MzczMTA5NDU5NDA2ODc3","before":"MzcyNjgyMTI5NDQ5NjEw"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_372425902808566","from":{"name":"Shahzad Qureshi","id":"626900866"},"message":"Sadly, TUC\u0027s famed Belgian Chocolate Froyo is no more...  it is now RossMore powdered chocolate softserve icecream... happened twice in a row.

Our waiter (Javad) is something truly exceptional.  He remembers our names, our favourite dishes, and has yet to tell us \"No\" for any request. \n\nB - They cook probably the finest steaks around town.  Whether you order the medallion, the tenderloin, or the rack of lamb (cheating this isn\u0027t a steak); they UNDERSTAND their meat.  Do you want medium rare? They\u0027ll give you medium rare.  This is an international standard being upheld.  \n\nC- There has never been an issue with quality.  The standards have always EXCEEDED my expectations. The layout is gorgeous, the temperature is always just right, and they go out of their way to take care of you if come in sick. \n\nD- Pricing is fantastic.  Cafe Flo\u0027, Dynasty, and Saffron charge an extra 10% on top of the 16% GST.  This brings the total to a hilarious 26% plus tip.  I\u0027ve began to notice others following this trend.  Olivetto not only looks the part, but the prices are competitive when competing against the dinosaurs of Karachi Lifestyle dining.\n\nI just want to tip my hat to Afroza Bhamani and Afroze Khan. You have created something truly special.  Please wait for my full review. \n\nI thank you for your time.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-05T07:34:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-05T07:34:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"586043191","name":"Mustafa Mohomedally"},{"id":"100000093496883","name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"1137915284","name":"Mohammad Bin Zia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzNzkxNTI4NA\u003d\u003d","before":"NTA0MDkzOTk3"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_372778969439926","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Ordered delivery from Golden Dragon: Order was taken so professionally, food was delivered before the time was up ..i know as my daughter put a stop watch:) she loved the fried shrimps and rice crackers while l enjoyed the Hot \u0026 spicy chicken...a little too hot for me but next time will try the one with the pineappale ad the new dish with the peanuts for sure.and oh yes....amazing servings..enough for 3 people.

When people started being negative about Aylanto, I wanted to give them another chance to see if it was really that bad now. Our first experience at the new place was a C+ so I could not understand the horrible reviews they were getting. So, being a glutton for punishment, I took Mariyam Masood there for lunch today. Sigh, what can I say that it was a complete and utter disappointment! First, the positives. Good greeting at the door, polite waiters, cold water, fresh bread and courteous damage control. Unfortunately that is where it stops! Ordered the French Onion soup which actually was not too bad the last time but microscopic cheese on two pieces of french bread thrown in at the last minute so they were hard. When I sent it back, because at the time of the order I specified that I wanted it to be smothered in melting cheese, it returned with some additional grated but unmelted cheese. Strike One! Mariyam\u0027s Tarragon Chicken, which she loved at the old Aylanto, was two skinny pieces of chicken unable to really remain juicy or retain flavour. Strike Two! My steak was ordered medium rare and came medium well. Was replaced with one that was more like medium but by then I did not want to waste any more time or food and dutifully ate the average tasting steak. Strike Three! To their credit, one of their managers came to check when he had been told I was unhappy with our food and I shared my concerns with him. He was very apologetic and despite my repeated requests to the contrary, removed the soup and steak from the bill ... which made me very uncomfortable since that was not my intent in speaking with him. I told him that they really need to focus on their food if they are to stem the negative tide and he was receptive to the feedback. He requested that we return and he would personally take charge of our orders. However, unfortunately that is not what we want from any restaurant. Sure, people do take care of us at places we go to but then that is in their nature for ALL their customers, not just us. Overall, being a charitable person, I hope that they can return to the standards of yesteryear because at the moment, I find it very hard to point myself in the direction of Aylanto again. And that is a damn shame since I did enjoy my occasional visits there. The top management and owners have to take charge and do something because even a blind guy like me can see the problems screaming at me! Sorry Aylanto, I really am. I wanted to be positive and see hope but since things are sliding since my last visit, there is genuine cause for concern.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-04T10:18:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-04T18:07:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"603103229","name":"Danish Munir"},{"id":"698366264","name":"Ahsan R.
