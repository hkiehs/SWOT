I recieved the order in little above half an hour after i placed it.\nIt came in quite simple packaging yet look attractive.i opted to finish my fries first which are nothing to write about. The.burger was however tempting.it had flavour in its every bite. The burger was gigantic and spicy and pleasing to eyes.\n\nNow today after a hectic day of runnning around for shopping for 10 hours!! My cousin and i were craving for something good. We left it to fate and went to burger shack. We placed ordet for two grilled jalapeno burgers with combos.after waiting for about 25 mins we got our order.starting with fries(its a habit i finish my fries first)they were simply awesome. The curly texture and their thickness ahhhh.\nThe burger lived upto its name. Although the brest fillet that was inside the buns was somewhat small it filled up my tummy completely. \nI guess i wont be going to mcdonalds anymore :/","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-21T18:46:19+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-22T11:00:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000316454503","name":"Mukesh Kumar"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"755325547","name":"Aswad Javeri"},{"id":"100004401815837","name":"Nikki Fidai"},{"id":"769030393","name":"Muhammad Danniyal Jafri"},{"id":"1322557664","name":"Paras Alam"},{"id":"783958571","name":"Rabia Rajput"},{"id":"100003698171140","name":"Asra Mushtaq"},{"id":"100000250557469","name":"Pardeep Kumar"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjcyMDkyMw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTAwMDAwMzE2NDU0NTAz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"637827316268422","from":{"name":"Syeda Tehseen Zehra Naqvi","id":"100002971695699"},"message":"Why you people hate mc donalds? :/","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-21T19:18:48+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637835082934312","from":{"name":"Saleha Haroon","id":"730135456"},"message":"Where is burger shack","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-21T19:42:18+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637837186267435","from":{"name":"Ahmed Zaheer Sheikh","id":"100001265797707"},"message":"which burger shack you are talking about saleha?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-21T19:48:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637845076266646","from":{"name":"??? ?????","id":"514472890"},"message":"Burger Shack is the bomb","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-21T20:14:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637845712933249","from":{"name":"Fatima Zahra","id":"1457902576"},"message":"Everyone finishes their fries first, dont they?
