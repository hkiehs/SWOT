The place was full as usual and despite our reservations, we were made to wait for 20 mins..... While waiting we observed that the reception desk staff was really rude to the customers. seemingly, they had no training or grooming on how to greet and handle customers.\nWe ordered drumsticks for starters and they were really nice.... They didn\u0027t have napkins on the table and when we asked, they said that due to heavy weekend traffic they were all out of napkins, so we were given a tissue box.\nOrdered 2 hot and sour soups (one red and one white), red was ok but the white one was just plain bland... Ordered kindo fish, Kung pao chicken, garlic prawns and red emperor chicken....\nAmongst all the four dishes, the kindo fish was eatable, but rest of the food was bland, bad in taste... And emperor chicken was raw, the batter wasn\u0027t cooked properly... The waiter came and asked us about the food, and we said k it\u0027s bad and instead of listening to us, he started defending and telling us this is how Chinese food is :) in the end I got so fed up that I simply told him not to ask us if he doesn\u0027t want to hear honest feedback.. Not going there ever and would never recommend this place to anyone... Go to yuan tung instead, much better food.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-19T15:24:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-19T15:24:05+0000"},{"id":"165861103465048_605847376133083","from":{"name":"Abdul Wajid Qureshi","id":"530060365"},"type":"photo","created_time":"2013-08-19T14:38:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-19T14:38:54+0000","picture":"http://photos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/1146561_668626426481707_1616832650_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d668626426481707\u0026set\u003da.540873519256999.134834.540859575925060\u0026type\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_605832576134563","from":{"name":"Filza Hai","id":"889085130"},"message":"China kitchen..
