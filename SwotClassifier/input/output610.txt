No establishment is perfect, we all make mistakes, and condemning us for a few small flaws occasionally is a bit extreme.\nAs put best by Lincoln “You can please some of the people all of the time, you can please all of the people some of the time, but you can’t please all of the people all of the time”.\nWe appreciate all constructive criticism and never retaliate in a childlike manner to the ill-manners of patrons who do not follow the same guidelines that they so freely impose on us.

It is obviously in our best interest to provide high quality service, which is why keep a set menu.

In the middle our gas went to next to nothing for about half an hour (not using that as an excuse). Once a few orders back up, well its a lot like the domino effect during rush hour. It should be rather obvious that we have no intention of  providing bad service or giving anyone a less than perfect experience. If that was the case, then Im pretty sure then we\u0027re in the wrong industry. Iit was a rather overwhelming response that night and some issues did occur. That being said, being a restaurant we dont penalize guests when the make reservations for a certain time and casually walk in half an hour late. Sure, it makes life difficult for us - but hey thats what hospitality is all about to provide excellent service.

The long shelf life is due to UHT and nothing else which is 6-9 months anywhere in the world, its actually lower in PK as not all milk is immediately sent to chiller at the farms. What we get in other countries is pasteurized or fresh milk, shelf life for the former is a week and the latter is lesser. Pasteurized is the preferred form of milk as it maintains taste while UHT does not. Day Fresh is pasteurized and other companies would like to do the same but shelf life isn\u0027t maintained due to load shedding hence large scale hasn\u0027t been possible.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T15:15:47+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"508020015915820","from":{"name":"Hammad Umer","id":"622355253"},"message":"His bottom line was, if it were that bad, why would i give it to my family.
