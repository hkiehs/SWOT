Went to Café Blue Ginger and having been there before I was looking forward to good food . . . did I get it? Yes I did and my guest absolutely loved the décor, ambiance and the food of course . . . \n\nThe bread basket was as usual fresh and appetizing, for starters we had the Potato and Leek soup which we both liked. Chicken with smoked tomato sauce with spaghetti was phenomenal and Dj despite being a fastidious person ate all of it, which was enough a proof that it was delicious, I ordered the Herb crusted fish which came with amazing sauce to go with it . . . The Lemon Lime Margarita was in one word EPIC, we both loved it . . .\n\nThe only thing that was a bummer was the dessert, I found the Molten Lava great in the way it looked, the texture and all but the did it hit the right nodes with it’s chocolatiness ? Sadly it didn’t . . . I understand one can’t please all the palates and for a fact mine needs a lot of refinement to go but I found it a little too sweet and kinda Ovaltin-ish/Milo-ish . . . But then neither of us have sweet tooth so we returned happy, satisfied and satiated","type":"status","created_time":"2012-10-30T18:50:40+0000","updated_time":"2012-10-30T20:34:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ2NjY0NTM4","before":"MTA3NjI4NTIxNQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"453657861352036","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Asher Jamal - Thank you for the lovely praise ...

Most of them are not local. We ordered Mutton Biryani, Chicken Handi and Lab-e-Shireen from Food Centre and Kunna from Advance Food Centre at Phase 2 (as recommended by some of the hub\u0027s friends). For biryani and Kunna, we provided the meat for these 2 dishes. \n\nFood centre guy told us that they will cook 7kg of meat and 5kg of rice for our guests of about 50 people (adults + children), 4kg Chicken Handi and 4kg Lab-e-Shireen. As for Kunna, we ordered a 5kg one.\n\nI am happy to mention here that Food Centre and Advance Food Centre did a really good job. The biryani was so delicious with just the right taste of spices, not too spicy and it just got that \"kick\" when u eat it, everyone was praising it and some even asked me for their contact no. Chicken Handi was a hit too and not forgetting the dessert, which was also whipped up in no time. Kunna was good too though some of them prefer the Kunna they had tried at Chiniot Pakwan.\n\nOverall a great experience ordering from both and most important of all, the guests left with a smile on their faces :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-10-30T11:24:00+0000","updated_time":"2012-10-30T11:25:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzNTIzNjMzOQ\u003d\u003d","before":"MTA5ODQwOTE3MQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"453423278042161","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"Love food centre !!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-10-30T11:25:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDUzNDIzMjc4MDQyMTYx","before":"NDUzNDIzMjc4MDQyMTYx"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_453261898058299","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"This page makes me hungry everytime I visit it. -_-","type":"status","created_time":"2012-10-30T00:46:40+0000","updated_time":"2012-10-30T11:05:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1553621640","name":"Lybha Nadeem"},{"id":"541545690","name":"Natasha Baig"},{"id":"653236681","name":"Sufia Waseem"},{"id":"513456477","name":"Mehwish Owais"},{"id":"100002785190370","name":"Vseem Gaved"},{"id":"509259631","name":"Sarah Kanji"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"704838209","name":"Mahvish Jabeen"},{"id":"530485619","name":"Hana Faisal"},{"id":"575820034","name":"Maheen Kamran"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTc1ODIwMDM0","before":"MTU1MzYyMTY0MA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"453322984718857","from":{"name":"Nighat Khan","id":"573859815"},"message":"Are you kidding, I haven\u0027t been able to shed those 5 kgs, instead crept up a couple:((","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-10-30T04:20:24+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"453340998050389","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Everytime I come here I end up reading reviews and ordering.

And they provided us with a sweet and sour sauce to go with the hot chillie one s that complemented the fried items well. \n\nIt was 1100/- per person including drink, mineral water and tip. \n\nAll in all NOT a bad afternoon.......but I think the place is more popular for those who order the beer, coz otherwise the food was just above average nothing too look forward to or plan for in advance. \n\nHeaded to Koel for chai and dessert but that\u0027s another post.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-10-29T12:05:47+0000","updated_time":"2012-10-30T10:48:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"519619487","name":"Shajiaah Jafri Ahmad"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk0MjM4NzQy","before":"NTE5NjE5NDg3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"452987791419043","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Snaps Har, Shaikh Fawad, Mahvash Siddiqi Khan","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-10-29T12:06:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har","type":"user","offset":0,"length":9},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad","type":"user","offset":11,"length":12}]},{"id":"452989488085540","from":{"name":"Faysal Khan","id":"681347288"},"message":"Vein insitu???? for heavens sake Nezihe, you\u0027re writing about food...LOL...once a surgeon, always a surgeon!!
