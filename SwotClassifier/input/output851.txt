Had been several weeks since i had been.....good thing since every thing seemed new....noticed a few new faces and of course the old ones. \n\nPacked to capacity with familes celebrating Father\u0027s Day, they were run off their feet but still smiling and attentive (except towards the end - when they toookkkk aaaagggggeesss to get the dessert) \n\nWhat did we order.....Antipasti platter - should have clicked but was too busy digging in, then CBG salad, chicken skewers in teriyaki sauce, fettucini alfredo with prawns and lots of parmesan, tenderloin medium, and chargrilled burger. The dessert was plum sorbet, and mango creme brulee.\n\nEverything was well cooked, tasted great and presented well. Loved the fresh taste of the plum sorbet but mango brulee i didnt like. Thu the custard was smooth and silky....a) it was warm b) didnt like the mango in the custard....the mango puree on topnwas perfect - would have been better if the custard was good old fashioned vanilla and just topped some fresh slices and coolie.\n\nAll in all a great evening.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-17T19:49:29+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-18T07:15:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002443457242","name":"Daktur Ali"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"100000093496883","name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI1OTY4OTUz","before":"MTAwMDAyNDQzNDU3MjQy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"399552156762607","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Nezihe Hussain Great seeing you with Aunty, Asmer Naim Sb and De Joe  tonight!!
