The pastries over there were divine , I had the rasberry cheescake and the caramel eclairs WOWZA! They\u0027re pretty pricey at around SAR 10 - 15 a piece but totally worth it. You can also buy a cup of Coffee over there , so it makes for a great breakfast. There are loads of small ghetto-ish looking Turkish Cafe\u0027s in Makkah they do awesome \"Doner Kebabs\" \"Iskander Kebabs\" and \"Qabsa\" definitely head to one of them ask any local in the city where the nearest \"MATAM TURKIYE\"  (Arabic for Turkish Restaurant) is . There are a bunch of Sudanese and various African run establishments slightly away from the Haram circle look for the signs saying \"FUUL\" (in Arabic) , just for being adventurous try Fuul its like an African delicacy made of beans, chickpeas and various spices .  If by any chance you start to miss Pakistani food head to the Hotel Ravi in Madinah its right across the street from Al Baik if I am not wrong there\u0027s only one Al Baik in Madinah. OMG that place does the best Pakistani food I\u0027ve had outside Pakistan , great Chicken Karahi , Chicken Achari and by far the best Lassi I\u0027ve ever had (seriously even Lahore couldn\u0027t beat it ). One word of advice the best food in both of the cities is in areas slightly away from the respective Haram circles. If you plan to stay within the Haram areas then your choices are restricted to the cliche  Starbucks, KFC, McD\u0027s , Hardees , Baskin \u0026 Robbins and really really bad Shawarma\u0027s .
