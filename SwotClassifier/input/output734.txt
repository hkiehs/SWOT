OMG! They were just divine!!! Soft, gooey, with perfect amount of chocolate. Loved the big chunks of chocolates ( I had ordered Kitkat, Toblerone, cadbury and Ferrero Rocher). My personal favorite was the Ferrero Rocher. And honestly, they were actually quite big! One of the best cupcakes I have had.

Even though the place was packed to its full capacity, our company of 3 was accommodated without a reservation, after a short wait ... As my friend from NY wanted to have something desi, so I ordered Chicken Makhni \u0026 Garlic \u0026 Roghni nan to accompany it, the other friend wanted to have a sandwich but was unsure, what type, reluctantly she ordered the grilled sandwich... even after the placed order our server noticed the apprehension on my friends face,went \u0026 asked his Chef (Noor) to help us with the issue at hand :p.... Anyway Noor was the most humble guy, he inquired my friend what type of a sandwich she would like, after getting a description, he went \u0026 cooked up this most amazing nanwich, that I have ever tried (My experience with Koel has been super bad).... The chicken in the sandwich was succulent, cooked in tomato puree, mushroom, onions, with a pinch of mexican spices \u0026 garam masala.... Noor personally came back to the table \u0026 inquired if will liked it \u0026 we were like this is something we would be coming for over \u0026 over again... He also told us that he was from gilgit/hunza side \u0026 that he was part of the show Foodistan as well....All in all the chat along with the food was quiet interesting.... He is a great guy! and genius of a chef!!\n\nNow coming to the makhni, unlike the makhni handi I have tried at numerous places this particular dish was different...  Instead of just being buttery, it packed a punch with spices which were not overpowering but would hit the back of the palate in a pleasant manner... I loved it!!!... \n\nOne thing that I forgot to mention, remember that grilled sandwich, that order was never cancelled by the server, so in the end, that too landed up on our table..We did tell them that this was cancelled because of the nanawich but Chef Noor again came on our table \u0026 insisted that the naanwich was on the house...Anyway coming to the sandwich, the salad, the chicken marination, the bread used were all fresh \u0026 tasted light \u0026 wonderful... \n\nKolachi brownie points:\n\nLocation (Sea of course)\nAmbiance (Gorgeous)\nService (Impeccable/Hospitable)\nFood (Amazing)\nPricing (We paid 2100 inclusive of tip for 3 people \u0026 had drinks too)\n\nI was officially in food coma last night after my visit to the place.... (So were my friends)\n\nWill I be going there again? \n\nHELL YES!!!\n\nKolachi truly Rocks!!!\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/KolachiSpiritofkarachi?fref\u003dts","type":"status","created_time":"2012-10-28T07:14:17+0000","updated_time":"2012-10-28T09:47:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"751030900","name":"Zoha Manzar"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"690005614","name":"Owais Asif"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"},{"id":"724851212","name":"Mahvash Siddiqi"},{"id":"1360134242","name":"Fahima Mubashir"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"888075011","name":"Nayyer Rauf"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"828190023","name":"Shaheen Nouman"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk0MjM4NzQy","before":"MTEzNTIzNjMzOQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"452531154798040","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"mene be naan-which chahiyeh...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-10-28T08:50:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"452531381464684","from":{"name":"Luciferz Angel","id":"792470170"},"message":"Ask for Chef Noor, I am positive he will accommodate your request as the naanwich is not part of the menu","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-10-28T08:51:16+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"452532651464557","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"thanks for the heads-up and the details and reference, Angel... most people keep such info to themselves and dont share...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-10-28T08:56:16+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"792470170","name":"Angel","type":"user","offset":55,"length":5}]},{"id":"452534784797677","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"I can\u0027t believe you went without me!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-10-28T09:03:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"452535284797627","from":{"name":"Luciferz Angel","id":"792470170"},"message":"babes, I did call you but as usual you didn\u0027t pick up :(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-10-28T09:05:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"452535381464284","from":{"name":"Hirah Sid","id":"514290400"},"message":"u shd definately try their Lahori fish...i never liked Lahori fish till i tried theirs..n BarBque prawns too...cooked to perfection!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-10-28T09:06:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"452535661464256","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Hmmmm likely story!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-10-28T09:07:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"452535764797579","from":{"name":"Luciferz Angel","id":"792470170"},"message":"I am not kidding, ask Ira :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-10-28T09:07:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"452544918129997","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100003681493822"},"message":"Peshawari mutton karahi is great too.n yes no doubt their service has been constantly attentive n great ever since they hv opened up..they hv maintained their service skills.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-10-28T09:47:50+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDUyNTQ0OTE4MTI5OTk3","before":"NDUyNTMxMTU0Nzk4MDQw"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_452492551468567","from":{"name":"Solo Atif","id":"680225215"},"message":"Stepped out yesterday with a few people to Verde. What a wonderful break from the norm, both aesthetically and food wise, or for the limited items we tried at least. Its location is away from the hustle bustle and as soon as you step in, what blew me away was the plants all around. We aren\u0027t talking about the potted variety only mind you, but the lush garden like ambiance which Karachi good weather can make even more awesome! Opting to sit outside because of the weather, I rather enviously kept glancing at the see through glass, which was more or less the inside!!Futuristic and classy in one go! The massive fan did sort of freeze me, but if it was off, I am guessing mosquitoes would have a field day!\n\nGot the basil and tomato soup. Rich and velvety, with the right smell and hint of herbs..not to over whelming..it has been a while since I tried something like that..with the croutons still crunchy enough to have a bite, and the cream dollops just about the right quantity! My brother and husband raved about the coffee, which they said was just right, strong enough..just to keep the edge..but at the same time just right!\n\nI know next time I am home, I will make a beeline to Verde, because it seems like a pretty unique concept and after the cramped, crammed to the extreme zamzama places..something so in touch with Nature both inside and outside ..well that just seems just what we need in karachi!!
