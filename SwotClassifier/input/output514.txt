Its super duper yummy! Also saw the election freebie posts...damn i wish i could have come online earlier!!! Missed them all :-( Did go to Espresso and PITS (after hearing some girls in the line that there is something there) but i got done at 8:30 so it had ended. Treated myself to Manhattan Pizzeria and once again I was bowled away by a fantastic pizza...the Buffalo Chicken one. Would also recommend the Famous 2 deal at Red Apple the one with chicken cheese roll and chicken cheese burger. MUST try. Juicy moist yummy burger and that roll was just heaven on earth...every bite had cheese in it. And for 250 bucks it was too good to be true. Lastly, the Kaybees icecream is still great....and will take you on the nostalgic ride as the taste (along with the packaging, the perfect taste of ice cream with no after taste) is amazingly the same as it was years ago. Somethings SHOULD never change.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-17T22:52:32+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-17T22:52:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"866095436","name":"Eesha Nasir"},{"id":"590885474","name":"Latif Farooqi"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI5MzYxNzk3","before":"ODY2MDk1NDM2"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_558647054186449","from":{"name":"Shafiq Siddiq","id":"583273001"},"message":"Any idea about LAL\u0027s Hi-tea ???need suggestion","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-17T20:51:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-17T20:51:37+0000"},{"id":"165861103465048_558011074250047","from":{"name":"Mahrukh Murtaza","id":"545355244"},"message":"The Lantern is cooking up additions to its menu.Serving up soon!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-16T07:16:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-17T20:27:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE5MjM1ODcz","before":"NjE5MjM1ODcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"558069280910893","from":{"name":"Mohammed Rizwan","id":"1542669392"},"message":"Can\u0027t smell but nice artwork for sure.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-16T11:41:13+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"558629020854919","from":{"name":"Qais Sheikh","id":"100002010923914"},"message":"Where is it","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-17T19:42:12+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"558639100853911","from":{"name":"Mahrukh Murtaza","id":"545355244"},"message":"The Lantern is at 76 Clifton,on Old Clifton Road, next to The Lyceum School.Its in the same compound as Cafe 76.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-17T20:19:54+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"105928046242770","name":"The Lantern","type":"page","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"558639650853856","from":{"name":"Qais Sheikh","id":"100002010923914"},"message":"Thanks mahrukh u r really decent what is best there","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-17T20:21:58+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"558639934187161","from":{"name":"Mahrukh Murtaza","id":"545355244"},"message":"Their menu is up on their Facebook page.I would say all dishes are worth a try.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-17T20:23:13+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"558640877520400","from":{"name":"Qais Sheikh","id":"100002010923914"},"message":"Will go I own world catering event company in phase 2","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-17T20:27:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTU4NjQwODc3NTIwNDAw","before":"NTU4MDY5MjgwOTEwODkz"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_558640337520454","from":{"name":"Abid Ibrahim","id":"764689322"},"message":"Is there a new Chinese restaurant on shaheed e Millat road?
