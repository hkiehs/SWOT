Dolmen Mall has a huge atrium, vast open spaces for people to move about in. On the other hand, Dolmen Mall feels cramped and small-ish, which occurs as a disappointment considering the imposing building as you walk inside. Farid\u0027s is amazing, yes, but if you are looking for a complete shopping experience, Ocean Mall is quite small in terms of space. Another thing is the attitude of the workers there. I found the workers in Farid\u0027s to be completely different than those working in the mall above. Cineplex walay toh have an attitude problem, which is really sad considering the exorbitant prices that they are charging for a movie. Also, one thing that I feel the mall suffers from is the lack of innovation; same old stores, same old brands, same old shop interiors.
