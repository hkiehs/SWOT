First and foremost the decor, with winters arriving it really felt like i was at a ski resort type restaurant. very cozy and a homey feel.\nwe were two people and as soon as we sat we asked for Mr Najam Quddusi and he came from behind the counter with a welcoming smile.\ni had read a lot bout how interesting he is as a person and how everyone\u0027s always had a great conversation with him.\nso from the man himself we ordered a chicken burger (churger) and a big log cheese burger and whilst that was on i *snap* remembered spicy ladies! for a churger i was asked if i wanted a crisp batter fried fillet or grilled so i opted for grilled. \nwhilst we sat and talked about what we wanted mr NQ started telling us about the burger which was round the corner \u0027 burger from hell\u0027 what ingredients it would have, sounded bare spicy so we asked if we could jalepeno\u0027s in both of our order and yes that was fulfilled.\nso round one *ting ting* spicy ladies : the green chilies werent as spicy as we were earlier told by NQ but they did get me tears a run with that OH SO AMAZING chilli sauce, it was tangy and SPICY!loved it.\nround 2 *ting ting* came in these log in special shots (drink) chilled to the max and had coconut and strawberry notes to it and rest was a mystery. was good.\nnext came in our burgers. \ni had the chicken burger but looking over the table saw how huge big log is!! wow i was jealous!!\nWhat i loved bout mine was that there was \u0027honest chicken\u0027 in there. it was a stingy burger. that made me happy every bite had a good amount of chicken.\nfries were crisp well cooked.\nfor drinks i had water and my friend had a pina colada.\nwe were two well fed happy bunnies.\nafter we had paid by card my friend asked for a water bottle and wanted to pay by cash but NQ said not to worry bout it.\nlast but not the least a bit of after dinner discussion about Pakistan and what not which completed the log in lounge journey!\n:) \nP.S : can my churger be next time as huge as the big log with preferably a mince chicken patty ??

The service was very prompt, friendly and attentive. But in terms of food, it remained a few notches below the ambrosial feast that I was anticipating given the rave reviews here. \n\nOur spread included:\nCream of Chicken Soup.. Very rich and creamy. The kids loved it!\nPaneer Reshmi Handi.. Delicious, but a tad bit over-rated. Honestly speaking, it tasted just like pasta in white sauce sans the pasta! This was pointed out by my 7-year old, and after that I had a hard time eating it with naan. :/\nSeekh Kababs, Behari Chicken Boneless, and Malai Tikka.. all were good but I\u0027ve had better! Malai tikka was slightly undercooked. (Seriously!!)\nGarlic naans: the first two were dry and hard, the third one was soft and fluffy (since we had complained about the first batch) and then the fourth one was again like the first two.  \n\nAll food was delivered hot and fresh (barring the naans), and stayed so despite the open air seating. The floor manager was very interested in our feedback and we did point out the shortcomings. \n\nI wouldn\u0027t mind going to Kolachi again for its serene and magical surroundings. Perhaps I\u0027ll sample the non-desi entrées next time.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-22T20:47:16+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-23T05:34:13+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"463561057028383","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Saira Malik don\u0027t.
