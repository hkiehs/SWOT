A lil Pizza with four choices of toppings. They offer wedges or a couple of Garlic breads. Not the supreme ones. No cheese. So kinda meh. And a drink. \n\nIll cut to the chase. Whattay Pizza!! \n\nCheesy, loaded with thick gooey rich sauce and near perfect fluffy crust with that crunch on the outer bits. The toppings were jus okay and not so evenly spread, but that meant more bites of that rich tomato sauce hidden under that thick cheese.
