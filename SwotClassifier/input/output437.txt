I ordered some things from Urbanite yesterday and they sent me a sandwich from San-which? and some sorbet from Lal\u0027s free of cost. \n\nThe sorbet like always was great. But the sandwich was terrible. It was the beef brisket but had more fat(charbi) than beef in it. No wonder it was free? \n\nEven if it is - if you\u0027re trying to attract customers by letting them sample your food that does not mean you give them cheap quality beef. I was impressed by their initiative to market the product but the quality was just disgusting. \n\nNext time people should really think before sending absolutely inedible food to customers. Even If I was going to try this place out I probably won\u0027t now.\n\nI was just appalled and I hope they pay closer attention to the food they are serving next time.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-06-29T11:06:04+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-01T18:51:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1364876326","name":"Nausheen Siddiqui"},{"id":"100000107764417","name":"M Kashif Malik"},{"id":"508829952","name":"Ayesha Saeed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA4ODI5OTUy","before":"MTM2NDg3NjMyNg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"578136435570844","from":{"name":"Ayesha Saeed","id":"508829952"},"message":"I got the turkey smoked sandwich, i would give it a 8 out of 10.
