I was like I will go ahead and give it a try at dinner time.. \n\n What had changed was the way we were approached..

In case you\u0027re wondering, I did not just go to a restaurant in Karachi. So I can\u0027t really share my experience at one of these that are discussed here.\n\nBut what i will tell you is that I have lived in Karachi for most of my life (well, until I decided to go study engineering at NUST Islamabad). Even more than the lights and the life Karachi resonates with, what I miss the most is food... OUR Food. From the \"ami kay hath ki pakai hwe bhujya\" and Bun Kabab Stalls at Tariq Road to Kolachi at the rocks, every bite has had a special taste to it- one that is simply absent from the food that I eat here.\n\nPlease don\u0027t misunderstand me. Islamabad has some amazing restaurants. Chai khaana and Kitchen Cuisine, for instance, are worth a try. But the taste, the mix, the presentation and everything else is something we Karachiites can never settle for.\n\nEveryday, I stare down at food that lacks in spices, add-on veggies, and often in cooking too. After all, the hostel dining hall has to cater to students from all over the country. From what I have inferred, the spice intake generally decreases as you go \"up\" the country.\n\n The Haleem on Saturdays is nowhere near to the one you guys can eat at Burns Road. You would not believe that what I get on Thursdays is Biryani if you\u0027ve have had a plate at any of the dhabbas or even your own place. The Qorma here? Oh boy if only they would use Shaan Masalas for that.\n\nYou know, I have kind of given up on the restaurants here too (seriously, how can anyone manage to eat  Afghani Burger?) What I now look most forward to is the monthly courier parcel my mom sends me. Yesterday I opened December to find packets of shami kababs, home made spaghetti, and chicken wings ^__^\n\nKarachi is under fire. Karachi is at War. Karachi probably needs a batman . But trust me, you guys still get damn good food to eat. I lost like 6 kg in my first 3 months here. Still haven\u0027t managed to recover all of that.\n\nBe grateful for the food you eat;love Karachi for it.\n\nStay safe \u003c3","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-09T20:55:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-10T19:26:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"807153988","name":"Huma Hussan"},{"id":"698480213","name":"Faiza Shafiq"},{"id":"100002459812246","name":"Mumtaz Begum Tejani"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"537798684","name":"Abdul Basit Memon"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"697750147","name":"Mohammad Ismail Asif"},{"id":"672626621","name":"Asad Baig"},{"id":"753624574","name":"Shazmeen Raza"},{"id":"100001993284398","name":"Rumaisa Nasir"},{"id":"650649934","name":"Ashnaa F Khan"},{"id":"564445611","name":"Shahbaz Ali Shueb"},{"id":"100002861468579","name":"Javeria Talal"},{"id":"100006019808344","name":"Anum Ellahi"},{"id":"552958742","name":"Amir Arfeen"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"100001408655261","name":"Faizan Kamran"},{"id":"864385150","name":"Faiz Khalil Shaikh"},{"id":"513198695","name":"Madiha Shiekh"},{"id":"655137222","name":"Hufsa Rizwan"},{"id":"781150340","name":"Huma Baqir"},{"id":"100006538473120","name":"Ali Shujaat"},{"id":"649725153","name":"Ateeb Akber"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ5NzI1MTUz","before":"ODA3MTUzOTg4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_664275373623616/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNjQ5NzI1MTUz"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"664372816947205","from":{"name":"Faiz Rahila","id":"681048718"},"message":"Very well said Hassan.

So it was my best friend Bisma\u0027s birthday celebration today so my friends and I went on a \u0027eating spree\u0027 you could say today and thus, I will write the reviews for all the places we went to and the things we ate.\nThe first place was McDonald\u0027s :p amazing caramel shake! One large shake between 4 girls. Hehe. And fries are always good. Then we went to Dolmen ka Gloria Jeans. We ordered the Aussie cheese fries and a mixed berry chiller. Both were, in my friend\u0027s words, outstanding. The cheese fries at Gloria\u0027s are the best! \nNext, Golden Dragon. We ordered the lunch box deal for one with egg fried rice and Szechuan chicken, though I personally insisted on the dinner deal which has 2 drumsticks as well (for lunch, I might add) and even though they said it was not possible, Qamarunisa is such a sweetheart that we spoke to her and she made it happen. Love her for that because we got drumsticks (that i was desperate for cuz they are so yummy). So overall drumsticks, Szechuan, rice, everything was divine as usual. Lastly, Grub. From what I can tell, this place is highly underrated and has amazing food so I think it deserves a good review. We ordered Grub Mush burgers, one pepperoni pizza, and their chocolate cake. The burger was huge and yummy as usual. It was the first time for all of us in ordering the pizza. It was quite yummy, cheesy and filling. The cake was soft, moist and just the right amount of chocolately goodness. Overall, an excellent day :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-10T16:05:16+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-10T18:41:00+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002403038747","name":"Noor Jamil"},{"id":"100004798268639","name":"Suha Qasim Memon"},{"id":"100000046931487","name":"Rida Ahmed"},{"id":"100000030480095","name":"Mehak Fatima"},{"id":"1406568558","name":"Ayesha Rehman"},{"id":"100002532210597","name":"Sana Ahmed"},{"id":"1000064178","name":"Kifah Memon"},{"id":"1371113498","name":"Danyal Sopariwala"},{"id":"851800404","name":"Aamna Mansoor Badshah"},{"id":"540790569","name":"Safa Cochinwala"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"759420423","name":"Huzefa Marvi"},{"id":"512864890","name":"Scidra Usman"},{"id":"532368457","name":"Areesha Junejo"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"598492138","name":"Hamza Shaikh"},{"id":"523035550","name":"Afifa Ali"},{"id":"100001246692407","name":"Bakir Hussain"},{"id":"100002046384968","name":"Usman Daudpota"},{"id":"547960510","name":"Husnain Minawala"},{"id":"574808344","name":"Kiran Dada"},{"id":"100001791165202","name":"Asjad Nadeem"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"509315108","name":"Daniyal Qazi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5MzE1MTA4","before":"MTAwMDAyNDAzMDM4NzQ3"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_664653446919142/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNTA5MzE1MTA4"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"664656560252164","from":{"name":"Afnan Iftikhar","id":"604430259"},"message":"\"dear diary ...\"","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-10T16:13:24+0000","like_count":23,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664657286918758","from":{"name":"Akbar Chaudry","id":"549896211"},"message":"that is an exceptional escapade. do all of your best friends receive such treatment? if so, i would like to throw my hat into the ring","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-10T16:15:07+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664657350252085","from":{"name":"Talha Habib","id":"100001830205217"},"message":"Marvi Shah How in the world u manage to gulp down all this much  food in one day","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-10T16:15:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664657710252049","from":{"name":"Marvi Shah","id":"522705412"},"message":"Lol all shared everything and ate everything with time intervals beech beech main","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-10T16:16:17+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664657740252046","from":{"name":"Khurram A Khan","id":"566660881"},"message":"Happy b\u0027day Bisma \ncheerzz","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-10T16:16:21+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664658536918633","from":{"name":"Sundus Qasim","id":"1213637082"},"message":"What a cute review ^_^","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-10T16:19:01+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664658626918624","from":{"name":"Marvi Shah","id":"522705412"},"message":"Sundus Qasim Bisma Patel Sakina Qutub\nQamarunnisa Asim","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-10T16:19:28+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim","type":"user","offset":0,"length":12},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel","type":"user","offset":13,"length":11},{"id":"548242045","name":"Sakina Qutub","type":"user","offset":25,"length":12},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","type":"user","offset":38,"length":16}]},{"id":"664658996918587","from":{"name":"Kiran Dada","id":"574808344"},"message":"So does it mean u started off with lunch and finished with a perfect dinner :);)\nKidding!
