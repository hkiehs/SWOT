Generous beef patty (cooked med. rare), soft, juicy and succulent. Well seasoned.  Bun was fresh and the best part was that the salad inside the burger was fresh (rocket leaves being a welcome and interesting addition here). All in all a very satisfying meal. For a diff. tried their sweet potato french fries. Interesting, but contrasted a bit too much with the classic burger and fries taste. BTW, they have a a choice of fires, sweet potato fries or salad as an accompaniment  to the burger.\n\nOne of the best burgers I have had in a long time. Thanks Pantry, very satisfied, from wait staff, to service to food and very good general cleanliness and ambiance :-)\n\nJust as an aside, and hopefully a chance to improve, the reason I didnt enjoy my first vist was that we had ordered sandwiches and found the bread too thick cut, a bit stale and crumbly in texture plus the filling was not too generous).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-30T10:30:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-30T17:40:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"780381887","name":"Samar Husain"},{"id":"503116086","name":"Amina Tahir"},{"id":"1143951347","name":"Sabeen Rasool"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"1385439948","name":"Danesh F.Khambatta"},{"id":"696432032","name":"Samiullah Tariq"},{"id":"512577683","name":"Salik Sajid"},{"id":"738981577","name":"Sohail Maskatiya"},{"id":"100000696198876","name":"Zain Sheikh"},{"id":"100000085462282","name":"Darayus P.
