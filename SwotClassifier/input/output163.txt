This was served! \n\nVery thin small piece of salmon and small pieces of brown bread. After awhile, our next table ordered the same thing, it looked almost the same but they had rockets/salad with it, it did look more presentable I must say. Upon enquiring, the manager informed us at that time when we placed our orders they didn\u0027t have rockets/salad. But of course, they should have informed us about it when we were placing the orders. The other orders were ok, nothing much to talk about. \n\nNot going there again of course.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-10-01T10:17:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-02T15:52:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"735210388","name":"Sabeen Shahpur"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"517581738","name":"Armughan Ahmed Faruqi"},{"id":"713936053","name":"Ali Nadeem"},{"id":"100001052438308","name":"Ahmed Baweja"},{"id":"505055634","name":"Umme Ifrah Arif"},{"id":"521735682","name":"Aamir Shahnawaz"},{"id":"100000238497030","name":"Madiiha N Narrejo"},{"id":"647940246","name":"Maheen Khan Omair"},{"id":"668642026","name":"Talha Shahid"},{"id":"1062305825","name":"Warood Chaudhary"},{"id":"849390060","name":"Faisal Qamar"},{"id":"705413771","name":"Shayan Abbasy"},{"id":"826365572","name":"Talha Patel"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5NDIyOTQ0","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"626999570684530","from":{"name":"Usman Ul Haq","id":"1026991508"},"message":"and they charged the same amount to you for an incomplete menu?
