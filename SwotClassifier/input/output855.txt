Our reservation was for 2:15pm. 5 of us reached on time and ordered the starters and soups. 4 of us were so called detained (by their kids) and reached around 2:50pm. The manager made such a big hue and cry in an elevated voice that why people at our table had not turned up? I was so offended and wanted to leave that instant but my friends calmed me down and found it too inconvenient to change locations as the rest of my friends were on the way. I admit we were partially at fault but this kind of treatment for higher turnovers is unacceptable. People sit and smoke at tables, chat etc when they finish their meals. The whole idea is to enjoy the day/night out and NOT stuff our mouths and leave so the next lot can do the same. Oh and the food was nothing to write home about. The atmosphere was poor; it was too loud, waiters bumped into our chairs and the rude manager gave us the eyeball.\n\nSecond experience\nLiving in Khi we dont give up easy. So I was craving chinese and my hubby wanted to try out somewhere new than our usual. So I said ok lets give Ginsoy another chance; but lets order in this time. Luck has it, they messed up my order I paid for Crispy(rubber textured) Prawns and they crispy (rubber) delivered Fish. When I called them up to complain they dint make it easy for me. When I asked them to deliver my prawns they mentioned it atleast 5 times not to touch the fish and return it as if we couldnt be trusted!! The delivery guy asked us to show us both so he was sure that we were not wrong! And when he saw no tails on the fish he left. I wish I had just handed him both and told him to getlost. \n It was so humilliating and I am so pissed! And boy was I dissapointed with the doughy rubbery prawns they delivered. \nThis restaurant really needs to get their act together.\n\nNEVER AGAIN","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T17:49:10+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-15T17:45:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"611720320","name":"Quratulaien Tanveer"},{"id":"809891464","name":"Julie Haris"},{"id":"681575742","name":"Samreen Sistanwala"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"515193342","name":"Mesam Akhter"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"501356389","name":"Ammara Haque"},{"id":"507428445","name":"Yasir Khan"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA5ODQwOTE3MQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NjExNzIwMzIw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397403113644178","from":{"name":"Bisma Patel","id":"877870480"},"message":"My first and last experience at Ginsoy was not good, either.

Obviously if these shows are not scripted that\u0027s another feather in the hat.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-14T08:42:42+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-15T10:26:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"511528611","name":"Farnaz Akhtar"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"573859815","name":"Nighat Khan"},{"id":"502572519","name":"Shaheer Mehkari"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"524990051","name":"Ovais Zuberi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"630120015","name":"Salimah Shiraj-Abro"},{"id":"892195391","name":"Tehreem Fatima"},{"id":"698885102","name":"Aamir Ghaffar"},{"id":"695995995","name":"Sadia Rizwan Fawad"},{"id":"689771441","name":"Riffat Fawad Bukhari"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg5NzcxNDQx","before":"NTExNTI4NjEx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397721826945640","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"i am totally blown away by them - just goes to show what anyone can do when encouraged motivated and guided properly instead of shunned down.\n\nlove the little ones, so impressed by them all.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-14T08:44:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"397722043612285","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"And the Pear Perfection \u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-14T08:44:59+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"397722196945603","from":{"name":"Sarah J.K","id":"708025491"},"message":"I DIED last night watching the finale","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-14T08:45:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"397722213612268","from":{"name":"Sarah J.K","id":"708025491"},"message":"omg! jaccccck","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-14T08:45:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"397724496945373","from":{"name":"Komal S.
