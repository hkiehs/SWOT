There was cheer among the people as there were many, which normally on a weekday the area is somewhat deserted.\n\nWas surprised at the interior of the restaurant, very well done as each and every inch was well utilised. Typical japanese interior, medium sized tables, upright chairs. Dim lighting but bright enough to see the plates and the dark colored chopsticks. \n\nOutside, there were tables carved out of pure seesham and soft chairs, ideal for 3 on each side.\n\nFor starters, there was all kinds of sushi... The aroma was very much inviting but since am allergic to raw fish, had a hard time to control myself. Helped myself to pickled Ginger and Raddish. Both were simply awesome as I have never had them before in any Japanese restaurants before. Raddish was sweet in taste, with a hint of orange and lime. Loved it so much that I asked for a second serving which was promptly brought to the table.\n\nThen came huge jumbo prawns, thick juicy and covered in that special crispy batter. Couldn\u0027t resist them so had a couple. Prawns were followed by California Maki, Spicy Tekka Maki, Tori Teriyaki, Ebi Tempura, Tori Teriyaki, Oishi Gyununiku Steak, Ebi Tepenyaki. \n\nEach and every serving was prepared to perfection with exceptional taste and served by well behaved and experienced waiters who also could speak couple of Japanese greetings. It was good to hear and see that the management has gone out of their way to train their staff.\n\nOne thing was annoying though.. as a policy of Oishi Sushi, there are no plastic bottles or alluminium cans allowed to be served on the tables, hence the only water they had was Evian water in a well shaped glass bottle.\n\nA real treat of a fine dinner.. Highly recommended..","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-28T13:24:35+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-29T06:18:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"1025016220","name":"Nabila Khawaja"},{"id":"626746793","name":"Hamida Najeeb Haroon"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"850419690","name":"Nida Huq"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ1NjIwMTMz","before":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"285715041479653","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"I am being jealous as how many ppl invite u ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T13:39:17+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285716544812836","from":{"name":"Khalid Lakhani","id":"711077848"},"message":"You can invite me too...but it will have to be after coming Tuesday, till then quite busy....","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T13:43:21+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285735018144322","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"What did you have Khalid bhai :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T14:28:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285736224810868","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"SARA please dont ask for anything as for any answer, he may ask for invite ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T14:30:49+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285738491477308","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Naaa he won\u0027t..

Had a mixed experience. Wonderful atmosphere. For starters ordered the jalapeno cheese balls because i\u0027ve had that before and i loved it the first time around. Hot n Sour and Chicken Corn soup, both soups were excellent, could not have been any better, hot n sour was probably one of the best i\u0027ve had in a long time, no one makes it like that anymore. \nFor the main course it was Szechuan Chicken, which was good, not to sweet like other restaurants make it, the beef chilli dry was my personal favorite, nice and spicy and the beef was done well . American ChopSuey, i didn\u0027t have because i\u0027m not a noodle type person, but I was told that it was also delicioso. What really ruined it for us was the hot n spicy shrimp, the shrimps were spoiled, put the first shrimp in my mouth and you could smell that they had gone bad, Ruined the whole taste of everything else. The waiter did ask if we wanted it replaced but we were really put off by that time. All in all after reading such raving reviews about Charmain Mao, maybe my expectations were higher than they should have been.Or maybe it was karma getting me back for cheating on BOTS and having seafood elsewhere.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-28T18:46:13+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-28T18:46:13+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_285856928132131","from":{"name":"Jamsheer Avari","id":"14902996"},"message":"Went to Koel a few days back with a couple of friends at lunch time.  Sat outside in the patio as the weather was lovely.  Only problem there was the appearance of a few flies from time to time.  The food, however, was absolutely brilliant.  The tapenade and olive bruschetta and the artichoke and spinach dip were great appetisers.  For the main, I ate the grilled chicken w/creamy tarragon sauce while my friends had the black pepper prawns.  The chicken and prawns were both cooked perfectly...my only minor concern would be that the prawns were a little bit too peppery, but thats just a minor concern.  The mint/lemonade drink (forget the proper name) was refreshing and helped digest the food.  Overall, a fantastic meal...would definitely go back again.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-28T18:37:03+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-28T18:37:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA0MDkzOTk3","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_285616451489512","from":{"name":"Ahsan Khawaja","id":"524740437"},"message":"Even @ the days end BOT\u0027S Prawn Biryani tastes at its best.
