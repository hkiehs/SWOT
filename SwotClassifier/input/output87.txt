A lot has been said about Rowtisserie, and every iota of praise is well-deserved by the eatery.  Headed out to Rowtisserie for late dinner last night, and it was a delightful experience.  The place continuing to serve flavorful food, in a casual setting, with fair prices.\n\nThe menu has been immaculately curated, with each item having its own distinct flavor profile.  Definitely better than places which serve 400+ items -- all tasting the same.  I just wish they can expand the menu to include Gyros.\n\nOrdered the Beef Shawarma, and Flamed Grilled Full Chicken, with sides of Hummus and Mash \u0026 Gravy.  The chicken was cooked well, tender, and loaded with flavor.  Every square inch of the chicken was flavorful, with the taste further accentuated by the Row sauce.\n\nThe pita was fresh, and toasted to perfection -- complementing the flavor of chicken.  The flame grilled chicken is a class apart from all chicken entrees served in the city, and is just fantastic.  The place serves Coke at an optimal temperature -- chilly, not freezing cold, or lukewarm -- a practice that needs to be appreciated.\n\nOrdered the Apple Pie, and Chocolate Tart for dessert.  The Apple Pie had that perfect flaky pastry, with the filling having that right sweetness.  Rarely does an Apple Pie get better than this, in Karachi.  The Chocolate Tart was a treat, with a uniform base, and a clean flavor.   The desserts were on the expensive side, as I\u0027ve had better desserts, at lower (or equivalent) rates at places dotted along the Mediterranean.\n\nA fantastic flavorful experience.  Rowtisserie has certainly set a benchmark for casual dining, and remains one of my preferred places to eat out.  Cost per head was PKR900 (including everything), and it may reduce to PKR700 if binging on desserts was excluded.\n\nOverall Rating -- 9/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-16T15:44:57+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-17T16:48:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"649980502","name":"Bushra Waheed"},{"id":"1343979604","name":"Nasim Ahmad"},{"id":"521961347","name":"Rabeet Ahsan"},{"id":"844625322","name":"Goher Zaman"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"100002402711136","name":"Tazeen Hasan"},{"id":"501776623","name":"Shayan Shabbir Lakdawalla"},{"id":"653913361","name":"Ahmed I Mehanti"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"807020133","name":"Mehreen Ahmed"},{"id":"100003863463567","name":"Sadaf Saad"},{"id":"537798684","name":"Abdul Basit Memon"},{"id":"1692080114","name":"Muhammad Abbas"},{"id":"508578177","name":"Wafa Umer"},{"id":"524665437","name":"Saher Najam"},{"id":"673567501","name":"Haris Hassan"},{"id":"506031208","name":"Aiza Khawaja"},{"id":"730910580","name":"Maira Samir"},{"id":"691624807","name":"Abdul Samad Mohammad Anwer"},{"id":"1292953231","name":"Aakash Kumar"},{"id":"685505626","name":"Haider Ali Raza"},{"id":"100001252885971","name":"Marium Sultana"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMjUyODg1OTcx","before":"NjQ5OTgwNTAy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"651766778207809","from":{"name":"Haris Hassan","id":"673567501"},"message":"love this place!!

At PKR580+ for a combo deal, BTB is relatively more expensive, and inferior in quality to Burger Shack.  I would not even pay half the price for a lump of flavorless meat sandwiched between random condiments,in a crumbling bun.\n\nNot really a fan of \u0027Chicken Burgers\u0027 -- but a bite from a friend\u0027s burger was as dry as dust.  The only saving grace were the curly fries.  A not so flavorful experience, and would certainly be avoiding BTB in future.  There are many other places which serve better burgers, and BTB clearly doesn\u0027t make the cut.\n\nOverall rating -- 5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-14T23:41:11+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-17T13:56:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"1343979604","name":"Nasim Ahmad"},{"id":"517543633","name":"Ahmed Siddiqui"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"1400446512","name":"Mohammad Saya"},{"id":"689541666","name":"Hira Zuberi"},{"id":"792915494","name":"Ahmad Fayyaz Ali"},{"id":"1424317236","name":"Anwer Jamal Chandna"},{"id":"766095724","name":"Kashif Malim"},{"id":"100001352027155","name":"Mehnaz Naseem"},{"id":"844980537","name":"Alvina Mirza"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"776525430","name":"Khadija Tahir"},{"id":"1152261756","name":"Ramiza M.
