More so with the service than the food. I ordered the honey prawn chilli and the squid. The order arrived on time, however it all went downhill from there. The total bill was supposed to be 850, and I was billed 900. When I asked the delivery guy why the billed amount was different, he had no idea. So I called BOTS. Big mistake. When I explained the situation to the guy on the phone, he first told me that there was no order under my name. When I told him I ordered via urbanite he told me he didn\u0027t know anything about that. I told him that the delivery guy was at the door and I needed him to just let me know why I was billed more than I should have. He put me on hold for what seemed forever and then told me that he will forward my complain to the relative department and they will call me back in two minutes. When I told the delivery guy that they are going to call back, he almost laughed and said \"ma\u0027am aap chor dayn, yeh aapko ek ghaintay tuk aisay he kaheingay\". He was nice enough to take just the 850 that I was billed on urbanite (by the way, he didn\u0027t have change for a 1000). It\u0027s been almost an hour since I called them and the \"relative department\" still hasn\u0027t called back. It\u0027s not about the 50 rupees, it\u0027s about the crap service that I was provided. \n\nNow onto the food. Honey chili prawn. I\u0027m sorry but there wasn\u0027t even a hint of honey in that dish and it\u0027s like the chili was added to make up for the lack of honey and was wayyy too much. Luckily, I don\u0027t mind spicy food, so i didn\u0027t hate it. However I  think if you\u0027re going to put \"honey\" in a dish\u0027s name, you should at least add it! The squid. It was pretty good. Honestly, it\u0027s the only thing that kept me from totally regretting my decision to order. Just one suggestion, when you\u0027re packing them to be delivered, please drain them properly. There was a lot of excess watery liquid in the box, not very appealing to the eye. \n\nIm sure plenty of you have had a great experience with BOTS, I really wish I could say the same.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-22T11:42:14+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-24T13:52:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"100000247881730","name":"Sarfraz Ali Siddiki"},{"id":"1519922458","name":"Sana Sultan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTUxOTkyMjQ1OA\u003d\u003d","before":"NzgwOTAyNzg0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"384088408308982","from":{"name":"Irum Ali","id":"100000226398562"},"message":"oops..looks like they messed it up big time.
