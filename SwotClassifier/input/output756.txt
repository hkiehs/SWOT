Because after insisting on how we didnt want to go for a buffet, we actually ended up going to an all you can eat. Cafe 76 is one of my favorite places and after reading such good comments about their iftar i even booked a table there, but somehow my friend was in a mood for desi food. So we ended up going to bbq tonight. I think their iftari was fine. Not extra ordinary. And im used to them being spot on with every dish...hence i was even a bit disappointed. For instance, the bihari boti wasnt well done. And i also felt that having one buffet spread for the entire floor isnt a good idea. The place was packed with people and while getting our food we had to almost elbow our way through the crazy line. One nice thing was that we went without any reservation and their manager was super nice to us and managed to get us a table. There were many people standing, waiting for a table to get arranged in that crowded place, but i guess we were extremely lucky to get seated right away while all of them waited :P\nAll in all, not a bad experience..but honestly at one point i did wish i had talked my friend into going to cafe 76 instead.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-15T03:57:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDI0MzI0NzY3NjE4Njc5","before":"NDIzNjQ1NzUxMDE5OTE0"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_424298034288019","from":{"name":"Sairah Khalid","id":"544715226"},"type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-15T02:20:11+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-15T02:20:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"617715399","name":"Uzma Javeri"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"711699788","name":"Sanaa Zubairi"},{"id":"636734568","name":"Aly Abbas"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjM2NzM0NTY4","before":"NjE3NzE1Mzk5"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_423888120995677","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"Craving endless exotic Thai food, Wondering if Fuchsia is offering a buffet at iftar?
