We had ordered the Iftar deal from them in the past and were not impressed; however after reading such raving reviews, we thought it was only fair to give the place another chance. The first thing we noticed was how the waiters cleaned the table next to ours and threw all the empty plastic disposable bottles on the street - where does that happen?? He then brought out a bucket of dirty water and drained that too while we just sat there witnessing this. We usually love street food and do understand that sometime hygiene is compromised on, but then to witness this was a bit much! SARA wasn’t there, as his daughter is unwell, so ordered from a few suggestions that I had read about on previous posts.  At 10.15 pm the prawn biryani had finished. We ordered calamari, both in farangi masala and the desi masala, leather jacket fish, again both in farangi masala and desi, prawn karai, prawn chili dry, and the chicken biryani. Farangi calamari was very good, however the desi masala was too much, very salty and very spicy. Leather jacket fish was almost rubbery, did not taste like fresh fish, and so did not like both farangi/desi. Prawn Karai was good. Prawn chili dry was also good, however would have been better, if the spice was a tad low and the dish served hot, instead of the luke warm that it was. Finally the chicken biryani, rice was of a low quality, almost like the “uncle ben” variety we get abroad, commonly called the “sela” variety here, and very average, not comparable to any other biryani places around. To say the very least we were extremely disappointed, and couldn’t quite understand the hype.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-23T07:08:06+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-25T19:05:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"708085760","name":"Cynara Siddiqui"},{"id":"850419690","name":"Nida Huq"},{"id":"577571775","name":"Nazia Hasan"},{"id":"100000578236531","name":"Naheed Asim"},{"id":"1665732464","name":"Sajid Dadabhoy"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"515102478","name":"Afreen Shiraz"},{"id":"687442041","name":"Nazish Faisal"},{"id":"100000759794024","name":"Ahmed Shahnawaz"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5NDIyOTQ0","before":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"301808203203670","from":{"name":"Mona Mahmood","id":"582426926"},"message":"I have to 2nd that.... all hype and hoopla n not too much taste or quality to back it up :-p the squid (plain) was the only redeeming dish while the prawn dry can be salvaged on a better day but there is better seafood out there... if u want street food then the fish/ prawn guy on Jamshed Road (been around for eons) is superb - n if u wanna slightly upmarket - Casbah at Beach Luxury makes the meanest Prawn Karahi (not on menu n apart from all the other yummy BarB seafood)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-23T07:22:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"301810359870121","from":{"name":"Yousuf Ali Sayeed","id":"672460650"},"message":"I agree with your assessment.

What I loved about it was that my dad, who had placed the order, got a call from the rider within 20 minutes that he was leaving to deliver the food, and would be there in 10 minutes, which he did. Second positive, the food arrived piping hot, with everything fresh! *Big grin*. We had ordered their club sandwich, chicken karhai, roast beef burger, and malai boti. The bread on the club sandwich was fresh and beautifully toasted, the vegetables were crunchy, and the best part is that there was just the perfect amount of sauce on the club, and everything from the chicken to the vegetables could be tasted. Next up was the malai boti. It was beautifully flavored, and literally melted in my mouth. The karhai was a bit too oily for my taste, which I guess is because I use very little oil in my homemade food. But was very flavorful, and despite the oil, I could taste the tomatoes and various spices from the karhai. The roast beef burger was honestly like a sloppy joe, but I loved it! The bun on the burger was fresh, the meaty bits wonderfully grilled, and the masala on it was yummy! I ate every single bite.
