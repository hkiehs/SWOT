Had been hearing mixed reviews so instead of focussing on the menu we ordered entirely based on recommendations from Ghazal Sajid and Ayesha Eirabie.\n\nStarted with the Mediterranean omelet which was perfectly cooked and had the perfect combination of egg, feta, olives etc. Followed this up with blueberry french toasts which were also delicious and hence didn\u0027t last long.\n\nNext came the burger trio, each of which had a slightly different flavour but were equally juice and literally melted in our mouths. For dessert the chocolate brownie had just the right taste and texture. A small negative was that they were out of vanilla ice cream to go with the chocolate brownie and the chocolate ice cream served instead seemed to have been in the freezer for way too long but was promptly replaced once we informed the server.\n\nAnd contrary to what I had been hearing about the place being too pricey, a bill of Rs 1800 for 2 people didn\u0027t seem outrageous at all for the quality of food and in comparison to similar eateries in the area. So overall I would highly recommend a visit and look forward to trying the rest of their menu soon!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-01T16:20:30+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-01T16:26:25+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"648616217","name":"Humayun Farooq"},{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQ0MjI3MTY4Mg\u003d\u003d","before":"NjQ4NjE2MjE3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"288202141230943","from":{"name":"Faisal Naseer","id":"780902784"},"message":"1800 for two persons?
