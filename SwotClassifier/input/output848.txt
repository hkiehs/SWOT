I had been craving the Philly cheese steak sandwich and a good pasta. Mr. Joe was kind enough to have it delivered with a generous, complimentary slice of Nutella cake. When it arrived, the food was as usual, piping hot. My mother had already eaten her lunch, but everything smelled so absolutely divine that she took several bites out of every single thing. I noted that this time the sandwich came in a baguette and not the usual panini, which held everything together splendidly. Before I could try out anything, Ami had tucked into the sandwich. Even she was impressed that the food was so garam garam. I was in the kitchen for only a minute getting the required forks and spoons, and when I came back, almost half of my sandwich had been eaten. I put it away for later before my mother could finish it off. We then tried out the Fettuccine Alfredo, and since it was my first time trying it out, all I can say is that I have been deprived. Wowza! Thick, creamy, deliciously flavored cheese on top (Parmigiano-Reggiano, I believe) with juicy morsels of grilled chicken and honest-to-goodness fettuccine! I was in pasta heaven, let me tell you. And although I was stuffed to the gills, I HAD to take a bite out of that Nutella cake. Hai. The sweetness, chocolatey goodness and melt-in-your-mouth texture sent me to another dimension of pleasure heretofore unknown to me. Half of everything is tucked away in my fridge for dinner.

I’ve been crazy busy with work the entire week.\n\nSo here is my list of top 10 eateries in Karachi :)\n\n1. The Upper Crust. Don’t think I need to go into the details here. Everything is sheer perfection. \n\n2. Koel Café – When in doubt, just land your tushie at Koel and you will always enjoy phenomenal food, lovely ambience and very courteous service \u003c3\n\n3. BOTS – again, no need to go into details, for obvious reasons, lol! Delicious food, great delivery service and an absolutely delightful host.\n\n4. Log Inn Lounge – serves one of the best burgers in town, service is fabulous and the host is a wonderful person. Which is an added bonus for the place that is already doing so well on its food :)\n\nThese are my top 4. Rest of the 6 are fabulous places but I’m only going to list them as I don’t really want to rate them on the top 10 in any particular order. They are all wonderful places that serve great food with impeccable service.\n\n• Olivetto – love the ambience, love the food even more.\n\n• Grilled Chilliz – delicious food and great value for money.\n\n• Snack Attack – a gem not known to many people on this group, in bahadurabad area. They make the best mushroom burgers in town! \n\n• Pizzo – reviving the concept of great pizzas delivered at home. After the great fiasco that pizza hut has been for many years and domino’s being a huge disappointment, pizzo is like a breath of fresh air.\n\n• Golden Dragon Chinese – don’t need to say much for them. I think this would be enough: I’ve never been a fan of Chinese food. But GD has totally won me over! \u003c3\n\n• Zahid Nihari, Tariq Road – deeeeliisshh!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-17T17:16:15+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-19T06:34:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100003034652779","name":"Saher Mukhtar"},{"id":"543405800","name":"Tahir Wahid"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"708482342","name":"Saba Basit"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzA4NDgyMzQy","before":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"399454210105735","from":{"name":"Bilal Alvi","id":"641495625"},"message":"a special mention for Gun Smoke.... the new one is better than the old one \u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T17:17:16+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399463893438100","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"have you tried gbc ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T17:39:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399464043438085","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"and saba do you have a facebook page ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T17:40:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399471693437320","from":{"name":"Mohammad Bin Zia","id":"1137915284"},"message":"Gauher Hashim Please check your inbox.

Anyhow I was so hungry by then I didn\u0027t much care. For appetizers we ordered the wontons which were excellent, the best of the bunch, couldn\u0027t stop eating them. The prawn balls were a bit too fishy tasting, and the prawn tempura had unfortunately gone soggy, probably because it had been in transit for too long. Other than that, the chicken red curry was spectacular, as was the beef with chilli and garlic. The beef in oyster sauce was a bit too corn floury for my liking, but okay on the whole. The only thing that was really lacking was the rice. Both the garlic and egg fried rice tasted the same, the garlic rice being something more akin to a yakhni pulao-ish type of thing. Serving sizes were great, though.
