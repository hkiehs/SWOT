Firstly, let me clarify and actually let you know the REAL reason we shut down on monday. We close on Monday so that our staff can have a day off since we do not have enough to cover for eachother. As soon as we hire more staff that can be trained (something which is not easy) we will keep it open 7 days a week.  Secondly, we have not taken reservations since over 2 weeks and are still not, due to various reasons previously mentioned on SWOT. No one in Xander\u0027s is allowed to take reservations and especially not permitted to send SMSs to our guests. I have inquired about this just now and have not found anything. Therefore, we don\u0027t blame this on \"teething issues\" and don\u0027t think that we were convering it up by making an excuse.

The Thai wok fried rice noodles were delicious but the stand out dish of the day was the Blackened beef with Hoison sauce...wow!! What an explosion of taste and texture. Dessert was the weakest part of the meal :(. A great addition to Karachi\u0027s dining scene. Service was attentive and polite. Great evening.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-11-29T18:32:36+0000","updated_time":"2011-11-30T13:43:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100000408234924","name":"Kamil Aziz Khan"},{"id":"1457119359","name":"Shazia Khan"},{"id":"1039048992","name":"Camilla Asmatullah"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAzOTA0ODk5Mg\u003d\u003d","before":"ODQ1NjIwMTMz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"268714066513084","from":{"name":"Camilla Asmatullah","id":"1039048992"},"message":"who owns it?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-11-29T18:37:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"268714923179665","from":{"name":"Naila Naqvi","id":"1481817950"},"message":"Not sure.
