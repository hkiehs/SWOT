I asked for ketchup on my table and the waiter went like \"Wahan jahan buffet hai wahan parhi tou hai.\" I was like there is no harm if i am asking for it on my table as i didnt spot it there. I got the same response when i asked for an extra fork while having food. Above all, the pamphlet on my table said it is rs 799 including tax and when the bill came they had charged extra tax saying madam we have changed the deal claiming that the pamphlet is old. Also, they had charged a good amount of Rs 300 as service charges (what kind of service are they providing when they cant get me ketchup or extra cutlery on my table.) The story doesnt end here, apparently they also charged for an extra lemonade whereas it was part of the deal and we didnt order any extra lemonade. Anyway the management apologized but the whole point is when you go out you want to have a good time not to deal with different sort of hassles.
