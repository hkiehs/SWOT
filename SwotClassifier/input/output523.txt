I must acknowledge that Hassan Baweja personally looked into the matter and had the courtesy to call up and make amends and assured that we wont have such an unpleasant experience... \n\nDecided to give them a second chance and I was pleasantly surprised...\n\nWent with a friend for lunch today around quarter past one.. After being welcomed and seated we were quick to place our order (prawn balls, prawn chilli dry and crispy Beijing beef) since we were really hungry as always... Unfortunately I could not even touch the beef due to an aggrevated medical condition...  \n\nThe starters were served within 7 minutes and the main course within 15-20 minutes ..Food has never been a complain and as always it was fresh and hot. Hungry we were so quickly finished the meal and during the meal the on-duty manager served us mint lemonade on the house which was fairly refreshing... \n\nSince we were running on the clock didnt have time for dessert. Got the bill at the right time this time round..loll... We were two satisfied customers and this time will definitely go back. Infact, I might be popping in with my friend who I went with last time fairly soon... \n\nOne piece of advice: Ensure that the quality of food is always consistent and the good service needs to be a regular feature as well.

Even though the delivery time took about 15 minutes longer than their promised 45 minutes (and each minute seemed like an eternity because we were famished), nonetheless, the food was great. Ordered the Juicy Beef Burger deal with fries  along with Spicy Fettucinni Alfredo with Garlic Bread. \n\nThe burger was absolutely delicious. Im not a big fan of beef burgers but this is definitely the kind of beef I would love to eat again; spicy, smoked, and just bursting with flavor! The burger was big and the serving of fries was also very generous.\n\nThe pasta I didn\u0027t like that much because it tasted too much of cream, plus the \"spicy\" element just didn\u0027t fit in with the taste of fettucinni alfredo we\u0027re generally used to. It wasn\u0027t bad either, my friends liked it so I guess all was good.\n\nVerdict: Gon Pacci has great food (with great prices to boot). Just a little work on their delivery service to make it a true winner. :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-04T16:07:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-04T19:50:29+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"519066927","name":"Maaheen Fahad"},{"id":"513139038","name":"Rabiya Shahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEzMTM5MDM4","before":"NTc1Mjc2NzUy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"553104121407409","from":{"name":"Kiran Afzal","id":"635810442"},"message":"The term \u0027deal\u0027 sounds interesting :D .. let me check them out .. \nand they delivered to your place? that\u0027s brilliant ..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-04T16:13:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"553111604739994","from":{"name":"Ambreen Ashraf","id":"675647072"},"message":"Sigh..I wish.
