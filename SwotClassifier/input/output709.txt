I went to verde yesterday and the ambiance was breathtaking.. the food was reasonably priced and the serving was also quite adequate. I ordered a cream of chicken and mushroom soup followed by a chicken jelapeno pizza. However, i was extremely disappointed by the service. the soup i ordered was served within 10 minutes of placing my order but as i was having it i found a stapler pin in my bowl and i immediately informed the waiter overlooking my table. All he did was appologise and said he would get it replaced and very conveniently said  the chef must have dropped it in by mistake! yet i decided not to make a fuss as this might deter other customers and i quietly had my soup. When it was time to pay the bill i noticed they had even charged me for the soup! as per my knowledge restaurants all across the world either donot charge or offer a complementary meal for such a blunder done by their staff but i was shocked to see that for a mere rs.200 the staff at verde was ready to lose their customer. Although the cafe is a good place to hang out the staff attitude was extremely disapointing.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-25T19:25:11+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-25T20:40:09+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"464704503580705","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Was the soup replaced?
