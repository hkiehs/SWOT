Be warned!\nAsked for an Upper Crust delivery tonight, and it reminded me of a visit or two I have made there in this past week. Those I will cover in detail later on in this post. The Philly cheese steak panini that I had ordered arrived hot, freshly made, in my requested brown bread, covered with fries (Bliss) and the coleslaw was in a separate container outside of the box where the sandwich and fries were. Those of you who have gotten warm, wilted coleslaw which has destroyed at least part of your sandwich will know the importance of crisp, fresh, cool coleslaw. So, I open up the box and move the fries away (It was like finding a surprise sandwich underneath), and lift up the sandwich. The cheese just drifted down the sides, along with the juices from the meat and caramelized onions in the sandwich. Now, that was food for the soul. Biting into it, I could only moan and groan with pleasure. My healthy eating-in option has definitely been discovered. The only disappointment of the day was that I was too late to sample those divine cookies everyone\u0027s been talking about *Pout*. But my waistline is grateful to all those people who ate those cookies and left none for me.\nAnother Upper Crust incidence was when I took a friend who was visiting from Islamabad to check out my new haunt. We tried out both the natural and hazelnut chocolate frozen yogurt, but I insisted that she try out the red velvet cake. I was told after the slice was duly devoured that it was the best red velvet she\u0027s ever had. Obviously. No surprise there.\nMy most favorite of all Upper Crust experiences however, is this final one. Taste-testing day! I happened to nip in around dinner time, and conveniently found out that the new menu was under production. Please don\u0027t think I\u0027m a glutton. I promise I didn\u0027t finish it all, just tasted enough to make a meal out of it. The Tex Mex Burger, served with a flaming hot chili sauce, Tex Mex fries, Swiss Mushroom burger (Correct me if I err), and Oreo cupcakes. Since I hadn\u0027t as yet tried out the pistachio cupcake or the all-berry margarita, those were sent my way, too. I have thankfully taken pictures of three of these items which I shall be putting up along with my thoughts on them. My favorite items from the menu, I scarfed down before realizing I hadn\u0027t taken any pictures. Oops. Now, the Tex Mex burger was a  chicken one (Apologies to all those people who don\u0027t like kukkur). I prefer my burger in beef as well, but let me tell you, the seasoning in that burger was spot on. Tangy, strong cayenne flavor, and a perfectly grilled chicken breast nestled between a perfectly toasted multi-grain bun. The sauce was the star of the show, however. Initially, it seems tangy, then a mellow, soft heat envelops your taste buds. It is DIVINE! I could drink that sauce (No joke). The Tex Mex fries were nice, too. If you frequent Upper Crust, you know nothing is over-powering, and there is always a balance of flavor. So, if you expect your Tex Mex fries to be covered in sour cream, meat and beans, jalapenos, etc. etc. skip it. This was a more refined version of masala fries. I shall now be continuing my UC rhapsody with the picture in a separate post.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-12T19:13:34+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-15T13:27:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"582742603","name":"Aamar Hassan"},{"id":"685000480","name":"Saman Jafri"},{"id":"501891633","name":"Komal Tauqeer"},{"id":"1454993708","name":"Tehniyat K.
