Brining is ineffective on a frozen turkey.\nUse 1 cup kosher salt per gallon (4 quarts) of water. If you must substitute table salt, use 1/2 to 3/4 cup per gallon of water.\nAdd herbs if desired. You could add a combination of 6 to 8 bay leaves, 1/2 cup dried rosemary, 3 cloves peeled garlic, 2 teaspoons peppercorns, and 1/2 cup dried thyme leaves. Try adding some brown sugar or 1 cup small dried red chili peppers if you want to add some heat.\nLength of brine time depends on the size of the turkey. As turkey gets larger, increase brine time rather than salt concentration.\nPlace turkey, breast down, in a large container made of food-grade plastic, stainless steel, or glass that will fit in the refrigerator. Add brine to cover. Keep cold in refrigerator while brining.\nRemove turkey from brine after recommended time and pat dry with paper towels. Not necessary to rinse.
