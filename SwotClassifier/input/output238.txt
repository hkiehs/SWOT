Repelled by the plethora of fast food joints in Dolmen Mall\u0027s food court, Noodle House seemed like a safe bet.  Liked how they take orders -- just tick items off the Order Pad, and you\u0027re done, an efficient method possibly pioneered by CHIPS in the city.\n\nThe service was quick, and smooth, with the meal being served within 15 minutes.  Placed an order for Wasabi Prawns for starters, followed by Chicken Pad Thai, Wok fried honey and sesame chicken, and Wok fried noodles as a side.\n\nWasabi Prawns had that perfect batter, with just a little bit of crunch, which was not overpowering the flavor of the prawns.  A bit of sweetness, and a bit of spice -- but couldn\u0027t really get that Wasabi kick, there was probably too much of lemon.  At PKR720 for 4 pieces, the starter was certainly pricey, and the flavor didn\u0027t really justify the premium price.\n\nChicken Pad Thai just had the right level of spice, and flavor -- and was probably the best entree of the evening.  Cooked perfectly, it had the right spiciness to it.  I couldn\u0027t really figure out what was \u0027Wok fried\u0027 about honey and sesame chicken -- seemed more like sesame chicken dipped in honey.  I could only taste honey, and nothing else.  And finally, the noodles weren\u0027t Wok fried as well -- they were probably just boiled.\n\nThe soft drinks were priced at PKR160 each (before tax), which is definitely excessive.  At the same price (or slightly higher) one can probably order Japanese Sake rather than a carbonated beverage, while dining East of Suez.\n\nTotal bill was PKR3800 (incl. taxes \u0026 tips) at a per head cost of PKR1268.\n\nAll items ordered had their own distinct flavor, and this is something that needs to be appreciated.   The price points are high, and in-line with European prices, particularly for casual dining.  At the end of the day, its just Pad Thai and Wok Fried Noodles! European prices in Karachi, while purchasing power is poles apart doesn\u0027t really make sense.  \n\nWith Pad Thai, Wok Fried Noodles, and other related items, gaining traction in the local market -- prices (in the market) might just will eventually converge to a more affordable range.\n\nA fairly expensive, and flavorful experience.  Recommended for the flavors.\n\nOverall Rating -- 7/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-31T23:15:18+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-31T23:15:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1652751344","name":"Rameen Alvi"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"600140056","name":"Rabbiya Abdullah"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.
