He said we will make the temporary reservation but booking will be confirmed once Rs. 3,000 has been paid in advance. I was like fine I will make the payment next week. Today I went to make the payment via my card but they said reservation is to be made by cash payment only and also informed me that only cash payments will be accepted on the day of the dinner. I was like this should have been communicated to me via phone when I was making the reservation or it should be mentioned somewhere (where ever you advertise your deals like karachisnob.com). Eventually I just decided to leave!\nCorrect me if I am wrong but wasn\u0027t Flo being cheap? I understand they were trying to get their confirmations by receiving advances from the customers but then at least mode of payment should have been kept flexible! Who carries cash in this day and age! They should bring it to the customer’s knowledge at least. I have always had a great experience at Flo but this incident left me utterly disappointed. Lesson to all the restaurant owners: PLEASE MAKE ALL SORT OF COMMUNICATION TO THE CUSTOMERS (BE IT RELATED TO DEALS, PAYMENT ETC.) VERY CRISP AND CLEAR.

The place has a great ambiance outside with a beautiful garden, however it was too cold so in we went. The interior isn\u0027t bad either, they\u0027ve really worked on making it feel like Thailand with busts of Buddha, even the music was thai pop.\n We went for a chicken salad for starters, i think it was called the Yum Gai, really fresh and perfectly seasoned with the chili well balance with lime and salt. \nNext came the mains, Tamarind Fish, Thai Green Curry and Jasmine Steamed rice. Again, the flavors were really well balanced and the fish was cooked to perfection, crispy but not hard on the outside and yet not overcooked. The green curry was thicker then we\u0027re used to but the flavors were great!\nMy wife is a Thai food aficionado and she couldn\u0027t get enough, mind you we had lahori sized servings!!\nThe service was quick and efficient, how much of it was down to the low weeknight traffic  cannot be determined. The only downer was the loud music, which was not needed as there weren\u0027t many customers. A great place for Thai food, probably better than the popular Karachi joints.\nNezihe Hussain","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-11T18:27:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-11T18:49:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"},{"id":"514605350","name":"Ruquia Jawed-Hammad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE0NjA1MzUw","before":"MTAwMDAwMjQ1MDc0MTk1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"504224602962028","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Hammad Umer - thank you for being such a sporty SWOTTIE.\n\ni love reviews like this where all ends well","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-11T18:49:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"622355253","name":"Hammad Umer","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA0MjI0NjAyOTYyMDI4","before":"NTA0MjI0NjAyOTYyMDI4"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_504210739630081","from":{"name":"Zara Dhanani","id":"737180575"},"message":"Taking Valentine\u0027s day orders until tomorrow, February 12th for the following, Red Velvet cupcakes will be available to pick on the 14th at a 2 hour notice. \n\nValentine\u0027s decorated:\nCakes (butter cream filled and frosted, rainbow, twin cake etc.)\nS\u0027more Brownie Pie\nRed Chocolate topped Eclairs\nCaramel Squares\nLemon Bars\nLemon or Nutella Tarts\nBoston Cream Pie\nCroquembouche (profiterole tower)\nRed Velvet or coloured Vanilla Cupcake Caterpillar\n\nLet\u0027s spread the love with Comfort Food!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-11T18:09:18+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-11T18:09:18+0000"},{"id":"165861103465048_504192709631884","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Taha - once again spectacular brownies.
