I looked over and saw a cozy corner at the back which was empty and asked him if we can sit there. My mother is more comfortable with cozy corners. Before he could reply, the manager from nowhere stormed upon us and said,”Nahi nahi, wahan koi nahi beeth sakta. Who jaga band hai. Jo table de hai us main he bethain.” He said it in a pretty loud voice, with rudeness in his tone and his face expressions which were seriously annoying and if I may say disgusted. \nI doubt if I will be going to gunsmoke again after this horrible experience. \n\nI told the whole story to my husband who was furious and said that I should have said something to the manager.
