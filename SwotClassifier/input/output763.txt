So good choice for using that service for delivery De Joe. The order was a couple of minutes late but excusable. Suggestion: Please improve the packaging to ensure that things dont get spoilt. The red velvet cake was all over the box because in that box, at least 20 of those pieces could fit whereas there were only 4 so this was bound to happen. The box for the burgers and the fries were perfect.\n\nThe good things about the deal: \n\nThe char broiled burgers are divine. My brother said that they tasted like mini bite-versions of a burger he had at Hardees. He did mean it as a compliment. There was nothing special about the Masala/Spicy fries. The Tex-Mex fries were yummy. The red velvet cake was the best RVC me and my family has had till date. Either the base is not moist, the frosting is too sweet, the base has an eggy smell or the frosting does not do justice to the base. But this RVC is a winner in all aspects. It is even better than Pane and Amore which was so far my fav place for RVC cupcakes. The Nutella cake is par brilliance. There is a thin layer of hazelnuts or walnuts which go crunch crunch in your mouth after mini-intervals. It is so delicious I wanted to cry out loud. \n\nThe bad things about the deal: \n\nThe fact that it is not a 4 person deal, or even a 3 or 2 person deal. \n\nSuggestion: \n\nPrice the deal at 500 bucks, replace the 1.5 litre with a 500 ml one and rename it as UC Iftar Deal. Another suggestion would be to let things the way they are and just increase the size of the cake. It is not actually a cake platter because I have never seen such tiny pieces of cake even in places that have a buffet-style dessert like Al-Bustan.\n\nOnly me and my brother were full. Mom and sister had to have pakoras and yesterday\u0027s leftovers coz it was too late to make anything. I told them that 2 deals would be enough for the 4 of us...and it wasn\u0027t. Having said that, at least for me and my brother, the experience was outstanding. And my mom and sister also agreed that  everything was yummy...if only the quantities were great.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-11T16:09:19+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-12T12:01:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTg0NjgyMjQz","before":"NjI1OTY4OTUz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"423139494403873","from":{"name":"Sameer Beg","id":"583446948"},"message":"ouch","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-11T16:33:37+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423321851052304","from":{"name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary","id":"100000093496883"},"message":"No, Muneeza Kidwai","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T05:48:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423393174378505","from":{"name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary","id":"100000093496883"},"message":"Pleasure..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T12:01:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDIzMzkzMTc0Mzc4NTA1","before":"NDIzMTM5NDk0NDAzODcz"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_423087394409083","from":{"name":"Hassan Khan","id":"535065551"},"message":"Quick Question .... \n\nIs it \u0027morally\u0027 ok for a food blogger to sell food?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-11T13:07:14+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-12T11:59:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"585858177","name":"Adeel Waqar Ali"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjUwODQ1MDAz","before":"NTg1ODU4MTc3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"423094911074998","from":{"name":"Muneer Esmail","id":"1110752792"},"message":"Begs the questions - Is it morally OK for the entire government to disobey the supreme court?

Im assuming given the fortnight of shutdown everyone did want to try it out, plus a Saturday night and lets admit it, it is a place more often than not we all do enjoy a lot. \n\nTranslation: a 20 minute wait told upfront. It was made comfortable thanks to the lovely cane sofas outside Ensemble which was well complemented by pleasant breezy weather. Courteous and apologetic at the same time for the wait, really made the difference.\n\nWaiters attended well to orders and there was no wait. The entrepreneur was actually watching everything when not going to and fro checking on all tables. We didnt realise our food was taking time. We were reminded by his presence. Honestly i guess the world must be complaining so much because every table and every waiting guest was being checked on. \n\n Food: burgers am told were lovely. I tried them once before: they were good so am sure these were great as well. to quote one of our: \"best burger!\" . I gladly savoured the fries and iceberg+arugula they opted to ditch. \nPrawn on toast: among the place\u0027 star items on the menu and surely didnt fail to deliver again. \n\nChicken satay: i love their satay usually. i may have loved it today but erm the peanut butter was not offfset but sufficient fish sauce/ salt. though have to appreciate how very creamy it was and how succulent the chicken pieces were. plus the garlic rice: lovely. not overpowering at all. ample chilli flakes but not at all spicy. \nI did send the satay back for redoing with fish sauce cuz it was too sweet but it didnt come back to my liking. honestly: i cannot complain. The place has always served good food so once, with all the rush outside, it was alright. It also is a possibility they changed the recipe to make it a bit sweet and creamier and not salty. I cannot complain. but i honestly couldnt eat it. so brought it back home to be fixed at home. \n\nCaramel frappe was a delight as always. mildly sweet with the flavour of caramel and so creamy. followed by red velvet cupcakes: mmmmmmm.\n\nthe place is always such a pleasant experience. have always loved their food and decor but the attention today and the efficiency by the staff despite all the rush added to yet another good evening.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-11T20:42:32+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-12T10:36:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"423319967719159","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"forgot to mention the other aspect of Xander\u0027s which also left a mark: beef patties and prawns on the bread were all well covering the bread, instead of the gaps. you get a good whole fill of what your ordered. so much attention to detail.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T05:37:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423376751046814","from":{"name":"Fahad Humayun","id":"756755028"},"message":"I had an awful first experience there and I had decided not to go there again...but now maybe I will :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T10:32:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423377937713362","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"have read of a lot of bad experiences at Xander\u0027s  on SWOT and honestly AlHamdOLillah we\u0027ve never had one. \n\nmore importantly each time having observed Alexander stand and monitor everything and keep checks on everything, it got a bit difficult for me, personally, to believe things could have been so bad for people without having a solution to a problem. \n\ni do suggest you go. hopefully you wont have a bad experience but in case you do, do tell them team or Alexander himself if he\u0027s there. things are attended to: again: from observation of each visit we\u0027ve made there","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T10:36:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDIzMzc3OTM3NzEzMzYy","before":"NDIzMzE5OTY3NzE5MTU5"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_423257991058690","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi Thank you!!!
