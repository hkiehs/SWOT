Had tried it once last year and that was out of the world but what I Received YESTERDAY was NOT upto the standard! I really didn\u0027t want to complain,but since I spent so much,didn\u0027t really feel good. The Chicken Chowmein was very dry and was tasteless (not juicy like before) the fried rice were not warm at all,seemed stale..it seemed that they were directly delivered from the fridge..without heating up..Manchurian was alright but too spicy..it didn\u0027t look as if it was GD...the quantity was enough to serve the 4 of us..but I was not really satisfied.
