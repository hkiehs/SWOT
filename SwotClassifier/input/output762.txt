Food was really good, i wont go ooohh and aaah in praise cuz i didnt get to try the complete menu, which is what i was hoping for. But the iftar was outstanding. Everything including the pakoras, tempura, wontons was spot on. Beef in peppercorn sauce was my personal favorite, along with the chicken and beef skewers. \nService was extremely good aswell. I was a little dissaponted with the desserts because i have a heavy sweet tooth and nothing fullfilled it. The cakes slices/brownies were too dry, the pudding was decent but nearly not sweet enough, but i guess thats what happens when youre catering to everyone in a buffet. \nWhat left a really bad taste in my mouth was the incident that took place outside while parking, when i got into a spat with tullay guards of an exiled leader of a certain ethnic party. Thankgod for one of them being cool headed and  intervening otherwise things couldve gotten worse. Aman was apologetic but it obviously had nothing to do with them.

I personally loved, loved, loved it! My dad however, is old school with the same old Pizza Hut craving. Sigh. First of all, the way everything arrived. Piping hot, within thirty minutes, and smelling delicious! The sauce the chicken wings came in were spot on, and reminded me quite a bit of Upper Crust\u0027s Tex-mex sauce. Believe me, that\u0027s NOT a bad thing. Two places which make my kinda sauce? Yes, please! My sister devoured at least 4 of the 6 which I\u0027d ordered. Moving on to the pizza itself. I requested the red jalapenos along with the onions and green chili topping, and it was the red jalapeno which made the pizza come alive. Personally, I would have preferred more marinara sauce on the base, since the flavor of the sauce itself wasn\u0027t coming through. Other than that, it was light, definitely thin crust and a joy to eat. The cinnabread was nice too, and I really enjoyed the crunchy demerara, cinnamony topping. I just wish the bread itself hadn\u0027t been just plain bread. A bit of the topping infused with the bread itself will definitely make me come back to it again and again. Overall though, it was a brilliant experience, and I\u0027ll definitely be ordering from Pizzo again!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-12T18:08:31+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-12T18:40:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"544811222","name":"Tehniat Aftab"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"558530146","name":"Fariha Nadir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTU4NTMwMTQ2","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"423500274367795","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Hallelujah!

If you do a careful review, not all, I would go so far as to say most home based caterers/bakers are NOT overpriced. Their per/lb. prices for standard cake flovours like chocolate fudge are either at par with the boutique bakeries, or less. Most home bakers are using better ingredients and since they are not producing in bulk, what you get is absolutely baked fresh. Also they may not be getting the advantage of wholesale prices, so their costs may be a little higher because of that. I know the chocolate that is used in some of the boutique bakeries of yesteryears, and what I use. There is a difference in it. I also know the amount of filling I use, and what they use. Not talking of the new lot of boutique bakeries, I think they are using better ingredients and are more quality and design conscious. And like Uzma Saeed says, for cakes with design, you are paying for the design, not the basic per/lb cake. And that is any artists due. Good home based bakers of the past like Armeen, were also more expensive than the market, so the trend has not changed. I sell Khow Suey for Rs.350 per serving that is good enough for two. Restaurants will serve you a little less than half my serving for the same price or more, because of their overheads. I am giving the client the benefit of my lower overheads!
