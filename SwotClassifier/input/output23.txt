Prompt on time serving, extremely courteous waiters and to my surprise they were trained in english. The service made my day.  \n\nOk secondly a big WOW to the person who created the ambiance of that place. It looked and felt spectacular.\nAll red and really cozy. The upper decks had an even better feel.\nI award it the best looking restaurant at do darya *if there is such an award*\n\nI bounced around on all three decks and 3 different spots after finally deciding to settle down on the very first one :p. *salutes their level of patience*\n\nOk now food..\nOrdered chicken corn soup for starters, chicken fried rice, chicken manchurian and chicken chilli noodles.\n\nSoups:\nThick creamy with lots of corn that is exactly how i like my soup and that is exactly what i got.  So thumbs up.\n\nChicken Manchurian:\nI am the self proclaimed queen of manchurian lol and after searching through half the city i have finally found my manchurian spot !! It tasted spot on. Had the perfect hit of tanginess and the sweet and sour ka combo. One spoonful and i was dancing with the fishes. *moment of pure joyy*\n\nChicken Chilli Noodles:\nI just had a taste of them since im not a noodle person but my friend who is a freak o noodle enjoyed them enough to chow down the whole bowl. *they gotta be good*\n\nFried Rice:\n10/10 \n\nOverall:\nWith the total being around 2k with drinks i give it a yes for value for money.\nLoved the food and i learned its only their soft launch ka phase. Thumbs up to the service i very rarely get impressed by service.\nTaste 10/10\nAmbiance 11/10\nService 11/10","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-25T21:36:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-28T08:05:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"651643760","name":"Jasrah Mubarak"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100003048580286","name":"Nayyera Saeed"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"100003324650990","name":"Imran Chef"},{"id":"100006791794583","name":"Shaiful M Wala"},{"id":"655635427","name":"Joanna Cash"},{"id":"100001052705593","name":"Shan Baloch"},{"id":"100001577208784","name":"Shahzad Shahab"},{"id":"100000556308750","name":"Laraib Malik"},{"id":"1057693917","name":"Hira Abbasi"},{"id":"100001404799008","name":"Muhammad Hussain Khan"},{"id":"581135723","name":"Faizan Rasheed"},{"id":"1304434596","name":"Syeda Jabeen Jahanzeb"},{"id":"829254501","name":"Kamran Anwer"},{"id":"100003436701094","name":"Rayan Raza"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"796000540","name":"Nisa Abdul Basit Khan"},{"id":"867800502","name":"Hira Saiyed"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"100003156069393","name":"Shajia Sajjad"},{"id":"100003570224157","name":"Kashif Khan"},{"id":"100003361185490","name":"Iram Faisal"},{"id":"613251390","name":"Asma A.

Comfortable large space, with two storeys (one one is functional for now)\n\nCourteous staff and an attentive chef who came and helped us select our dishes.\n\nThe prawn crackers were fresh and crispy and the three dipping sauces on the table were just divine. \n\nThe two soups ordered were the HOT \u0026 SOUR and EIGHT TREASURES. Both were excellent, proper flavourful stock and full of different veggies and mushrooms. I don\u0027t think either one had any seafood in it so good for everyone on the table. By the way HUGE servings. One large bowl was good for 6-8 people. And 4 people if they just go for soup. Which I can see my self doing.\n\nThe starters were WASABI PRAWNS, DYNAMITE PRAWNS and CHINESE DRUMSTICKS. Both the prawns were well fried in nice batter. Sauce tasted different and were very nice. For me wasabi can have more of a kick. But great for everyone. The dynamite prawns too could have been spicier but that\u0027s an individual palate.\n\nMain course.....HUNAN BEEF, BLACK BEAN SAUCE BEEF, KUNG PAO CHICKEN, FISH IN APPLE SALSA. THE CARBOHYDRATES......CHICKEN CHOWMEIN, CHICKEN FRIED RICE\n\nEach tasted different, was presented well, had distinct flavour. As Luciferz Angel pointed out - the food was neither desiofied nor was it authentic, it was a very well balanced happy medium. Something one can keep going back for again and again.\n\nI am looking forward to my next trip especially for the whole red snapper and to try out the lemon chilie soup.\n\nSince no meal is complete without dessert. We all hopped and skipped (ok drove) to HOTSPOT and had the yummiest ice cream and apple crumble.\n\nAll in all a great meal and a lovely evening with good friends\n\nPS Faisal Naseer will post the food pics.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-27T18:43:04+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-27T21:54:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002364449168","name":"Mansoor Hussain"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"7923343","name":"Usman Moon"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"100006770439612","name":"Rehan Ateq"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzkyNDcwMTcw","before":"MTAwMDAyMzY0NDQ5MTY4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"673327156051771","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Any Prawn Tempura swotties?
