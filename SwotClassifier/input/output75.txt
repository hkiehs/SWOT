We were 7 including 2 kids. Safe to say that was starvng and therefore ordered maybe too many starters and subsequently not enough main course but then there is always next time :). \n\nFor starters we ordered Prawn balls, Ginsoy Wraps and Chicken Drum Sticks along with the Thai Soup (the supersize portion they call large) and one order of sweet and sour (white). \n\nLets start with the soup... When a 5 year old drinks a soup and says Yummm... that says enough. One of the best I have had in a long time. The thai was so good that the sweet and sour infact got packed and taken home :).\n\nOf the starters the Wrap was excellent and I wish we had ordered more. The prawn balls were ok and the Chicken wings were also good. Again, if you go there and haven\u0027t tried I would recommend the Wraps.\n\nOnto the main course. The Cherry Chilli Chicken and the Spicy Garlic Chicken. I preferred the Cherry Chilli but overall great food. \n\nLet me add that the service was excellent and the staff very friendly... our server was Marison who did an excellent job. \n\nAll in all, a positive experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-27T08:18:01+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-27T10:45:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"502191902","name":"Zaigham Hidayatullah"},{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"638521516","name":"Abdul Ghaffar AG"},{"id":"511168242","name":"Akber Ali Khaliqdina"},{"id":"651674702","name":"Mohsin Baweja"},{"id":"885940595","name":"Ranjenah Bariya"},{"id":"586401160","name":"Ali Sheikh"},{"id":"505056779","name":"Adeel Humayun"},{"id":"1275940201","name":"Noman"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"688747484","name":"Uzair A Kaleem"},{"id":"732459812","name":"Asif Aslam"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"708482342","name":"Saba Basit"},{"id":"515208057","name":"Faizy Farooq"},{"id":"621305514","name":"Aniqa Imran"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjIxMzA1NTE0","before":"NzA1NTMzOTI0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"657927627591724","from":{"name":"Faizy Farooq","id":"515208057"},"message":"i can go to ginsoy again and again and again and again...................... and again.. and still not get bored of the awesome food it has to offer :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:34:56+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"657929180924902","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Great review Shujaat Alavi :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:40:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"853165219","name":"Shujaat Alavi","type":"user","offset":13,"length":13}]},{"id":"657932784257875","from":{"name":"Asim Ibrahim","id":"100004366567543"},"message":"location plz.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:54:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"657964200921400","from":{"name":"Saira Danish Ahmed","id":"1116196206"},"message":"I have been to both Ginsoy main and Ginsoy extension.

I absolutely love intricate work especially when it comes to cake decorations and these did not disappoint, as a matter of fact they exceeded the expectations I already had. You can see the effort put in both the cake and the cupcakes ...it is an exact replica of the sample pictures we sent for the design. The cake and cupcakes were the highlight of the day! :) Amna was very cooperative and sweet which is very important, made the whole experience worthwhile and the cake/cupcakes their moneys worth.

We were warned that the mushroom Swiss would be a small burger but given the size of the same abroad, I didn\u0027t pay much attention to that. \n\nThen arrived the tiny mushroom Swiss burger, I looked here and there to see hidden cameras and that probably I was on some comedy reality show being pranked and expecting Ashton Kutcher to come out. Nothing like that happened, and the wife starting eating the little meal one would serve to their bird.\n\nThe fries were fake as pointed out by many others. I dunno why people are not mad enough with BK at this point. A rough example would be going out to buy a sony tv, instead to find out everything about the tv is fake apart from the logo.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-25T17:21:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-26T19:02:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"557216100","name":"Vikki Mohsin"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"},{"id":"571951019","name":"Muhammad Ahmad Azfar"},{"id":"738981577","name":"Sohail Maskatiya"},{"id":"100000051507822","name":"Ammara Jaliawala"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"698785321","name":"Yusra Beyg"},{"id":"667185780","name":"Tahir Karimi"},{"id":"525410423","name":"Hassan Sheikh"},{"id":"189100160","name":"Ehtesham Maqbool"},{"id":"514964356","name":"Muffadal Dalal"},{"id":"517263328","name":"Kiran Shahnawaz"},{"id":"753624574","name":"Shazmeen Raza"},{"id":"724095104","name":"Ibrahim M Khalil"},{"id":"513274653","name":"Amna Hussain"},{"id":"731239419","name":"Asim Shakil Elias"},{"id":"692390995","name":"Wahaj M Khan"},{"id":"849920390","name":"Umer Rashid"},{"id":"600549988","name":"Sana Fahd"},{"id":"100001759346755","name":"Mustafa Mustie"},{"id":"538934895","name":"Amad Ul Hasan Siddiqui"},{"id":"100000956691585","name":"Sauliha Qureshi"},{"id":"598465514","name":"Noor- Un- Nahar"},{"id":"505917119","name":"Faiza Ahmed Amin"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA1OTE3MTE5","before":"NTU3MjE2MTAw"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_657169897667497/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNTA1OTE3MTE5"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"657173634333790","from":{"name":"Sarah J.K","id":"708025491"},"message":"man when you said you got robbed inside I was like, wtf!! and then i read the rest. lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-25T17:33:19+0000","like_count":36,"user_likes":false},{"id":"657173681000452","from":{"name":"Mehreen Rohan Shoaib","id":"503086792"},"message":"METOO! \u003dX","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-25T17:33:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"657179760999844","from":{"name":"Syed Wajih Ul Wahab","id":"727621585"},"message":"HEY...Sony TVs are awesome","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-25T17:48:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"657181040999716","from":{"name":"Faiza Ahmed Amin","id":"505917119"},"message":"So dramatic Talib!
