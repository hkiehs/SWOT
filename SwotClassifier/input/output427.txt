Went to Red Emperor with my craziest ex-colleagues, so i was really unable to take pix as i was busy chit chatting! Today i fell in love with RECB once again! Infact alot more now! Entered at 3:45pm(closing time) still the manager accommodated us (6 adults n 1 child). Crazy food, we ate like starved dogs (acha ok v were really bhooka!) Chicken chowmein was good, not something i\u0027d die for but the rest!!?? Allah I so wana be friends with the owner for some free treats, but I felt a lil odd asking the manager:p Hot n Sour was my die hard attraction! Prawn Toast(Sexiest of all),Emperor\u0027s CHicken, Crispy FIsh, Egg fried rice, Dry beef chilli all were yummeeekkhh!! Habibi just everything! Koi jaye tou mujhe bhi le jaye after all its economical! The ambiance helped for some long awaited photosession with the peeps too:p\nHad to request the waiter to keep the dessert menu away from us since we didn\u0027t want to over eat ( v had already done that!;p) So Red Emperor - China Bistro now every one would be bringing their families in soon! How about a Hot n Sour soup contract?;p","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-04T19:10:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-05T10:12:00+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"508776548","name":"Meher Saigol"},{"id":"746376004","name":"Sameen Shahid"},{"id":"668642026","name":"Talha Shahid"},{"id":"534880611","name":"Rabia Raza Hassan"},{"id":"100001882596023","name":"Mansoor Zaheer"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"100001857259546","name":"Umer Awan"},{"id":"100001562441083","name":"Nilam Jamil"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"100004489121967","name":"Oxma Imtiaz"},{"id":"1257283317","name":"Aymun Zafar"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTE3Mjk1Njc5Mw\u003d\u003d","before":"NTA4Nzc2NTQ4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"580551231996031","from":{"name":"Rabia Hai","id":"724148371"},"message":"Hey I went today with my family.

The Chapli Kababs are available both at Chapli Kabab House which is a Dhaaba for takeaway or eat in Dhaaba Style in open air and at Log Inn Lounge which is an air-conditioned comfy Lounge.  Both are in Tauheed Commercial Area of DHA.  Log Inn is at 32nd Street which is one lane before Hot Spot Ice Cream Shop and the Dhaaba is around the corner of 32nd Street which is 25th Street and is straight ahead from Evolution.  At Dhaaba you get regular and jumbo sizes both at Rs. 70 and Rs. 120 each in both beef and chicken.  The charbi walla are at Rs. 90 and Rs. 150 each for regular and jumbo respectively and only in beef.  You have option to add egg for Rs. 10 per Kabab.  You have to buy naan separately.  At Log Inn it\u0027s only available in a serving of 2 jumbo Kababs per plate with naan included.  The jumbo size at Log Inn is bigger than jumbo size at Dhaaba.  Prices at Log Inn for jumbo beef or chicken Chapli plate consisting of 2 Kababs is Rs. 350 and charbi wala peshawari beef chapli plate consisting of 2 jumbo Kababs is for Rs. 450.  The naan come complimentary at Log Inn and so does the egg.  I trust this is clear to all who are again again asking directions, price etc. etc. and both Chapli Kabab House and Log Inn Lounge are owned and operated by Najam Quddusi","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-20T18:18:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-04T21:30:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001052122235","name":"Xarrin Faizi"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100003898006618","name":"Zarfras Siddiki"},{"id":"584486829","name":"Haris Hanif Loya"},{"id":"100004102427163","name":"Malyha Shuja"},{"id":"1807053822","name":"Sahrish Naseer"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"100004993633855","name":"Mahzareen Mama"},{"id":"500293260","name":"Aamir Basrai"},{"id":"669370980","name":"Mahnaz Laique"},{"id":"1658011043","name":"Laiba Baig"},{"id":"1353892325","name":"Noman Sattar"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"100001306021747","name":"Tariq Ilyas"},{"id":"506498832","name":"Tanya Akhund"},{"id":"1367979764","name":"Shamsi Zia"},{"id":"792915494","name":"Ahmad Fayyaz Ali"},{"id":"516594686","name":"Farhiin Iqbal"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"1236316260","name":"Taimoor Nadeem"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"100000469529307","name":"Ali Safina"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNDY5NTI5MzA3","before":"MTAwMDAxMDUyMTIyMjM1"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_573992355985252/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dMTAwMDAwNDY5NTI5MzA3"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"573993465985141","from":{"name":"Sabrina Shahid","id":"589565258"},"message":"lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-20T18:21:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573994042651750","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":":P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-20T18:23:10+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573994169318404","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"lolzz! this is highly informative and hilarious simultaneously!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-20T18:23:41+0000","like_count":10,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573994772651677","from":{"name":"Saifullah Mazhar","id":"517287393"},"message":"Wow, once more please.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-20T18:26:04+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573995039318317","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"I went today for these Chapli Kebabs but I dint know log inn is closed 4-6!
