It\u0027s available 14 times a week - everyday for lunch as well as for dinner.  For me this Nihari is perfect and I find the flavour, taste and consistency to be better than the Nihari available at other places.  Some more surprises coming up soon by Log Inn Lounge but till then it\u0027s SUBAH NIHARI SHAAM NIHARI......enjoy
