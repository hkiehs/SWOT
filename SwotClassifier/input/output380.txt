Today at Kolachi i \n(and a couple of people in front of me) had to repeatedly tell people to go to the start of the line and not cut in the centre and if theyve already successfuly cut two people then please just put your own food and leave. Dont tell baby, pinky and gudoo to bring their plates so you can fill them till the food starts falling off their plates. \n\nAnd these are the same people who follow every single rule when theyre outside Pakistan.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-21T16:44:01+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-21T21:51:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"514264591","name":"Aena Rizvi"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"679913965","name":"Hina Dhanani"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"690005614","name":"Owais Asif"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"585967958","name":"Aleema Younus"},{"id":"642555611","name":"Umama Rizvi Walana"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000827449826","name":"Shahid Ali"},{"id":"100001897462646","name":"Akbar Yezdani"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"707095378","name":"Daniyal Usama"},{"id":"860510556","name":"Sabeen Qamar"},{"id":"1511932369","name":"Arham Bagasra"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"749361345","name":"Hasnain Raza"},{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"},{"id":"531715536","name":"Taimoor Aslam"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTMxNzE1NTM2","before":"NTE0MjY0NTkx"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_589756101075544/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNTMxNzE1NTM2"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"589756617742159","from":{"name":"Ibrahim Ahmed","id":"1131235634"},"message":"nice one","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T16:45:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589757214408766","from":{"name":"Rehman Saleemi","id":"812005693"},"message":"Kolachi and similar places around Kolachi have become very public recently.You get to see a mixed crowd there.

We got the \"Ramadan Deal for 2\" - which had an iftar platter, a choice main and a side and 2 drinks. So far so good. Its the food and service that came with an extra side of \"pathetic\" that totally ruined our evening. The iftar platter had 2 dates, 2 prawn wontons, 2 chicken dumplings and 4\\5 flattened, leather-like pieces of chicken atop a weird sauce (I didn\u0027t have the stomach to try it, but my guess is honey mustard, maybe?!). Anyway - wontons and dumplings were not bad. Chicken - made actual chamra look more appetizing. For the main, we ordered a sweet and sour chicken, which was average and you could count a total of 10 boneless chunks of chicken. Ordered lemon cooler, which came after 30 mins. The main come even after an hour of order and repeated requests to the waiter and manager. In the end, cancelled the remaining order which included the roasted chicken curry and fried icecream and got the hell out of that stupid place. Never again!!
