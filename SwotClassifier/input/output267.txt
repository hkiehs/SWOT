I don\u0027t know how I can possibly complain with that sort of a ratio. Secondly, these guys are willing to deliver a single slice of pizza to your doorstep anywhere in the city. A single slice!? I don\u0027t know how you can overlook that because I haven\u0027t heard of many pizza hubs around the world who would be willing to do that. Last but not least, having lived in Toronto for most of my life, I can easily say that the quality and taste of the pizza can enable 14th street to enter the global market if they work hard for it. Yes, I said it, their pizza is good enough to be potentially considered an international competitor.
