And then I hear mostly good reviews about the same place. And when I do try the place, the positive vibes have been proved correct. Kolachi and Tutti Frutti are the 2 places in subject here. \n\nHad the chocolate and the original flavor and I am at a loss for words. This was the most amazing willy-wonka-ish experience since Funland. I felt like a kid in Disneyland. The froyo is yummy, the place is oozing with colors, smiles, flavor and so much positivity. I was delighted! The delegate was in a rush so we couldnt wait for the toppings (sad) but they looked yum. But anyways the fro-yo was to-die-for. No after taste, the original was tangy..just enough tangy.....and the chocolate was a little like dark chocolate...and mixed together it was heaven. Oh yeah and it had the best consistency right till the last lick. And yes priced beautifully. P.S - No receipts. But oh well.\n\nKolachi. Man. Charcoal\u0027s ambiance has taken a back seat in my books. WHAT a place, tastefully done, EXCELLENT sofas and seating, Kolachi is a must-visit. Now for the food, FINALLY  a place on phase 8 that is a complete package! Food AND ambiance! Had the Hunzai Handi. OMG. It was divine. The right balance of spice and gravy with soft tender pieces of chicken that melts in your mouth, this is a must have. The bihari boti and paratha were nothing to write home about as I have had better. Honestly, these two items were Charcoal\u0027s standard. Bland. But that handi and oh yes! the prawn starter totally nailed it! The prices are steep - 1 starter, 1 handi and 1 plate bihari kebab, 2 nans and 1 paratha, 1 large water bottle and 1 drink Rs. 2180. Steep as the quantity was exactly for 2 people (nothing was left over) which means that it is expensive and less quantity (1000 per head) Having said that, if you have plans for phase 8, this is where u wanna go.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-31T19:45:34+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-01T09:26:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"828190023","name":"Shaheen Nouman"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQxNDk1NjI1","before":"ODI4MTkwMDIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"389951377722685","from":{"name":"Lubna Ashraf Jafri","id":"501447368"},"message":"Wow, sounds like someone had a great experience at both the places and is satiated :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-31T22:23:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"389951684389321","from":{"name":"Lubna Ashraf Jafri","id":"501447368"},"message":"I love both TF and Kolachi too :)\nTF gotta be my favorite place for froyo these days!

And i like mine well done so i made sure to tell him many times that it HAS to be well done, and thankfully it was. Juicy, flavorful and well done. My steak was just great. Loved the ambience, the food and even the music. I found their music collection to be quite up to date and nice. A combination of latest english, hindi AND pakistani tracks.
