It didn\u0027t taste bad but was not what we were looking for. Maybe they should call it something different so people don\u0027t have a preconceived notion about what they will be served? Pizza was average but not bad for the price. We had some cake and coffee as well (of course!). The Ferrero Rocher and Chocolate Fudge cakes were both DIVINE. The cookies were yummy as well. \n\nWhat made the place stand out though was the personalised service. I\u0027ll quote my toddler here (she loved the elmo cupcake!) who said that Bushra and hubby were \u0027the coolest people in the world\u0027. And why?

My mistake was in not asking if they offer alacarte at iftar time also. I had never intended to go there for buffet, and their response time is also lazy when a complaint was posted on their page. They had the standard pakoras (could not detect any Kaffir leaves in them) and spring rolls, sweet (and I do not mean that in a good way) tasting thai green curry with no exotic veggies in it, or lemon grass, or thai basil, very run of the mill penne pasta, and really bad dessert, other than one pineapple cake. The beef medallion with peppercorns was decent. They also told us kids 5 and under were free, but then decided to charge the 3 five year olds and 1 two year old as one adult, which is fine, but they should have informed us. Then there was a 10% service charge if the table was seating 6, so with the kids added as an adult, we ended up being 6, and we, like idiots also tipped them, so 5 ladies at our table ended up paying Rs.1700 per person for food I cook wayyy better at home! Saira Malik, when I went there were some herbed potatoes too, which tasted suspiciously like masala aloo to me. If the food was good, I would not have minded paying more, had the food been worth it, but for now, I am irritated by this place, and don\u0027t like the way they handle their complaints.

Unfortunately I am not always on facebook. As I had mentioned previously, I had left my laptop at work on Sunday and we are closed on mondays, which is why there was a delay. However, prior to that I had answered all of your queries/complaints in a very prompt manner. As for your children, we have a policy of charging children half, when you had asked on the phone they had assumed they were very young, yes that is a mistake on my staff that they had assumed your children were under two and should have asked you at that time. My apologies for that. \nAs for charging you Rs.1600/- which has now become Rs.1700/-. I will provide the break up for you as follows:\n5 adults @ Rs.1044/-\n4 children (charged at 25% and not 50%)\u003d 1 adult @ Rs.1044/-\nThere was also 1 coke which is charged at Rs.144/-\nSadly living in a country such as Pakistan there is a compulsory 16% gst charged by the government and not the restaurant. \nYes we had charged you as 6 adults, and automatically in my system there is a 10% service charged on 6 persons or more. I do apologize for that but it is as per company policy. I do believe it is standard in most establishments to charge a service charge over 6 or 8 persons. \n \nI do apologize that you did not enjoy the buffet. There is no excuse for that. I do wish you would have said something at the time, and I would have been more than glad to make it up to you. The one thing I hate is any of my customers to leave unhappy. This is our first year in business and our first Ramadan, I do agree on the buffet aspect, as I am sure you are all aware food quality does go down in a buffet. However we felt it would be better as people could dine as much as they would like with out leaving hungry. However, as far as our food quality being poor overall, I do request you come in and try our dinner, I am sure many here can vouch for us. But hey, if anyone has any suggestions I am always open to hear them, after all this is hospitality. If we are not going to listen to our respected customers, then whats the point of being in business. \nSaira Faruqi if you still feel cheated in any way what so ever, my personal number is 0332-8208829.

I am undergoing medical treatment that gives me a very short span of time when I can call my tastebuds my own, and I guess I have zero tolerance right now for not getting the quality of food that I was expecting from Forty4.
