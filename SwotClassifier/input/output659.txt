The \"Gosht Nu Dhansak\" (Mutton Daal with Brown Rice) with the kachumar and two types of achaars stole the show, specially the limun aur mirch ka achaar which is made with lemon, ginger and green chillies soaked in lemon juice made me go back over 25 years when this used to be made in our house. Not a big fan of eggs but I must say both the Akoori (scrambled eggs) and Scotch Eggs, both were pretty decent. My earliest memories of Akoori dates back to over 30 years when it was served as a snack in the evenings in the lawns and tennis courts of Karachi Club. The Kolmi Na Kevab (Prawn Kebabs) was very interesting. Was so satisfied with the Dhansak that I didn\u0027t try the \"Patra Ni Machi\" (Fish in Green Chutney rolled in Banana Leaves). The \"Lagan Nu Custard\", \"Malpuras\" and \"Savaiyyan\" for dessert were so different and delicious - could not stop my hand at \"Savaiyyan\" and ended up having two large helpings of it. Olivetto - Great Job!!! You should have these speciality lunches more often. A special thanks to Zarnak Sidhwa.
