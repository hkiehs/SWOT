Unfortunately, the good part almost ends here.. the turkey jalapeno pizza was served on a thin crust which suited us all just fine except for the topping didn\u0027t go down too well.. it was a bit bland for our liking. the Cajun Jambalaya was a huge disappointment, as one of the friends mentioned, it seemed like a desi version of regular pasta and the spice mix tasted almost like ghar ka salan, with coriander powder and chili flakes.. while the pasta was smeared in spice mix, the shrimps on the side were almost bland and not something we\u0027d want served in a restaurant.. \nthe most commendable part of the evening however was when the owner paid a random visit at our table to get our feedback and when informed of our experience with the jambalaya, he admitted of receiving mixed reviews, graciously accepted the criticism with a smile, apologized instead of taking offence and offered us a serving each of two best seller desserts, on the house! a gesture very well appreciated by us all.. \nthe chocolate tart that he personally recommended was a tad bitter, he warned us before hand, but then most of us liked it just the way it was! the red velvet cheesecake was just about ok.. the cheese part was yummilicious however we found the crust to be way too hard. like he said, the choco tart is a definitely a must try at Pantry, so much so that a friend in the group proclaims to have gone off the cheesecakes in favor of those chocolate tarts! :-)\nwe wish the management all the best in keeping up their good food standards, the hygiene and well lit ambiance and hope they will overcome the minute glitches in no time..... hope to return back to the place soon!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-24T20:26:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-27T07:05:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575802952","name":"Ayesha Farooqi"},{"id":"764425006","name":"Alisa Zulfiqar Zuberi"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"1120122270","name":"Shehla Khurram"},{"id":"633230637","name":"Mahnaz Hadi"},{"id":"512577683","name":"Salik Sajid"},{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"100000125904027","name":"Samad Tariq"},{"id":"100004102427163","name":"Malyha Shuja"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"709896077","name":"Asma Asghar"},{"id":"1488375731","name":"Salim Khoonjee"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"785615314","name":"Maleeha Jawaid"},{"id":"100000554344923","name":"Salman Khan Nizari"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEyMDkxMjYx","before":"NTc1ODAyOTUy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"561593153891839","from":{"name":"Maleeha Jawaid","id":"785615314"},"message":"Oh wow.
