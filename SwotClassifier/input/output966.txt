Ali Hussain, I have tried their burgers from day 1 and I love them. BTB has recently been opened by my bro in law and wife and my hubby is helping them. This would disqualify me as a reviewer, but since I am also their Biggest critic (I\u0027m totally evil) I thought I\u0027d give it a try. My fav is The Most Wanted (hubby\u0027s secret recipe and the idea behind BTB) for me \u0027its to die for\u0027. I also like the Texan, the Jalepeno\u0027s give it the perfect tang  and the California Mushroom for a bit of change. The patties are succulent and the charbroiling gives it that great flavor. I also love the fries and the coleslaw. All of these I have had in beef (which I prefer in a burger) so cant comment on the chicken one\u0027s. I like the fact that the bun doesn\u0027t fall apart while eating and the delivery time gets them to me still hot. (I still have to pay for them, no family discounts :) They haven\u0027t started lunch yet, but will soon. So far they open at 4pm. Our friends who have tried BTB have also responded very very positively. I think they will make a mark in the competitive world of burgers, there are a few teething problems but they are totally committed to it and I\u0027m sure everything will soon be streamlined. You can check out the menu and the reviews on their web site http://www.bigthickburgerz.com/index.html   if you have any comments /feedback after trying, do let me know so I can pass them on as they are not very active on FB yet.
