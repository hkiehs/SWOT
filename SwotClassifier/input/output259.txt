But the person who took my call offered to keep the place open and reserve me a table which is by far sweetest thing ever.\n\nUpon reaching, there was already someone waiting at the door for me. I was seated at their best spot. Now for the order. Well since I already had dinner so didn\u0027t.order something heavy just their lemon chicken and Dhakka Chicken. \nTo be honest I was expecting below average food as I had invaded them after they had already closed. But NO!!! I was served with fresh and heavenly tasting dishes. \n\nBoth the dishes were hot, fresh and tasted perfect. I personally loved the lemon chicken. It was creamy tangy and perrrfect.\nThe place was spotless and everything was perfect.\n\nOverall 10/10 will defiantly go back in a day or so for a complete dinner.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-23T15:34:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-24T00:00:37+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100006083859539","name":"Muhammad Amir"},{"id":"518981526","name":"Faryal Shah"},{"id":"1718458022","name":"Anwar Hashim"},{"id":"100000424156000","name":"Afza Khan"},{"id":"524835210","name":"Ali Dayo"},{"id":"732365126","name":"Shehla Zuberi"},{"id":"100000169425889","name":"Huma Sikandar"},{"id":"100000537867391","name":"Jawad Multani"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"692650033","name":"Shahbaz Khan"},{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"1429600174","name":"Shumail Ahmad"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"648503715","name":"Ahsan Mansoor Khan"},{"id":"100001388892633","name":"Zahra Mirza"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"100004544739993","name":"Anum Shafi"},{"id":"653605594","name":"Muniba Ahmed"},{"id":"718836477","name":"Soofia Shaikh"},{"id":"588690602","name":"Hamza Badar"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA1OTkwMTU1","before":"MTAwMDA2MDgzODU5NTM5"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_608519535865867/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNTA1OTkwMTU1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"608522965865524","from":{"name":"Imran Latif","id":"100003283819114"},"message":"dekha I tld u naa? u will be servd with the bestt...(Y)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-23T15:49:38+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"608523745865446","from":{"name":"Umar Asad","id":"686720963"},"message":"thank you. come again","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-23T15:52:16+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"608530975864723","from":{"name":"Khalid Saleem","id":"657031744"},"message":"do they extend this sort of courtesy to guys too???","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-23T16:17:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"608531375864683","from":{"name":"Umar Asad","id":"686720963"},"message":"never Khalid Saleem. ladies are treated specially everywhere","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-23T16:18:54+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem","type":"user","offset":6,"length":13}]},{"id":"608531782531309","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Well I\u0027m pretty sure that is not the case.
