I had ordered a deal which consisted of large 20 inch pizza, 6 chicken wings and 4 cheesy breads plus 5 sauces and drink. Pizza was very much like 14th street, which is a complement, good amount of filling and cheese, wings were BBQ flavor and hence not too good but obviously that\u0027s my fault as i didnt ordered properly as I coudnt understand the CS guy on phone cz he was speaking too fast. cheesy bread with pepperoni was Ok. I didnt understood the idea behind the sauces, they all looked same and didnt tasted too different. We were 6 ppl and coud\u0027nt finish the pizza, in-fact had only half of it..though i know we all are light eaters so that might be the reason behind finding the quantity huge, i would say it was definitely Value for money as atleast 8 ppl (light eaters like us) can eat that deal for only Rs. 2000!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-26T05:16:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-26T09:18:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1620471256","name":"Shahbaz Javed Khan"},{"id":"635343410","name":"Haroon Khan"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTgzNDQ2OTQ4","before":"MTYyMDQ3MTI1Ng\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"592684584116029","from":{"name":"Shaireen Ahmed","id":"855329100"},"message":"I had a pretty bad experience with their pizza, a couple of days ago.

The experience over all was not too good not too bad. The service was rather slow, we asked ice like a million times for our lemonade and only then they gave us some. \n\nFor 1250 per head I was at least expecting 40+ dishes but alas that was not the case. The basic items for iftar were  beef samosas, vege rolls, channa chat, dhai barey, chicken cheese sandwiches and chicken wings. Channa chat was too spicy, nothing special about beef samosas but the sandwiches were good. There were 3 different types of salads out of which I only tried the macaroni one which I felt had a strong taste of chilli garlic ketchup. Iftar platter gets a 7 out of 10.\n\nThe main course had soup, alferdo pasta, small mushroom and pepper steaks, chicken chilli kind of something, mashed potatoes, drumsticks,  fried fish and I guess one other thing which I am forgetting. I will give an average of 6 out of10 on taste of the main courses. \n\nDessert Bar was the only delight with strawberry cheesecake, chocolate fudge cake, chocolate clairs, pineapple cake, chocolate mousse cake and pudding. Dessert Bar gets 8 out of 10.\n\nOverall experience 6 out of 10. My only suggestion would be to introduce variety of dishes instead of few.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-26T05:13:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-26T06:59:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100004345385201","name":"Syed Sharjeel Tirmizi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDA0MzQ1Mzg1MjAx","before":"MTAwMDA0MzQ1Mzg1MjAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"592661614118326","from":{"name":"Ahmad Owais","id":"688715909"},"message":"How would you rate the taste?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T05:53:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"592661857451635","from":{"name":"Bushra Joyo","id":"1421223164"},"message":"Average.
