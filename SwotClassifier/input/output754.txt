The punch was to.die.for. I think I finished the jug myself singlehandedly. Redefines the word refreshing, for sure. The wings are truly as scrumptious as one hears of them. The unsung heroes are the Spicy Ladies. The beauty of bharvein mirchein at Log Inn is the fact that they are not deseeded so What You See is What You Get. I\u0027m not much of a burger fan but the only way I like mine is where the beef gets its due respect. At Log Inn Lounge, the burger was the best I\u0027ve had in a very long while. I think I\u0027m spoiled for good. I don\u0027t reckon I\u0027ll be able to stomach the regular run of the mill burgers any more.
