Most of the population can\u0027t afford to have good ice cream, they see froyo shops, and think of it\u0027ll be too expensive for us, and walk past. Some people are simply scared of trying out new places. Some want the best tasting stuff you can get.\n\nPersonally, I\u0027ve received quite a few extra ingredients from our fast food chains/franchises such as hairs, insects, bones, once we even got a chicken\u0027s heart on a pizza from pizza hut. A hair wrapped around a steak from Kahva, etc etc.\n\nThese experiences, combined with over the top prices put people off.\n\nIt\u0027s sad that we criticize more than praise here, but the problem is, we have to have something to praise. Overpriced food that doesn\u0027t live up to the standards set by the parent company abroad or the actual standards of such a restaurant isn\u0027t something to appreciate.\n\nHave to be candid and honest about things when you\u0027re reviewing, specially food, because if we praise a place and it isn\u0027t that good, someone might just end up with food poisoning or something else because they took our word for it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-10T10:00:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"631280630256424","from":{"name":"Ali Haider Bhatti","id":"559545082"},"message":"come on guys its not about quality or quantity or what so ever ...
