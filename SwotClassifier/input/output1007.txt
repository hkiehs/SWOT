I ordered the belly dancer, Genie Wings, Chicken Al-Mandi (with Pita) and last but not the least Chickilicious Kaafta on Rice, along with the three fantastic and good flavored dips. Aamir who took the order informed me that if I make an order over 500 they could deliver at Clifton, but i should give an hour, no issues, they at-least made the effort, food arrived half an hour late due to some logistical issues, they also called and apologized, which was very professional, no problem, it was really a meal fit for a Sheikh. Few recommendations, chicken could be a little more tender and slightly more spicy, and the food was cold so I had to have it re-heated, is it possible to improve on ways and means to keep the food warm, considering the distance, what is the option for take away. How much prior notice is required? And would the food remain hot? Guys really good quality and clean, I look forward to another visit very soon.

From chicken Al-mandi i really liked the chicken it was a big piece and really soft and tender from the inside while having a thin juicy layer above, the rice could have been better as it was a bit rough and lacked taste and few pieces were stuck to each other and the spicy sauce that came with it wasnt too spicy and i suggest to make the consistency thicker so i felt that its better to order the chicken with pita bread. The chikita wasnt the authentic shawarma i hoped it to be it was chicken pieces on a skewer but the chicked tasted good. It came with pita bread and garlic tahini sauce and i asked for muttabil sauce which they gave eventhough they usually dont give it with the chikita and both sauces were great so good customer service oh and it also came with fries which were reallly really good and my bill was 318 so that was really good value for money and the food quantity was great too and since they\u0027ve just started i hope they will improve :)","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-14T07:22:32+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-14T07:22:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTIxOTA4NDU0","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_277347365649754","from":{"name":"Maliha Zia Lari","id":"505666198"},"message":"Can one get Irani or Turkish food in khi?","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-13T19:41:14+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-14T07:06:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524990051","name":"Ovais Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI0OTkwMDUx","before":"NTI0OTkwMDUx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"277351795649311","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"cafe Subhan in saddar for Iranian  food - Turkish i don\u0027t think anyone has a fixed Turkish menu - some do specials","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-13T19:49:36+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"277356922315465","from":{"name":"Farees Shah","id":"515618115"},"message":"Your husband asked the same question on this forum around a week ago - clearly you guys need to talk more...haha.

Being a regular steak eater and NOT into bunches of non-carnivore dishes, imagine the horror of me planning a visit to Raj Rasoi! But my beloved wife, Mariyam Masood wanted to go; so today we went for lunch with a couple of friends! Happy to report that it was a great experience. Nice little touches like the hand washing before and after the meal. Enjoyed many of the options available ... not a big bhindi or baingan person so I passed on those but was very pleasantly surprised at everything else. The daal was great, the chicken was surprisingly good as was the mutter paneer. Combine this with great puris and attentive yet non-intrusive service, it was a really enjoyable meal in a nice setting. The dessert was channay ka halwa, not one of my staple favourites but still enjoyed it. Mariyam will post her own comments but both our friends also had nothing but praise for the Raj Rasoi experience. The final icing on the cake was the surprise of buy one, get 50% off the second lunch special that I had no idea about but was grateful for!! With tip, the total was about 700 per head which is infinitely reasonable for a good meal, great service and ambiance. I would say that even if its not a place you might frequent, it is well worth a visit!!","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-13T15:53:41+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-14T06:20:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"100000578236531","name":"Naheed Asim"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nzc3NjQ3ODAy","before":"MTAwMDAyMzc0OTE3MDM5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"277240342327123","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"As with any food place, one must keep an open mind and be flexible.
