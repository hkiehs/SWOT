Order was taken efficiently and my many queries answered patiently. Food was delivered piping hot and within the hour time frame given. The rider was courteous and reminded us to check the order before he drove away. Food was packed well and easy to transfer to serving platters. The order consisted of 3 beef with garlic and chillies (dry), 2 manchurian chicken, 2 chicken chillies with veg, 1 american chopsuey, 3 steamed rice and 2 large cola bottles. The bill was just under Rs, 4000 including tax. Each dish tasted delicious and with it\u0027s own full flavour rather than a generic taste. Food was eaten with gusto and enjoyed by all, although we did find the chicken chilli with veg to be a tad bit too spicy even though we all love spicy food. A note to self to order a milder dish next time and just add some of the condiments of soy, chilli and vinegar given. The helpings were generous and more than enough to satisfy healthy eaters- 7 of us for dinner and even with seconds (and for some thirds), there\u0027s enough left over for lunch tomorrow. All in all an excellent experience with Golden Dragon. Will definitely order it again.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-14T20:16:44+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-15T11:16:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"646760193","name":"Rehma Tirmizey"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"659370395","name":"M Areeb Rehman"},{"id":"583855802","name":"Rima Aziz"},{"id":"592929129","name":"Aqsa Jaliawala"},{"id":"100000635773324","name":"Shariq Nazr"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"564151757","name":"Farheen Shah-Khan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"ODQ2NjY0NTM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"603238149727339","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Qamarunnisa Asim - kudos!
