Just a delicious pizza, probably the best around if one is looking for that greasy pizza full of flavor.  Lets call it the Johari Deep Pan.\n\nMost would not be aware of Miss Hen, unless they have spent some time at the IBA Main Campus, or live in NA-253.  The pizza just has insane amount of topping, and is full of flavor.  It may not be the most pleasant looking pizza, but tastes bloody amazing, and beats any of these available fancy pizzas by a mile, at a fraction of cost.\n\nHighly Recommended for those who are willing to experiment.\n\nOverall Rating -- 8.5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-13T20:54:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-14T12:55:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"777000220","name":"Ata Ur Rehman"},{"id":"513059748","name":"Tracy Roque"},{"id":"519570353","name":"Khushboo Zahra"},{"id":"100003533323814","name":"Sarah Muhammad"},{"id":"546027973","name":"Abdul Ahad Saud"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1547568629","name":"Danish Khan"},{"id":"100001177844959","name":"Sameer Siddiqui"},{"id":"838344921","name":"Wajeeh Hasan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"591166408","name":"Faisal M.

So on a 13000bill we had to pay 1300 extra and then tip alag se. Wow!\n\nSo we complained to the manager and he said umm ok ok ap na dein (that meant it was in his hands to either charge those extra 10% or not) he made sure the others don\u0027t hear this or else no one will give. Causs usually we never check bills we jjst pay right away specially when going to such big restaurants and where the check is computerized. But luckily we did and to our knowledge the extra 10% was extremely a dissatisfaction. \n\nPs. If you guys go don\u0027t pay them those extra 10%.\n\nAnd then oh yea, we paid the bill and we gave the tip since we were really mad at them so we gave 350rs.
