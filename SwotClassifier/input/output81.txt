The story  begins when I thought of grabbing a club sandwich after a long tiring day at work . Couple of friends had recommend del club sandwich,and my previous experience with the moroccon chicken was good  so was clear what I wanted to satisfy my hunger panks!  Just to save some time I thought of making the order on phone . I placed my order at 8pm  and the guy over the phone told me to pick in 20 mins from Sindhi Muslim branch. I was there on time all excited about my club sandwich and at the same time totally hypoglycemic  as I had not eaten any thing since morning! When I told them that I was there to collect my pre ordered sandwich along with the order no .The guy looked blank as if I was talking French , then came another extra smart person who asked me to repeat the order, so I repeated what I had ordered. I was disappointed to see that there wasn\u0027t  any sense of responsibility or even concern , they all looked so calm as if it was no bigee. Finally they asked me to wait another 20 mins to get it prepared as there was a communication gap from the call center. Now comes the worst part! The management dint apologize for the delay ! There was no courtesy of accepting the mistake, they dint even say a single word to show that they messed up ! I wonder if they are aware of these two words as \" customer care\" del impressed e big time on my first visit but this was disappointing . The delay dint offend me much but the non apologetic and indifferent behavior was surely a huge turn off .","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-20T16:18:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-22T08:02:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100004259941160","name":"Nadia Baqar"},{"id":"1579977743","name":"Amena Zoeb"},{"id":"100003495204029","name":"Noman Faysal"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"189100160","name":"Ehtesham Maqbool"},{"id":"100003971348832","name":"Ingloriously Vain Faced"},{"id":"100001583472497","name":"Anas Farooqui"},{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"558178102","name":"Safoora Fahad"},{"id":"727305404","name":"Zain Anjum"},{"id":"714985532","name":"Aamenah Anwar"},{"id":"726085463","name":"Zohaib Hasan"},{"id":"100000579313166","name":"Xobi Shah"},{"id":"759025230","name":"Hassan Jan"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"100001822097920","name":"Sara Kazmi"},{"id":"100001025670320","name":"Faizan Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMDI1NjcwMzIw","before":"MTAwMDA0MjU5OTQxMTYw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"654420871275733","from":{"name":"Najia Ahmed","id":"819424477"},"message":"** hunger pangs","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-20T16:58:49+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"654428904608263","from":{"name":"Rabeet Rao","id":"749204552"},"message":"Ouch.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-20T17:05:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"654429521274868","from":{"name":"Sameen Shahid","id":"746376004"},"message":"The food is average and the service is pathetic at del frio smchs","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-20T17:07:08+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"654429851274835","from":{"name":"Rabeet Rao","id":"749204552"},"message":"I\u0027ve always had great experiences at Del Frio SMCHS.
