After picking Saffron as our second choice, we ordered clear vegetable soup, avocado and prawn salad, mediterranean chicken, shishtaouk chicken. Soup and salad arrived after waiting for quite some time but that wasn\u0027t too long plus a complimentary starter platter with hummus crackers and vegetables was served, hummus was good. Soup was good but salad was an absolute winner, loved it and won\u0027t mind going back just for the salad. I had shishtaouk for main, chicken was tender and flavourful and rice it was served with had a nice arabic flavour, though chicken was a little too spiced up. mediterranean chicken had a good flavour too but the chicken fillet i tasted wasn\u0027t tender at all, it was hard and chewy, so i mentioned it to the floor manager and he apologetically offered to replace it, but we declined as we were full by then. So the dining experience that started beautifully with that perfect salad ended not so perfectly due to badly cooked chicken. But so far so good as we were already offered a replacement which we declined ourselves. Then the bill arrived, and they charged us for mains ordered by the table next to us(it was server\u0027s fault) so it had to be rectified and then we were sent a bill for the items that we ordered. But again there was a mistake as some items were billed higher than they were listed on the menu(that had something to do with software not being updated as per menu prices). So that had to be corrected as well. Overall the staff showed courtesy to fix all the issues and apologized appropriately(though after so many hiccups in one night, there should be something complimentary offered LOL, greedy me). And all that made the overall experience rather average what could have been something much better. Not rushing back anytime soon.. And yes Patio here we come(soon)!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-24T12:21:49+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-24T12:21:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"764425006","name":"Alisa Zulfiqar Zuberi"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTgyOTYwNTc1","before":"NzY0NDI1MDA2"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_426921004025722","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"...","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-22T20:13:43+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-24T12:20:10+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001347983558","name":"Abid Qureshi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMzQ3OTgzNTU4","before":"MTAwMDAxMzQ3OTgzNTU4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"426921157359040","from":{"name":"Ali Khan","id":"571016150"},"message":"Hungry?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-22T20:14:37+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"427195567331599","from":{"name":"Zubair Uddin","id":"704566421"},"message":"This definitely is not related to food :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-23T16:52:58+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"427236133994209","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"What\u0027s up girl......why so dotty","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-23T19:11:43+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"427238767327279","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"Always hungry except when I\u0027m asleep.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-23T19:18:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"427238860660603","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"Nezihe Hussain I want Nandos!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-23T19:19:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"427259897325166","from":{"name":"Ayesha Saeed","id":"570766058"},"message":"Ha? ?d Love sum nandos too but ?ve recebtly herd such crap th?gs about the?r serv?ce ANd food.

I guess the there was a misunderstanding between the phone operator and you. Due to the Eid holidays we are getting a lot of rush Mashallah. Therefore we were  taking the last reservation for 8.30 . What we were trying to communicate to all our valued customers was to come around 8.30 to get guaranteed seats without waiting. \nDue to Eid rush , we wre getting packed by walk-in customers by 8.00 or maximum 8.15 which is unusual. Now honouring a 9.30 reservation becomes difficult because we can never imagine to ask any of our customers to leave or get up from the table. So the customers arriving after 8.30  are requested to wait until the table gets free. \n\nNevertheless we are still working on further streamlining the reservation system through which we could easily accommodate customers asking for reservation after 8.30 by introducing the time slot system. \n\nBut still Shiraz my apologies once again for any inconvenience caused. \n\nYOU AND OTHER CUSTOMERS LIKE YOU ARE THE REAL SPIRIT OF KOLACHI AND YOU WOULD ALWAYS BE OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-23T22:24:59+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"427387550645734","from":{"name":"Shiraz Qureshi","id":"574028031"},"message":"thanks for your response Syed Faizan Rahim. i totally understand your point and i m sure the crowd u guys are handlng these days is definitely huge.  i loved the way you guys hv made this place and thts the reason wanted to bring my whole family for my younger brothers birthday dinner tonight.. we wil b trying our luck around 8 - 830 with a family of 15 to 18 ppl. hope we get lucky.  :) …and yeah you definitely need to upgrade the reservation process ! ;) . all the best. and keep up the good work.
