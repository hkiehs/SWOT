Went to Berrylicious\u0027 new joint and tried the vanilla froyo. It was not to my liking as I found it to be too sweet and lacking the tartness of yogurt and hence is not recommended. \n\nWent to Deli for dinner. For the starter I ordered Tom Yum soup with prawns. There was nothing Tom Yummy about it as I felt it lacked the clearness and the spiciness of an authentic Tum Yum. The soup\u0027s  was quite thick and it was not very spicy. Nonetheless it was very very good and should be tried but Deli should perhaps changing the name of that soup to something else. Main course, ordered Wasabi Beef Sandwich which was pretty decent. One of the better sandwiches I have had in Karachi. Had the right combination of wasabi and was served with excellent fries. \n\nThen headed across the street to Cafe Blue Ginger for their excellent Bread Pudding served piping hot with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream and cream. I had been wanting to try that for a while. It was quite good too and very filling. For the price I felt it is excellent value for money.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-14T20:01:39+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-15T08:31:42+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"379197338798089","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"you forgot to add the cheese cake, the melon ice cream (with chunks of fresh aromatic melon) the pizza that Reshma Rajpar ordered...and not to mention the raw kairi panaa we drank.|\n\nyeah foodwise - we were all very SWOTTED today.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-14T20:07:37+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar","type":"user","offset":108,"length":13}]},{"id":"379198395464650","from":{"name":"Sarah J.K","id":"708025491"},"message":"u guys are champs dude...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-14T20:09:23+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"379201212131035","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100003681493822"},"message":"ur bread pudding lookeddd sooo tempting to me but will powerrrr : didn\u0027t even taste a bite as I knew if I had a bite too I\u0027d want the whole thing..did u try da cheesecake nez ordered?

Reservations were made and finally got there just a few mins past the time with my mum and mother in law( The 2 special ladiesin my life). We decided not to take the 5 course meal as both mums were watching their diets and appetities had shrunk, luckily the courteous manager informed us that they were also taking order from the regular menu. They had kept a choclate fondue on one side with  wafers which my kids went crazy for and were unstoppable till the end. ( hope there were some left for others). Ordered Mushroom chicken, Grilled chicked with dijon mustard, Chicken with jalepeno sauce, Ceaser salad, Fetticuni etc. Absolutely delicious food, with great sauces. sides. They were kind enough to put extra chunks of chicken in the already yummy caeser and gave us extra dressing. btw to note: we asked for extra sauces twice for the griled chicken and both times they gave us plenty of it and didnt charge extra. Chicken was little overdone which we complained about and they graciously accepted. Didnt order too much as kept room for their wonderful desserts most particularly mentionable is the Molten cake( which is absolutely divine) hot choclate cake stuffed with oozing choc sauce served with vanilla icecream..unfortunately couldnt get more than a bite as my kids gobbled it up in no time, The rich creme brulee was as usual perfect( btw havent tried better creme brulee than CBG) Hussain Tariq and his very lovely and elegant wife Saba Hussain  played perfect host/hostess to a packed house. All in all an unforgettable day and a perfect choice for such a important day for my family. Both my mothers came out smiling which was soo satisfying.  Thankyou Mr and Mrs Hussain Tariq and the staff for such a great experience. Totally worth it!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-14T16:21:21+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-15T02:43:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"573859815","name":"Nighat Khan"},{"id":"764425006","name":"Alisa Zulfiqar Zuberi"},{"id":"100000391823197","name":"Farah S.
