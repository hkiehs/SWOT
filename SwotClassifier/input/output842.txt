It was so rich and creamy. Mmm! ? We asked the waiter to pack the remaining food.\n\nThen my brother ordered chocolate fudge ice-cream for dessert, which was okay. And me and my parents ordered zafrani kulfi, it was amazing! \n\nOverall experience was wonderful.

I used to be an enthusiast for Gun Smoke burgers and steaks, my personal favourite was the Blue cheese burger (but somehow it doesn\u0027t really go with the Pakistani taste palette and I was always worried that they will knock it off the menu). Then i heard that they are closing down their Zamzama spot to open at Dolmen mall (I did not agree but did I have a choice? No) so moving on I bump into their new location whilst a stroll in the mall with my family and we decided to have food there. I was surprised to see the menu, no blue cheese, that\u0027s not all. ALL burgers and ALL steaks now come with four standard sauces/ choices (pretty bad ones). To top that, the burgers have one awfully small, dry and terribly tasteless, from succulent, juicy and mouthwatering, this is quite a downer I tell you! What they have done is that they have gone the way of the masses, industrious burgers, slightly cheaper price tags and standardised taste. Fine if it works for you but I am sure it doesn\u0027t for all the customers you carefully cultivated over the years, for me, Gunsmoke is dead!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-20T19:44:21+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-21T19:58:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"517047385","name":"Amber Zuberi Esbhani"},{"id":"100002928478909","name":"Rabia Ahmed"},{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"509507958","name":"Omair Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5NTA3OTU4","before":"NTE3MDQ3Mzg1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"401204563264033","from":{"name":"Sarah Ashraf","id":"643405172"},"message":"eeep, how disappointing that they have become standardized,  I quite liked their original idea and product .","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T20:24:37+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401233199927836","from":{"name":"Sarah J.K","id":"708025491"},"message":"this is depressing","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T21:21:20+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401499216567901","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":":(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-21T08:55:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401508499900306","from":{"name":"Syed Adeel Ahmed","id":"635540096"},"message":"looks like all the capital went in procuring uncessary hoo haa and expensive equipment.
