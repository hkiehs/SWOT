Just had breakfast at Pane Amore...Other than being ridiculously good value for money (half price deal till tues) the ambiance was refreshing...loved their all white interior. The service and hospitality great. Their peanut butter and chocolate cupcake was food-gasmically yumm! Omlettes were the best eggs I have had in a long time we had the spinach bacon n cheese and bacon n pesto. Cant decide which was better so it was a good job we ordered both and shared ;0) I think what made them so good was the quality of cheese used...it was REAL cheese. The hash browns however I think need to be re-thought...they were more of the aloo ke patties type texture with bread crumbs on them. Loved the herby grilled tomato though. The pancakes also need to be re-thought...we had the ricotta cheese and apples. There wasnt enough fruit on them. And the actual pancakes were a little limp and doughy. Perhaps asking the customer if they want white or brown bread instead of being given both would have been nice and butter or jam. The omlettes and cupcakes though totally made up for these tiny blimps. I will be back there (v soon) for more!!
