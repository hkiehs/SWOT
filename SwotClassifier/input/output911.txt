Arrived right behind the car of Hussain Tariq\u0027s small tiny cafe. The valet was at his car door, but instead he came to me. That is customer service. Inside, the tiny place was packed to the brim. I think a single khajoor table was free. \nWe took the five course deal, 1290 a head.\n\nCustom baked lasagne for my daughter. The two waiters were stressed to the max. So I knew everything would be slowish. The fondant fountain was a great idea. My kids and all the others really enjoyed it. very good idea. People were being turned away.\n\nFood was quite good. Fried Calamari was very good, the tarragon infused vinegar cole slaw was very nice. The soup was acceptable, The portion sizes and pricing points just show that Blue Ginger is great value for money. The Ceasar needs an overhaul, no anchovies to speak of. The seafood rissotto....brilliance, delicate perfectly cooked carnoli rice, amazingly fresh and tender seafood. Bloody awesome dish.\n\nThe bad. Sadly, the creme brulee was awful, greasy smoky and not acceptable. The cheese cake was very nice, didn\u0027t need the coulis or apple slices, a small slice of well made cake in a small plate is far better than a serving platter with decorations. One AC leaked like Niagra falls. Small issues for a great place. if you get one thing out of this, The deal was great value for money, I now realize there are signature dishes, I just have to find them.

They are awesome. \n\nFinally, the directions to Cafe Hassan are quite simple.If you are going from Clifton or M.A.Jinnah Road, go past Civil Hospital, and turn left towards Lady Dufferin Hospital. Continue  straight past Lady Dufferin and past the Lighthouse flea market crossing, and about 500  yards down the road, you will see Cafe Hassan on your right.
