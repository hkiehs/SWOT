Loved how pretty and clean it was! Spotted the Mr. Burger mobile *happy dance* and the meal was exceptional. Childhood nostalgia was brought on full force with that distinct flavor which only the Mr. Burger patty has. Tried out the chocolate fountain next to the Crepe Factory and loved the assortment of goodies they had for us to drench in chocolate. Bananas, apples, marshmallows (Not the pink and white ones, these were honest-to-goodness marshmallows) and wafers. Moved on to The Bistro after that, since our sweet tooth wasn\u0027t quite satisfied, and sat outside, taking advantage of the lovely weather and the gorgeous greenery and comfy seating arrangement they have there. Ordered the Toffee Cream something-something and the divine chocolate lava cake. Forgive me, I don\u0027t recall the exact names at the moment, but I can tell you that the chocolate confection gorgeous! The molten chocolate just wouldn\u0027t stop flowing from the cake, and the caramel inside the toffee cream thingie added the perfect crunch of sweetness in contrast to the heaviness of the cream. We came back most impressed, both with the food and the atmosphere. Not a bad thing to say about the place.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-09T19:09:37+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-09T19:10:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"677666360","name":"Fazal Gafur"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njc3NjY2MzYw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"293206740730483","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"*was gorgeous.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-09T19:10:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjkzMjA2NzQwNzMwNDgz","before":"MjkzMjA2NzQwNzMwNDgz"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_292566120794545","from":{"name":"Gulnaz Ghausi","id":"833385065"},"message":"An extended family day out, sun, fun n frolick.. n how can u forget food.. with some thirty odd people ended up at ideal snacks \u0026 family restaurant at M.A.C.H.S... garam garam hawla, allo n chanay ki tarkari accompanied with shaljam ka achar.. soft puris, followed by omellet \u0026 parathas.. finished off the round with tea, cold drinks and meethi lassi.. finger licking good..\ngreat ambience, pretty clean place, great family sit-in area.. a place to surely visit.. it\u0027s in the lane right across to Kabees..","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-08T18:19:54+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-09T18:24:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"1197210407","name":"Ambreen Siddiqi"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"718395717","name":"Bina Ali"},{"id":"1071403944","name":"Nazish Ahsan"},{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQ0MjI3MTY4Mg\u003d\u003d","before":"NTY0MDY5NzY0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"293026787415145","from":{"name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary","id":"100000093496883"},"message":"This is the kaybees close to shabbirabad","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-09T13:17:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293144107403413","from":{"name":"Sabza Aly Jiwani","id":"549791400"},"message":"When will DINING be correctly written;
