Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention. Our website is currently unavailable due to scheduled server maintenance (which is taking much longer than we expected this time round). A few fundamental changes are being made to the back-end to ensure a faster, more efficient, online customer experience. With regards to the missing truffles, it seems like the Butler\u0027s staff forgot to put them in along with your order. However, my service center has had a word with their wait staff, and I would like to apologize on both our behalves for this occurrence. However, they have assured my team that they will remember to send across extra truffles with your next order to make up for this one!
