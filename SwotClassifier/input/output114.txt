I asked for Faisal who normally serves us and serves us well but was informed he is busy and can\u0027t serve you, \"us kay paas time nahee heay\" the other server said, shocking. After thirty minutes my order was taken verbally and took another half in hour for my order to be completed as it was served in bits and pieces, Tea first then food later one dish came after ten-fifteen minutes after the whole order was completed. Their was a supervisor in white shalwar kameez but he seemed oblivious to the situation. We were served by three different servers and the last one seemed deaf and mute because he never responded to my request, the precious one admitted they were short of staff when I complained. Finally a bill was scribbled and shown to me on the back of a brown envelope but I asked for a proper bill that took 20 more minutes, the whole process of ordering, serving and billing should not take an hour here it took double of that time because no one bothered to come and ask us if we needed anything. In conclusion as a old and regular customer of Damascus I would like to ask the management of damascus, who I am aware is active on this group, HOW do u expect it is physically possible for 3-4 servers to serve more than a 100 ppl?? They cover both gents and family section, you desperately need to hire more staff and train them better. I have had great Arabic food, Khava, green etc from Damascus and the service was excellent a few years ago, but now sadly service standards have fallen immensely, to catch the attention of a server its takes 30 min, to get your order it takes as much time and their is soo much confusion the servers are running around helter/skelter but not able to take your order, finally you bill take 20-25, good god, damascus was a sheer joy in the yester years but today it was a sheer torture, after today I can never go again, I rather go to the place opposite which cares and respects its paying customers and provides good service not such a painful experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-26T21:46:14+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-30T07:47:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100004229319190","name":"Sidra Saboor"},{"id":"654805071","name":"Rifa Di"},{"id":"501970131","name":"Waris Shaikh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAxOTcwMTMx","before":"MTAwMDA0MjI5MzE5MTkw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"640190982698722","from":{"name":"Najia Ahmed","id":"819424477"},"message":"I am a daily visitor at Damascus .
