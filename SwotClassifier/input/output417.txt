Since I was a guest I can\u0027t rate it properly. But everything was just spot on\n\nLOVED the slider plaster. Easily the best in town. Simple meal. Satisfying and thu fries were not included - there were enough on the table to be shared.\n\nThe salad too (I forget the name) was just amazing. The pepperoni pizza with lots of rocket and Parmesan has improved immensely - Shaikh Fawad they took your suggestion and have greatly improved the marinera sauce.\n\nMy all time fav will remain the chocolate tart. It\u0027s rich, creamy velvety that coats your mouth from the inside (that makes me lick my own palatte) the crust is perfectly crumbly and firm thin but giving the perfect contrast. Served with the lightest whipped cream (proper not the yuck tetra pack gloop) uffffff.....

We were served complimentary shots of some milkshake drink before the meal was served, which was very sweet of them. I ordered a burger with Mushrooms and a lemon mint drink, and my friend ordered a burger too. I have forgotten wat burger it was. The service was quick since the place was almost empty during maghrib time. As you can see in the pics, the presentation is very bad. They literally put a teaspoon of coleslaw in the corner. The fries were undercooked (kacha taste). The bun was of low quality, very local. The beef pattie was soft but again it was undercooked and almost had no salt (pheeka). The mushrooms were stale. I pulled out one from the burger to see if it was really a mushroom and not celery. The food overall had a raw taste. The cheese cake and drinks were ok.

Stale tasting mushrooms like celery!! Well chef at Log Inn Lounge needs to answer this. They put the funny tasting mushrooms in there. I even asked my friend if they mentioned celery in the description of the burger on the menu card! They looked yellow and smelled weird. 3. I did not return the food coz I was exhausted at that time. Wanted to get back home asap and sleep. Complaining would have meant spending another 30 minutes there. I went back home and ate watever was in the fridge. 4.

I, along with a colleague went there for the reservations and woahh the management over there was very much concerned about the \"10% Service Charges\" as they kept on mentioning that I will have to pay 10% service charges on the bill since we are 15 people. I had no issues on service charges but did not like the way they kept on mentioning it so I had to say k \"Bhai Mil Jayein Gay Apko Don\u0027t worry\". Anyways, we went there at 6:00pm in the evening, ordered the food out of which 6 were steaks including Pepper Steak, 2 Arizona Fire Steak, Twin Steak, American something steak. Food was delivered \"Kiston Mein\" after 40 minutes. To our disappointment, all the steaks were served COLD and also they served Mexican Steak in Chicken instead of one Arizona Fire Steak. Had to return all the steaks and waited another 10 minutes for them to come back with the correct order. 4 Order were returned correctly but for the rest of 2 steaks (One of it was mine :() the waiter said that chef will have to make new steaks since they were medium rare and cant be cooked further so we will have to wait for another 20 to 25 minutes. This was the last nail in the coffin. I asked them to cancel my order and told them that you guys should not ask for service charges when you cant entertain your customers properly. You brought the food after 40 minutes, brought 1 wrong order, 6 cold steaks, made us wait further to get the food and now you are telling me that I have to wait another 20 minutes? Right after 2 minutes, waiter came back with a steak and told me that its on the house which I refused and told him that the free food tactic will not change our experience with your pathetic services. Rest of the people were done with their food by the time. Bill arrived and guess what.....THEY FELT NO SHAME IN PUTTING THE SERVICE CHARGES IN THE BILL. I have been to Zamzama\u0027s one and always appreciate their service but I must say that Atrium Mall\u0027s Arizona has shown me new horizons of pathetic services.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-07T14:57:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-08T10:40:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"672864677","name":"Aamir A.

It\u0027s a food industry - the number of customers dining there was just unbelievable and I am pretty sure none of them must have gone back unhappy. Service, quality, quantity and pricing - all get full marks.  Ribs, Afghani, Reshmi and Satay with 3 varieties of naan, raita, chutney, bbq sauce, satay sauce, juices, drinks and water and 5 people eating so much gosht and paying 600/- per head inclusive of over 10% paid as tip is great value for money in these days of so much mehangai.   They even allow smoking indoors which scores some extra marks for BBQ Tonight as far as I am concerned.  And a 20% discount if you pay with Silkbank\u0027s Platinum Card.  Eat Now - Get A Discount - Pay Later - What More Can One Ask For.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-07T01:20:14+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-08T10:27:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"625571272","name":"Fahad Hanif"},{"id":"1655946149","name":"Imtiaz Merchant"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"505751528","name":"Fatima Saleem"},{"id":"769030393","name":"Muhammad Danniyal Jafri"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"1627178378","name":"Zubair Aziz"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"100003784320529","name":"Shahzad Saeed"},{"id":"1013410116","name":"Lailumah Shah - Nasar"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"658405020","name":"Omair Omerson"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"},{"id":"100000986469861","name":"Rabiya Jawed"},{"id":"552274552","name":"Bushra Munir"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"509315108","name":"Daniyal Qazi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5MzE1MTA4","before":"Njk1Nzc2Mzkz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_581550678562753/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNTA5MzE1MTA4"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"581611515223336","from":{"name":"Sarah Arij","id":"100000349804754"},"message":"haha glad u enjoyed ur time thoroughly indoors.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-07T05:23:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"581632438554577","from":{"name":"Uzma B","id":"511882940"},"message":"Thankfully bbq has still maintained its standard of food n stuff!!

The only slight complaint would be that since the order took a hour to arrive it wasn\u0027t piping hot and with wings one ideally wants them to be piping hot.
