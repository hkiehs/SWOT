Writing a little rushed review for now. Will do a SWOT RATINGS in the evening.\n\nEverything from the service food quality serving size were excellent.\n\nTried the burrito bowl for the first time and loved it. Thank god the option was both beef and chicken I of course opted for beef. Wonderful \n\nAlso first time tried were the chicken lettuce wraps - what an amazing dish ( Snaps Har totally phytic acid free) \n\nThe burgers were the reason we went there and was so worth it. With amazing thick fresh fries. \n\nThe raspberry ice tea was refreshing but not very raspberrish.\n\nThe desserts - chocolate tart (always a must have) was as good as ever. Surprise was the Italian bread pudding......which was absolutely fantabulous, not the usual caramalized gloop available at majority of the places floating in a caramal sheera. \n\nThis was light and airy, still moist and gooey baked in a bed of apples. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream \n\nOnce again a bunch of happy campers came home from The Pantry","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-24T07:59:56+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-24T19:16:40+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"690005614","name":"Owais Asif"},{"id":"691430365","name":"Muhammad Ali Teli"},{"id":"734678626","name":"Rubaya Zia Khan"},{"id":"100001172477386","name":"Haaniya Saad"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"100002850760185","name":"Nayab Ali"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"1143951347","name":"Sabeen Rasool"},{"id":"512542175","name":"Nabiya Fahad Khan"},{"id":"724851212","name":"Mahvash Siddiqi"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"622624323","name":"Mansoor Teli"},{"id":"617715399","name":"Uzma Javeri"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE3NzE1Mzk5","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_623626511021836/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNjE3NzE1Mzk5"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"623628374354983","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"I have always had good experience there since the first visit also!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-24T08:09:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"623630001021487","from":{"name":"Aqsa Wahid","id":"1311642147"},"message":"Love their food, ambience and service.Burrito bowl is amazing.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-24T08:15:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"623633877687766","from":{"name":"Mahvash Siddiqi","id":"724851212"},"message":"My family loves the pantry.

A quaint little place tucked away in Khadda Market.  Called up a few minutes in advance for a table of 3, and the management was courteous enough to have a table ready. \n\nThe place has really nice ambiance, is tastefully done, plays good contemporary music, and has adequate lighting.  Just the perfect place for a quick casual meal.\n\nOrdered the Flame Grilled Chicken, and that was bloody delicious.  It ensured that the chicken\u0027s sacrifice was not in vain.  The chicken was super flavorful, and every little square inch of the chicken had its own distinct flavor.  The chicken was juicy, and it never went dry.  The meal certainly did justice to its nomenclature.  The chicken was served with assortments that complemented the meal, and a fresh, soft, and fluffy pita.\n\nAlso ordered the Lightweight Chicken Shawarma, and that seemed to be a disaster.  The chicken was bland, dry, and tasteless.  The only saving grace was the pita, and hummus.  I would personally avoid the Shawarma next time around.  \n\nDefinitely becoming a regular at Rowtisserie for its Flame Grilled Chicken.  Hoping that they row across the Mediterranean, introduce Gyros, and just nail the flavor!\n\nRow all the way.\n\nOverall Rating -- 7/10 (mainly because of the Flame Grilled Chicken)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-22T20:27:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-24T16:30:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"724148371","name":"Rabia Hai"},{"id":"1590802896","name":"Farri Khalid"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"},{"id":"100006519972294","name":"Ali Raza Q"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"797675206","name":"Javeria Usmani"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.
