bun kebobs a lot but admit to not really having them past years due to stomach problem risks. One of the best used to be at PIDC near the famous pan walla. When I was going to Govt Commerce in the 80\u0027s this was the place we\u0027d go to after school. They don\u0027t use a traditional bun but a bohri bread type bread and very nice spicy chutney and no onions or veggies. Incredible bun kebob that can only described as 10/10. I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s still there and if so whether same standard but worth trying and now that I mentioned it will probably go there again after many a year. Tipu Burger a joke, their chutney very \"peeka\" and no zing to the taste. Like eating plain bread. A friend once took me to a famous guy in Nazimabad called \"Bapu Burger\". I have to say that was amazing. Clean kiosk and incredible rush, maybe 30-40 cars around him. Although he has the shami kebobs his best bun kebob has a thin hunter beef-type patty which is incredible. Someone just opened a bun kebob place clean and hygienic looking next to Chase dept store in Clifton. He says he\u0027s from Nazimabad and it looks good.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-01T07:47:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"612528588798295","from":{"name":"DrSyed Farrukh Jamal","id":"749655321"},"message":"Theres one joint somewhere near FB area, rather a bakery called Manama...they serve good bun kababs..\nNasim Ahmed you are 100% right about Tipu!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-01T08:20:09+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"612533092131178","from":{"name":"Kulsoom Qutb","id":"100002056572978"},"message":"MASHALLAH BURGER at tariq road","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-01T08:37:51+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"612756228775531","from":{"name":"Aruna Dawani","id":"720217622"},"message":"Tipu burger has cole slaw/mayonnaise and ketchup in their bun kebabs!!!!!!!!!
