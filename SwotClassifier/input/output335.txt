As previously complained ^^. around Iftar lots of things were already finished, which is understandable, the workers have to open their fast as well, but no excuse for that later in the evening ... \n\nSometimes I got lucky and got warm, fresh food (mostly from the live counters), which was definitely on par. \n\nAbout the food, it was good, the spice was on point. The mutton Karhai, mutton \u0026 chicken sajji, and the fried fish were all excellent.\n\nOverall, I wasn\u0027t impressed, and at that price point (1200) , I would have much rather visited Kolachi. I give it a 6/10, and probably wouldn\u0027t visit again for their Iftar buffet, or recommend it..\n\nMaybe they had an off-day.

And we did! Anyone who was there tonight for iftari, I hope you enjoyed the \u0027loud noisy crazies\u0027 ka table this evening :D\nThis was one of those rare occasions where I actually looked forward to rousing myself from my Ramzan hibernation, and going out for iftari with some very close friends of mine. 2 of you were missed, you know who you are! Now, the first thing I noticed was Ramadan Kareem Mubarak k cardboard cutouts all over the ceiling. Oh, bhai, please confused NA HO! Ya toh say Ramzan Mubarak like a good little Pakistani, or Ramadan Kareem like the esteemed Arabs. Lekin please next year, stick to either one, k? Thenks.\n Moving on, the CHAIRS! I\u0027ve always had this problem with Zouk. Mai itni choti si nannhi si jaan, upar se pulling back those bhari bhari kursiyan. Lahoolllsss! The table was for 15 people, and the chairs were a bit too close together for my liking, but I was sitting with people I like, so that was fine. Since I was the first to arrive, I had some time on my hands. And I saw a politician sitting waayyy at the other end of the building, and quickly averted my eyes. Roza makrooh nahin karna tha mujh ko 7 bajay! \nOnce everyone arrived, and we could break our fasts, there was an assortment to choose from. I had no issues with the chicken vegetable rolls, fried fish (Or was it chicken?) pieces, and chicken wings, but this was my first iftari without pakoras. I know. I was all :O too! Ooo, and there was space arranged for offering prayers, so no dharnas at Zouk demanding justice, okay?\nMoving on to dinner, I don\u0027t know about you, but I usually just iftari, and then sehri. Lekin tonight I suppose batein kar kar k bhook bhi lag gayi. The food at Zouk has always been good, and tonight was no different. I don\u0027t remember the names, but I everything tasted just the way it was supposed to. Special mention goes out to the chili chicken, which was delicious, and even though the shrimp thermodore lacked the oomph it\u0027s supposed to have, it did NOT smell, so yaaayyy! \nAfter iftari, everyone gets a bit sluggish, so even though we had to ask 3 times for coffee and tea to be served, it wasn\u0027t an issue, as we understood the poor server\u0027s halat. Now, my only miffed moment was when I asked for coffee, and I was told, \u0027Madam, coffee available nahin hai, machine kaam nahin kar rahi\u0027 I was like, \u0027Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaattttttt the heebie jeebies?!\u0027 Anyway, I told them to take some hot water, put in 2.5 teaspoons of instant coffee, and bring me brown sugar and milk separately. Phir aya, \u0027Madam aaj brown sugar nahin hai\u0027. And that was just a total *facepalm* moment for me. My expression must\u0027ve literally been like this o.O At the end of the day, I finally got my coffee, (With Canderel, yuck) and it was strong, so I got my fix. \nIn conclusion, and this is what I wrote on the comment card, \u0027No coffee, HARAAAAAMMMMMM!!!!!\u0027, but other than that, it was an iftari worth eating, if only I\u0027d been in full form to do justice to the food, and the company was brilliant. We laughed so much my jaw hurt from laughing so much, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Yeeeaaahhh, I guess that\u0027s about it. If you read through this entire post and have gotten here, thank you for sticking it out, andIloveyoukthenksbai!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-01T21:12:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-03T00:01:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001663557079","name":"Fatima Haryani"},{"id":"100000961720252","name":"Nouman Soorty"},{"id":"892195391","name":"Tehreem Fatima"},{"id":"1626883423","name":"Fatema Murtaza Lacewala"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"676000707","name":"Tasneem Murtazaalibhai"},{"id":"504457451","name":"Shehna Mansoor Sheikh"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"543131941","name":"Morag Khan"},{"id":"100000919264743","name":"Yumna Siddiqua"},{"id":"1013410116","name":"Lailumah Shah - Nasar"},{"id":"603245271","name":"Mashaell Akhter Noman"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"650666717","name":"Bushra Mapara"},{"id":"595550053","name":"Saima Salim Mirza"},{"id":"761236254","name":"Zohaib Rehman"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1579891410","name":"Erum Siddiqui"},{"id":"100001729691191","name":"Aamir Je Awan Dxn"},{"id":"100001882596023","name":"Mansoor Zaheer"},{"id":"570735879","name":"Masuma Anjarwala"},{"id":"100000907377739","name":"Safa Salim Maniya"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwOTA3Mzc3NzM5","before":"MTAwMDAxNjYzNTU3MDc5"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_596523593732128/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dMTAwMDAwOTA3Mzc3NzM5"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"596524690398685","from":{"name":"Daniyal Qazi","id":"509315108"},"message":"hahahahahahahhaha LOL at laholllllls!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-01T21:15:32+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"596524843732003","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Go agay, there\u0027s also haraaaaammm :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-01T21:16:07+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"596529377064883","from":{"name":"Nabeed Tahir","id":"852830281"},"message":"NOOO COOFEEEEE ...
