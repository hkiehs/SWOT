Their food is just as great as I have always found it. Had the Honeyed Lotus stems and melting mushrooms for starters. Those mushrooms TRULY melt in your mouth and lotus stems fritters/ slices were to die for with the spicy honeyed sauce. Was a bit wary ordering a \"honeyed\" main course too but was pleasantly surprised that both tasted completely different and absolutely delicious. The honey chilli prawns with spinach (not soggy mashed-y one, but a slight twist to the regular way of serving spinach) and garlic rice was divine. Their Badam Sherbet was a bit too sweet for someone who likes a moderately sweet drink/ dish. For me it was heavenly. This place has never let me down.
