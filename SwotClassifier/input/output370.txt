After reading and hearing rather polarised opinions about MYOB, the wife and I decided that a tasting shall put many questions to rest and put the mind (and stomach) at ease. We ordered the Combo 2, which brings you the Half Pounder, Onion Rings, Belgian Fries and a Drink. Onion rings were out of stock, so we got the Mozzarella sticks instead, which is where things started to go wrong. The coating was fine, it was nice and somewhat crispy, but the mozzarella inside was rubber. Not cool. The Belgian Fries were fries alright, but we missed the whole Belgian point. They were regular fries, and fairly standard ones at that. But onto the main star of the evening, the famous half pounder. The intensity of the unwrapping of the burger was comparable to the unveiling of a new iPhone. The suspense rivalled that of any good episode of the Zee Horror Show (anyone still remember that?). And when the burger was finally revealed, the big, juicy looking patties, sandwiched in cheese and mayo looked very, very promising indeed. Could it be that we had finally met the burger that deserves to be united with man in holy matrimony? The answer was but a bite away. Now, at this point, I would love to say that with that first bite, the world slowed down, an orchestra struck up a slowly swelling concerto of violin notes and the gates of culinary heaven opened slowly. But none of this happened. Supreme disappointment reined. I took a second bite, convinced that my taste buds had lost all control of their senses. And then a third bite. And a fourth. Einstein once said that doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is stupidity - and it was. The glorious half pounder, the burger that promised so much, delivered so little. It was big and very very filling, I\u0027ll say that. But it lacked flavour, it lacked that special something that makes you say \u0027oh dear lord\u0027. It didn\u0027t give me the same kind of tingly feeling I had when I first tried Burger Shack or even the somewhat BurgerKingy feeling that I get when I have a double patty original from FatBurger. It was just another burger, and sadly, one that did not climb very high on my top ten burger list. I would say that Burger Shack, FatBurger and even Mr Burger are certainly better in terms of taste and flavour. The patty was very well cooked, nice and even, the burger was well assembled and well preserved in the packaging. All of this is great, but if it doesn\u0027t taste as good as it looks, its like getting into a Ferrari and finding out it runs on CNG.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-22T19:47:51+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-24T10:44:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1443166426","name":"Surayya Amin"},{"id":"509686069","name":"Hasaan Mubasher Sheikh"},{"id":"100001089240373","name":"Abdul Basit Sivany"},{"id":"540991978","name":"Anika Effendi Saqib"},{"id":"100000986469861","name":"Rabiya Jawed"},{"id":"100000907377739","name":"Safa Salim Maniya"},{"id":"508081630","name":"Maha Anwar"},{"id":"703935487","name":"Xoya Ahmed"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"553721274","name":"Taimoor Zubair"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"503116086","name":"Amina Tahir"},{"id":"537798684","name":"Abdul Basit Memon"},{"id":"531591653","name":"Marium Ahmed"},{"id":"565157664","name":"Sarah Farooq"},{"id":"503824462","name":"Sonia Murtaza"},{"id":"1248903988","name":"Amal Faisal Ashoor"},{"id":"100001306021747","name":"Tariq Ilyas"},{"id":"514292991","name":"Marium Hosein"},{"id":"539145384","name":"Saher Shaikh"},{"id":"500172130","name":"Agha Hamza Pathan"},{"id":"603103229","name":"Danish Munir"},{"id":"514605350","name":"Ruquia Jawed-Hammad"},{"id":"626411005","name":"Faisal Khalid"},{"id":"193200782","name":"Saad Omar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTkzMjAwNzgy","before":"MTQ0MzE2NjQyNg\u003d\u003d"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_590578494326638/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dMTkzMjAwNzgy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"590580024326485","from":{"name":"Mahad Mustafa","id":"805150435"},"message":"oho!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T19:52:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590582677659553","from":{"name":"Tatheer Naqvi","id":"517591959"},"message":"I\u0027m going completely out of the topic but awesomely written btw :p just sayin\u0027","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T19:57:59+0000","like_count":30,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590583530992801","from":{"name":"Bilal Alvi","id":"641495625"},"message":"Let me just say that this is by far the best \"bad review\" i\u0027ve ever read \u003dD","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T20:00:14+0000","like_count":31,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590584810992673","from":{"name":"Sohail Maskatiya","id":"738981577"},"message":"Very well written, though i had a pretty good experience with MYOB.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T20:02:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590584940992660","from":{"name":"Faizan Mukarram","id":"1023815310"},"message":"what an \"epic\" review..lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T20:02:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590585070992647","from":{"name":"Ali Jafri","id":"558240539"},"message":"i never was concerned about MYOB.....your review got me stuck to it....","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T20:03:00+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590586760992478","from":{"name":"Adeel Waqar Ali","id":"585858177"},"message":"Anazing review!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T20:07:33+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590588510992303","from":{"name":"Jamshed Azhar","id":"714505550"},"message":"I\u0027d stick my rather long neck out here and differ - only because we had MYOB today for the first time and maybe it was the hunger but the whole family loved the stuff - give it another shot  I say :) very well written review all the same","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T20:12:48+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590588984325589","from":{"name":"Faisal Raza","id":"100004934224675"},"message":"i like the ferrari part lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T20:13:56+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590589260992228","from":{"name":"Sumiaya Arif","id":"100000226962956"},"message":"Ferrari lolzz review well written","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T20:14:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590589577658863","from":{"name":"Rehmat Ebrahim","id":"719028214"},"message":"The Ferrari part is great.

Being a vegetarian most of my life, I usually avoided fast food and fried chicken, in leau of fresh salad and vegetables. I tried several restaurants but none were able to replicate that authentic western food feel with the garden aroma. \n\nI had decided since this morning that I\u0027d be trying something new instead of my usual pick (Golden Dragon, Food centre, Mr. Burger) etc. Then I found this group called San-which? which was a food restaurant. The food looked good enough in the pictures but I was still not sure. I posted for reviews here and seeing that this \"San-which\" was approved by our big boss Nezihe Hussain, I gave it a shot. I ordered the greek salad through Urbanite at 8:15 pm, I was given a call at 9:45 pm that the rider had the wrong address and will be at my place in 20 minutes. The rider reached at 10:15 pm, apologizing and compensating me with a delicious Ice cream by Lal\u0027s. A good start ;)\n\nThe packaging and the presentation was perfect! As soon as I opened it, I could smell that similar garden aroma fragrance that was sweet tomato\u0027s key point gainer. I immediately realized the search is over. I\u0027ve finally found the taste I had been looking for. Everything was perfect! The quantity, the quality, top class ingredients. It was just delicious. I could taste each and every ingredient that it consisted of, from the sun riped tomatoes to the black olives to the feta, that how different it was to the traditional stuff, how high quality it was compared to any other thing I have eaten recently, including subway or the traditional gyros.\n\nMy food experience of San-which: 9/10. I never give full marks because in my opinion there is always room for improvement, but this little outlet has just won my taste buds, and will surely be my go to place besides golden dragon from now ownwards.\n\nI usually never write such big reviews on food experiences unless its a bad one, or upload pictures of the food I am about to consume. Infact, I hate the habit.
