It was around 1:30 pm. There was a large party of about 10 or so people in a corner of the restaurant, the rest of the place was empty. Raheel  had called ahead to inquire if they would be able to accommodate 5 adults and 2 kids and had gotten a positive response. Raheel, my brother and mom were to follow, we had gone ahead because the kids were hungry. \nUpon entering when I told the waiter that my husband had just called minutes earlier about us being 5 adults and 2 kids, he argued that he had been told 2 adults and 2 kids. I told him that the conversation had taken place in front of me and I know Raheel said 5 adults and 2 kids. \nAnyway, after some argument he finally took us to a booth and I requested a high chair for Ali. The same gentleman replied that the high chair could not be placed there. Fair enough, since the booths are placed on a kind of raised platform, the chair wouldn\u0027t be stable. So, then I asked him to relocate us somewhere where I could have a high chair. \nAnd the attitude that had started to deteriorate slowly, just took a dive and he walked off making a face without saying a word. Now as a customer I would expect someone to tell me something like, alright if you could just wait here (at some table) while we make arrangements. Instead we were just wandering around the restaurant wondering what we were supposed to do or where we were supposed to go. I saw waiters joining tables and we waited there assuming that they were doing it for us. It took them a substantially long time to put two tables together. \nWhen that was finally done, I requested the same waiter to please bring water and an order of fries first as soon as they could because Ali was very hungry and that when the rest of our party joined, we would then order together. It seemed like I was talking to the wall because he was halfway turned away, wouldn\u0027t even face me while I was talking to him and the expression on his face was just indescribable. He had such contempt on his face, it felt like he was feeding some homeless person (ehsaan ker raha tha). Then a waiter came and poured water in the glasses. Even my bhabi felt there was something wrong because she said that the next time someone came she would ask them if there was a problem because they were all giving us attitude. \nThen another person came and said that they only had 2 high chairs and they were both occupied. Now I hear they have a seating of 250 there and just 2 high chairs? Anyway, that\u0027s when I called Raheel who told me to ask them to hold the fries because we couldn\u0027t eat there with Ali and no high chair. So I did. One of them was courteous enough to say that the fries were almost ready but I had to tell him that we wouldn\u0027t be able to stay because of the unavailability of the high chair. And this person says something about the high chair being wiped clean or something which I was unable to fully comprehend. So I told him that\u0027s not what the other waiter told me, i.e. I was told that both your high chairs are unavailable. At that, they all seemed to kind of look from one to the other. \nThen the first guy tells the other one to take the money for the water which we had not even drank. So I paid 104 for water which we did not touch and walked out because the staff had absolutely no interest in persuading us to stay. You couldn\u0027t pay me to go there again.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-20T11:05:52+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"382790691772087","from":{"name":"Naheed Moini","id":"1425503961"},"message":"Now that is really something absolutely UNCOOL...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First and foremost, the fact that she and her bhabi felt that they were being disrespected with attitude and rolling eyes is unacceptable. It is a good thing that I did not know that when I went to pick them up because things would have become quite ugly! Further, if you did not hear me properly on the phone, no problem. In a largely empty restaurant, just make the adjustment and ensure that your customers feel taken care of rather than the exact opposite. And after all that attitude, when the customer is unhappy enough to leave, to have the guts to charge for anything is beyond me. My ONLY and MISGUIDED reason for even thinking about Aylanto after our lousy last lunch was the fact that the young man who came to check on our meal implored me to give them another chance! Plus, even though I insisted repeatedly to the contrary, he did not charge me for a couple of items that I was not happy with so I felt morally obligated to go back because that was never my intent in giving them honest feedback and frankly, I was uncomfortable about the free food even though it really was BAD BAD BAD (see earlier review). As things stand now, NOBODY but NOBODY, disrespects my family and gets off the hook. I will accept no apology or explanation and will not set foot in that below standard establishment ever again. They should count themselves very fortunate that I did not react to their behaviour and am just making myself heard on this page.
