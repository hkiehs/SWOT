With the expectation bar at its peak after hearing and reading so much about it on SWOT and outside, I was a bit apprehensive while going. What if it doesn’t turn out as good? What if my grandiose expectations fall flat? Oh well. Nevermind, I reassured myself and our group of 10 with bachas in it went ahead. We reached well after 830pm thanks to the jam packed sea view road that tested both my patience and driving skills. Finally when we reached we were told by the courteous lady at the entrance that we’ll have to wait for anywhere between 30 to 40 minutes to get a table for 10. Though I was warned of the weekend rush that picks up after 830pm my own miscalculation prevented me from pre-booking. Thanks to Muneer Esmail and the ever courteous staff of Kolachi, we managed to get a table well before the time given. And what a lovely spot it was. I could’ve easily spent hours sitting up on the deck overlooking the sea and enjoying the lovely environs. Kolachi cleared its first test with full marks! \n\nThe gentleman who appeared to be the Manager helped us settle and ensured we were comfortable. Our group relied on me to order (knowing fully well that I am the worst at the job). However, thanks to my earlier post on SWOT, I had received some recommendations and decided to play safe. So my pick included Paneer Reshmi Handi, Peshawari Karhai (in Chicken as the group was not inclined towards red meat) and Kolachi Reshmi Kabab. As much as we wanted to try out starters, we chose not too as the popcorns at Cineplex right before the journey to Kolachi didn’t allow that. So we settled on the main course. For this trip only! \n\nBachas in our group are notorious for ordering fries wherever they go! They frown and fret and make a fuss if they don’t find their favorite starter. Fortunately Kolachi didn’t let us down there! Kids were happy with cheesy and Masala fries to start off their meal. For drinks, I went ahead with Muneer’s recommendation and ordered Blue Colada. Some in the group ordered Lemon Mint Glacier while the rest settled for soft drinks or fresh lime. \n\nFood at Kolachi came, saw and conquered! Literally! Paneer Reshmi Handi was well beyond our expectations. It was simply divine! I profusely thanked SWOTTIES who recommended it!! I wanted to devour more than my appetite allowed. And I did. Peshawari Karhai was well cooked and tasted heavenly. With roghni naan, the food was sheer delight. Reshmi Kababs were fresh and tender. They complemented well. \n\nI am forever thankful to Muneer for recommending Blue Colada! It was fantastic. I acted the bad one by not sharing it with anybody which I usually do. The evil me had it all and craved for more!! However I didn’t want to explode so resisted. There was no space left for even tea. So we got up after the lovely food and an excellent service. I must compliment the staff. I wonder how they remain so polite and attentive given the number of people frequenting the place and demanding personalized service! Hats off to the management of Kolachi. \n\nNeedless to say Kolachi is on my radar now and I’ll be visiting the place more often!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-16T06:26:33+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-16T19:42:33+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"688336352","name":"Abbas Farid"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI1OTY4OTUz","before":"NTI0NDc2NzM1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"413375985380224","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Yum!!
