Packed. And the same situation at Okra too. So, decided to go to Pantry as I have been hearing good things about it. They were able to seat us fortunately. Love how the place looks so bright during the day time. Since me and my friend were not very hungry, I ended up ordering, at the waiter\u0027s recommendation, a Chicken Acapulco sandwich while my friend ordered the Mushroom Mac and Cheese. I have never really like macaroni so the mac and cheese held no charm for me. I took a bite but as I said I have never been to keen on it, so for me it was quite meh. My guest was however pleased with her lunch. \n\nHaving said that, the sandwich very quite good. The bread is apparently baked in house and it is excellent. When ordering the sandwich, I was offered several choice of bread but I went with the plain one, which was excellent. Overall a good meal. Will probably go there again for dinner one of these days.\n\nLocation in the lane of Espresso Zamzama and Okra.\n\nExpect to pay about 1000-1500 a head.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-29T14:58:27+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-30T15:38:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1033177887","name":"Zainab Zeeshan Monnoo"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"622624323","name":"Mansoor Teli"},{"id":"100000434598020","name":"Sarah Atif"},{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"823205690","name":"Muhammad Umer Gill"},{"id":"690952546","name":"Shuja Muhammad"},{"id":"691430365","name":"Muhammad Ali Teli"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"1377186173","name":"Owais Mahmood"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"508776548","name":"Meher Saigol"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"1272243315","name":"Ambreen Shekhani"},{"id":"651643760","name":"Jasrah Mubarak"},{"id":"1471668943","name":"Aman Shaikh"},{"id":"805195531","name":"Amna Shah"},{"id":"100002154180249","name":"Afifa J Maniar"},{"id":"1277228905","name":"Rehan Ahmad Khan"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"100001773575512","name":"Little Chef"},{"id":"658210647","name":"Sania Saeed"},{"id":"724121365","name":"Rida Mansoor Teli"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4","before":"MTAzMzE3Nzg4Nw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"674220442629109","from":{"name":"Tehreem Fatima","id":"892195391"},"message":"u mean espresso zamzama! not shahbaz","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T15:04:09+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674220689295751","from":{"name":"Faisal Naseer","id":"780902784"},"message":"Yes I did Tehreem.
