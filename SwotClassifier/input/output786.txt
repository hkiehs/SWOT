I have tried clotted cream from a few other places and have been quite disappointed so it was nice to have clotted cream done right this time. \n\nI\u0027m not sure if the jam was home-made or bought from the market, nevertheless it wasn\u0027t bad. \n\nNow for the scones, the scones were a bit of a let down. Size wise and taste wise. They were small and when I say small I mean small, bite size. Also as much as I would like to, I would not dare use the words light, fluffy or feathery to describe these bad boys. Disappointing! \n\nPresentation: What was also disappointing was the presentation. Styrofoam cups to hold the jam and clotted cream. Over sized boxes to hold the scones which were displaced and scattered all over the place by the time I opened it. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I do not expect expensive packaging or containers but you can tell when someone has made the effort and it is always, always, always appreciated. \n\nI remember when I had ordered scones and clotted cream from another home-based baker, the scones had been individually packed and then placed neatly on top of a paper doily. The clotted cream and jam were sealed in containers but then presented in small baskets. \n\nNeedless to say presentation does make a difference.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-31T15:44:43+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-01T08:41:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"544811222","name":"Tehniat Aftab"},{"id":"575802952","name":"Ayesha Farooqi"},{"id":"501891633","name":"Komal Tauqeer"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"599290095","name":"Naureen Umer Lakhani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTk5MjkwMDk1","before":"NTQ0ODExMjIy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"419091721475317","from":{"name":"Rabia Shah","id":"679311166"},"message":"Omar a  well written review.
