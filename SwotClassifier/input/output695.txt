Just the right tenderness for the chicken fillet and the sauce was the perfect blend of salt and sour. The gratin potato is now better than that of Aylanto\u0027s. Friend had the spicy fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken, which according to her was probably one of the best she\u0027s ever had in town. She claims the sauce to be very close to that of Pasta Mania. The chicken cacciatore remains the most interesting dish on the menu and has maintained the standard as well. Just order a side of mashed potatoes with sour cream (which btw is divine!) to go with everything else that you order. All in all - a meal at 76 has always been perfectly satisfactory. Definitely the go-to place for good food.\nFor me personally though - love sitting in the atrium section with friends.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-06T09:07:21+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-08T12:14:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1292708984","name":"Arshnoor Moosa"},{"id":"514290400","name":"Hirah Sid"},{"id":"641324643","name":"Nadia Moqeet"},{"id":"628916560","name":"Maahin Naveed"},{"id":"514440277","name":"Máriá Shabbir Babrawala"},{"id":"896595117","name":"Noor Fareed"},{"id":"598110240","name":"Shumaila Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTk4MTEwMjQw","before":"NzcwMzU4MDY1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"469097536474735","from":{"name":"Maahin Naveed","id":"628916560"},"message":"I agree !!
