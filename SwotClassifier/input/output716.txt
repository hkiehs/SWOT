Tried some of the new menu and most of it was quite well received by the gang, especially the Chicken Teriyaki and Snapper. The Singaporean noodles are a good bet for someone who likes spicy food but it was a bit overwhelming for the young lady who I bullied into trying it! The pomegranate juice was also given high marks. I enjoyed the papaya salad and bbq wings too. Desserts were pretty close to the old menu and who can go wrong with molten lava cake \u0026 creme brulee!! \n\nHowever, since this was truly the first night for the new menu, and we polluted it with personal choices, we will have to give the full new menu a run when it is ready and that review will be more robust than this one. Always feels good to eat at a place where the staff is eager to please and for us, that was CBG again. Missed Ali Raj today and hope all is well with his family. Thank you Hussain for all the cooperation, attention to detial and care because I know its not just us who gets it!!

My husband had made the reservation well in advance and thus we were promptly taken care of as soon as we entered the restaurant. The staff was pleasant and courteous without appearing to be excessively concerned or fake. While we scanned the menu and discussed the various options we were served the complimentary bread basket along with seasoned olive oil and the herbed butter. Between the two of us we decided to order 2 appetizers and of course one main course each. So these are the things that we ordered: Mezze Platter, Grilled Tiger Paprika Prawns, Beef Medallion (for me) and Stuff Baked Chicken (for my husband).\n\nOn the whole we found the food to be excellent and the portions to be appropriate. All the dishes including the bread basket were of high standards with the exception of Mezze Platter which was average by the standard of everything else that was served. The Tabouleh was served without any bulgur wheat while both the Hummus and the Mutabel lacked a certain kick. Having said this, in line with the bread basket served to us earlier, the pita breads that came in the platter were perhaps the best that I have had in Karachi. Soft to the extent that they melted in the mouth while soaking in the flavors of the dips that the accompanied. The Paprika Prawns were juicy and succulent and were spiced to perfection. My husband truly enjoyed his chicken and particularly the creamy sauce. For me the star of the evening was the Beef Medallion which I had requested to be medium well and indeed it was medium well. I had also asked our waiter Amjad to replace the mash with steamed and sautéed vegetables but he was kind enough bring both and I am glad that he did because even though I normally do not each mash potatoes because I find them to be exceedingly heavy, I enjoyed this one as it was light and airy.\n\nAfter we got done with our main courses, we asked for the desert menu and just as we started scanning the menu Mr. Sam GM from Olivetto’s team stepped in and told us that he had already taken care of it and had arranged for a Chocolate Molten Lava on the house in honor of our anniversary. While we waited for it we got a chance to chat with the gentleman himself and enjoyed our brief conversation with him as we touched upon the different ingredients used and the special techniques deployed by the chefs there. The cake was definitely worth the wait as with the first plunge of the spoon the velvety and glossy lava oozed out from the centre of the cake. What I personally also enjoyed was that instead of the usual vanilla ice cream, they served the cake with a toffee/caramel ice cream which was great complement to the chocolate cake.\nAll in all it was a great culinary experience and everything from the food to the service was of high standards. Olivetto is definitely a place that I would like to visit and explore further. Thank you Sam GM for taking great care of us :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-14T16:20:36+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-15T07:27:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002605916001","name":"Sadaf Munir"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"},{"id":"512864890","name":"Scidra Usman"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"690005614","name":"Owais Asif"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"640287493","name":"Mariam Ahmed"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"500616229","name":"Sama Aman"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"676040882","name":"Saniya Shadab"},{"id":"631611761","name":"Adnan Zafar"},{"id":"504592087","name":"Kanwal Anes Ahmed"},{"id":"538934895","name":"Amad Ul Hasan Siddiqui"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTM4OTM0ODk1","before":"MTAwMDAyNjA1OTE2MDAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"460422507342238","from":{"name":"Afroza Bhamani","id":"846664538"},"message":"What a lovely write up!!!
