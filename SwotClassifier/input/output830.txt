You’ll get that cheesecake bite and then immediately the Oreo taste. Such a great combination. The rich \u0026 creamy texture of Philadelphia cream cheese makes it even more sinfully delicious. \n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/sinfulbitess","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-09T14:50:31+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-11T18:53:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100001115968985","name":"H Usman Ghani"},{"id":"589563741","name":"M Junaid Chinoy"},{"id":"680185313","name":"Khalid Ishaq"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Have had Fuchsia couple of times in the past week followed by the ever tantalising and unparallelled chicken biryani from none other than Cafe Students. Today it was Chinese. Frequent diners at Golden Dragon have spoken really high about this place so I decided to give in \u0026 let G.D play with my taste buds. Today was the second time I ordered in from there. I didnot find the deals attractive since I\u0027m not a fan of atleast 2 out of the 4 dishes they offer in those deals. So, I selected \u0026 ordered 3 dishes from their menu online: The ever famous American Chopsuey, Kung Pao Chicken (on basis of strong recommendations by family \u0026 friends alike) along with a Thai item, Chicken in Coconut Red Curry. Food was delivered exactly in the one hour time that was communicated to me. The rider (unlike the ones at most of the other food delivery restaurants) had no problem locating my address. As per my instructions, the rider did not ring the door bell, instead called on the mobile number fed in the restaurant\u0027s computer system. (This was worth mentioning because I\u0027ve experienced some major mishaps with riders from Dominos, Mc Donalds, Subway etc. ringing my doorbell \u0026 calling my name inspite of having the order takers make special note to NOT ring the doorbell, as it would awake my entire family in the middle of the night, \u0026 instead to call on my cell once they are at my doorstep; but all efforts in vain!)\n\n Anyways, food as expected, was delivered piping hot, in the most convenient packaging. It looked \u0026 tasted scrumptuous! The quantity was sufficient for 5 people. Family loved every bite of it \u0026 endlessly sang praises! Beginning from the order taker whose cooperative behavior \u0026 courtesy makes u feel cared for, to the chefs \u0026 service staff in charge, till the rider who assures ur delivered the ordered items in perfect timing \u0026 perfect condition,, Golden Dragon, ur doing a WOW job! When I\u0027m baffled with what to order, you come in at the right time and make life easier! Got to tell u, u ROCK!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-10T21:02:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-11T15:46:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000522564819","name":"Imran Bahadur"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"849555062","name":"Hira Aslam"},{"id":"1258402550","name":"Ateeka Ovais"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQ1MzkwMTMxMw\u003d\u003d","before":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"411511492233340","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Thanks for the lovely review and kind words.
