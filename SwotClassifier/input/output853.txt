Once the food did reach my doorstep, an hour and thirty minutes had gone by; the delivery person did apologize though and blamed the tardiness on his vehicle\u0027s breakdown.\n\nMy order consisted of one serving of each of the following: Crispy beef, egg fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, chicken chow mein and Thai chicken in lemon and lime. Hands down, the crispy beef stole the evening; the crispiness and tanginess was just right! Thai chicken and lemon and lime was good too, but there were more whole dried red chillies in it than chunks of chicken. The sweet and sour chicken was too sweet and wasn\u0027t touched by anyone at the table after one spoonful. Lastly, the egg fried rice and chicken chow mein were both bland and left a lot to be desired. I do wish the rice had some flavor to it.\n\nThe second time around, the delivery of the food was spot on. By popular demand, crispy beef was ordered again with chicken in garlic sauce . Egg fried rice was made at home. Crispy beef was the best and most liked dish again. Chicken in garlic sauce was tasteless. It seemed watered down.\n\nTheir Thai menu looks amazing, but I wish that more authentic Thai dishes like Pad kee mao and Pad khing sod were present. Well, no matter the disappointments, I\u0027ll definitely be ordering the crispy beef again.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-14T21:23:06+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-16T21:41:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"570766058","name":"Ayesha Saeed"},{"id":"603490700","name":"Mariam Bilgrami"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA4ODc0NDI2NQ\u003d\u003d","before":"Nzc3NjQ3ODAy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"398017586916064","from":{"name":"Umme Hamdani","id":"592813967"},"message":"One thing that I forgot to mention is that its price and quantity is great.
