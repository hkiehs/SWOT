There was a lot of apprehension surrounding the choice as they are not easily pleased when it comes to trying out a new eatery. So it was a source of relief and delight when they returned smiling and raving about the food and service of CBG.\nThey started off with the Soup of the Day which I believe was lentil soup, and for entrees they ordered Grilled Chicken with Mushroom Sauce and Stir fried Oyster Beef. According to them everything was as close to perfection as possible. The soup was delectable, the chicken was juicy and the beef had the right flavour. Thank you CBG for making their special day even more special. Good food, good ambience and good service equals a well spent evening for them :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-17T18:53:35+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-18T11:46:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002704212056","name":"Sunny Hazara"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"720381480","name":"Sidra Aiman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzIwMzgxNDgw","before":"MTAwMDAyNzA0MjEyMDU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"413921475325675","from":{"name":"Ghausia Rashid Salam","id":"716901426"},"message":"Dude.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-17T19:32:13+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"413944825323340","from":{"name":"Sairah Khalid","id":"544715226"},"message":"Hussain Tariq","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-17T20:59:54+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"414137625304060","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Aamna Saiyid - Thank you!

One has to be realistic when the response is a professional and appropriate one with no misrepresentation or bias towards any individual or group seeking a reservation. No space is a good problem to have and speaks well of that establishment. Advance planning for such places is a necessary evil. If you cannot do that, then you should not make plans for that restaurant and certainly avoid negative comments because they could not accommodate your reservation. Just FYI, I feel that way about Okra and therefore rarely think about it as an option for us to dine out. However, that does not take away from the fact that it is a very  respected and highly complimented eatery! I freely admit that our plans rarely happen that far in advance, nor am I willing to change our generally spontaneous style of eating out.  Therefore I just eliminate the option but with no malice directed towards the restaurant. Not fair to criticize them for telling the truth and being successful!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-16T14:42:21+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi","type":"user","offset":22,"length":13},{"id":"14902996","name":"Jamsheer Avari","type":"user","offset":40,"length":14}]},{"id":"413491118702044","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"killing them is a little harsh - and i can understand the frustrations - but they cant throw out one customer to accommodate another","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-16T14:46:44+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"413543585363464","from":{"name":"Tabish R.
