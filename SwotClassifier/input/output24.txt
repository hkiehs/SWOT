Anyways didn\u0027t create a fuss as it was lunch time so I had that only. The soup was greasy \u0026 lacked taste. The bread given along was rock solid toasted. Over all 5 out of 10.\n\nAfter lunch we decided to give Ci Gusta a try. After trying out almost every flavor I settled for Vanilla Caramel \u0026 Mascarpone. They don’t even have cones yet :/. All the flavors that I tried flavors just ok and there wasn\u0027t much variety either.  Though the quality of gelato was good so were the flavors I tried. A little too sweet but OK. Rs.350 for a large cup which I think is just a teeny little too much. Over all experience 7 out of 10.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-27T11:43:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-27T11:43:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000579313166","name":"Xobi Shah"},{"id":"100000527119269","name":"Shazia Rasheed"},{"id":"834415649","name":"Kanwal Faisal Baloch"},{"id":"520882045","name":"Ghulam Ali"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"542255506","name":"Amjad Rafiq"},{"id":"571261882","name":"Priyanka Suchdev"},{"id":"1023611913","name":"Nimra Inam Baloch"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAyMzYxMTkxMw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc5MzEzMTY2"}}},"picture":"http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/1489263_10201138600013389_2038227057_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10201138600013389\u0026set\u003dpcb.673074999410320\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d2","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_672610466123440","from":{"name":"Ateeb Akber","id":"649725153"},"message":"what is the difference between cappuccino, latte, mocha,  espresso?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-26T19:35:38+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-27T11:22:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"100000641944194","name":"Saleha Shahab"},{"id":"100000114960083","name":"Irfan Lala"},{"id":"100001803662044","name":"Zarmeen Jameel"},{"id":"1643239504","name":"Junaid Hasnain"},{"id":"617290572","name":"Ayesha Faizi"},{"id":"859695450","name":"Ali Imran"},{"id":"100003747168232","name":"Zoha Salim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAzNzQ3MTY4MjMy","before":"ODA3Njc1Njk2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"672612122789941","from":{"name":"Zoha Salim","id":"100003747168232"},"message":"Cappuccino can be cold or hot!

My wife and I ordered the VANILLA bread pudding but weren\u0027t given the bill. Upon inquiring for the bill, the owner(Jamal) rudely snapped that it would be given to us with the order. After a 5-10 minute wait, the order arrived. Lo and behold, it was a chocolate brownie! Upon inquiry, we were told, as if it was our first time eating bread pudding, that it only came in chocolate flavour! I told him that it was written on the menu board but instead of acquiescence, he told us that we should have asked him what was the flavour where as the menu clearly states vanilla. Anyway, I ordered an Oreo cheesecake which was Rs 20 cheaper, according to the owner. However it does not stop there; the owner was not giving me the 20 Rs!!
