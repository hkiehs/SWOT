I ordered a little snog natural flavour yogurt and what I received was totally unacceptable. The salesman gave me a cup which had been reused. I noticed some strawberry colored yogurt on the edges and the cup was dirty. When I informed the salesman about this he said this had been returned by a customer and insisting it was alright giving me a used cup. Further more he stated that it\u0027s snogs policy not to waste cups. This really annoyed me as a result, I returned the cup!  I am really disappointed with snog this is not the first time this has happened.

A freaking Baby cockroach ( Picture could have been better, but they snatched it frm me as soon as they saw me taking a pic)... The response to this horrendous mistake was even more baffling.. I was simply just handed over another cup, and told I can have 297gm of my choice again, since that is the weight of the Frozen baby roach yoghurt I just handed in... I asked him to hand me back my money (we bought Rs. 900 worth), he handed me Rs 150 saying the rest is still good so no return... I was amazed and baffled at their calmness of the matter, as if its a regular occurrence.. I asked him to take the container out so no one else consumes it since its contaminated, they didn\u0027t even flinch.. I wonder how many people must have consumed this roach infested yoghurt last night... Absolutely shameful standards of food hygiene and customer service... I literally stopped Families and Kids from taking the yoghurt as long as I could cause they weren\u0027t doing anything about it..
