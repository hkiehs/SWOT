We booked a week in advance and then yesterday we were told that we have to choose out of one of the 3 set menus and dietary requirements and have to intimate the restaurant before noon for the dinner which we did.  With so many NAKHRAS by the restaurant management, we expected top quality food and service.  They messed up with our request for the menus we emailed to them and the dietary requirements were not even considered.  If they didn\u0027t want to check our email reply which was sent to them at least 12 hours before their deadline then why the hell did they have so many requirements???

We ordered the Mezzah Platter, and as usual 5 star to the platter which was awesome, feta and  olives along with humous my favourite on it! As it was just two of us, by the time we were done with bread and platter, we felt stuffed! because both were soo good! Anyhow, i had already ordered Chicken Roulade. and despite being full, i still managed to eat 70% of it because it was veryyyyyy good! and the frnd ordered Braised Lamb--again a large serving however she thought the taste was slightly bland. But i would also discount that we had quite heavily satiated our taste buds with the starters!\n\nAnd well, this did not leave any place for desserts! But overall as usual after 18months, the Okra experience ws still the same! so three cheers for them!\n\nNight time shift was my initiation to Port Gran with 14 other odd frnds and family frm abroad. and what a place it is!!! amazing! makes me feel even more proud of karachi..:):) And i am already eagerly looking forward to the expansion and addition to the place. There was a live Sindhi Musical cultural performance while we were there, which i thought was a great idea, kept the public very entertained, depicted the culture of Sindh and should be continued as well. For dinner, we landed at Chairman Mao, (being their regular customer in my karachi-days for delivery). Ordred Pizza, and well how much i am a fan of Mao, the pizza tasted very mediocre. We ordered Chicken Tikka pizza, and the pizza had too much of chaat masala! whch kind of lowered the taste! so ws slightly disappointed. Then went for Chickn Manchurian and Chicken in Oyester Sauce, both were fine too, but lacked the \u0027kick\u0027 that i used to get after having a Mao-meal! they tasted like a very ordinary meal from a desi-chinese place. Either Mao\u0027s port grand branch hs different recipe, or the quality has just deteriorated slightly.\n\nBut the port Grand experience was marvellous! cant wait to be back next year with even better PG!\n\nTommorow\u0027s lunch-- Olivetto!!

My first time there, I was completely taken in by the beautiful decor. dark wooden interior, fresh white flowers, and a very spacious and grand setting. Thank u Afroze Khan for being such a sweet and gracious host! U add so much to the overall Olivetto experience :) \nSeafood chowder was yum with nice chunks of seafood, others had tomato basil \u0026 cream of mushroom soup - both passed with flying colors. the mezzeh platter was terrific, the hummus, the tabouleh - WOW. breaded calamari, as Afroze said, is definitely the best in town. Ceaser salad was great too. Sole Meditteranean was a treat to my soul. just a tad bit salty otherwise a perfect 10/10. Chicken stuffed with Feta was delicious in its creamy goodness. Chicken in mushroom sauce was super tasty, with a tinge of garlic in every bite. Creme brule had great consistency. The star of the night was the indulgent bread pudding generously topped with sticky toffee sauce. This delicious dessert was an on the house treat and came with a customized birthday greeting - really made me feel special! Thanks again Afroze for your hospitality!
