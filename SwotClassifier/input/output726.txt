Thai Fried Rice - the taste is somewhat like the normal Chinese Fried Rice that we have here in Khi.

Super comfy and cozy; somewhere you\u0027d love to curl up with a book and coffee. Food had good and average both. Starters were tangy chicken Salas (really nice!) And fristo bisto the seafood platter (disappointingly oily). Among entrees of mushroom chicken risotto, Mongolian chicken and Japanese chicken, the risotto stood out with a true Mediterranean touch. Nothing wrong with the other two but not something you\u0027ll get.excited about. Drinks were great. Suggestion to include tea varieties (especially Turkish) in the menu since one needs something to cut through the heavy food in the end.
