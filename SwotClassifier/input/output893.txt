I will divide my review in two parts, this one being about the food.\nWe were three people, my friends ordered Chilliz Chicken Pasta \u0026 chicken shashlik with rice. I ordered the Grilled Chilliz Beef Burger. \nThe food came in the promised 25 minutes, and the first bite made it clear that everything was freshly prepared. I tried the chicken pasta and the shashlik with rice, along with my burger of course :)\nThe pasta was tossed in a tangy spicy tomato sauce and herbs, topped with grilled chicken breast. After 3 bites it became a bit too spicy though, because of the crushed chilies in the sauce. But my friend enjoyed it and it was her order so the customer was happy.\nThe chicken shashlik was served on skewers, well cooked and juicy. The herbed rice were really nice, though a bit less in quantity. The sweet \u0026 spicy sauce that was served with it was a hit. Really delicious.\nBut the star of the day was the Grilled Chilliz Beef Burger! A huge burger, with a thick juicy beef patty, topped with sautéed mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, fresh crispy lettuce and creamy mayo. The patty was well grilled, and oozing with flavours. The fries were fresh as well as the cole slaw served with it. I am in absolute food heaven right now!\nThe service was great, the manager, Mr. Obaid, served us and the staff was very courteous and attentive. Met the co-owner, Mr. Rizwan, a very nice gentleman.  He offered us complimentary drinks, tropical drinks that they will be launching from Friday. Since we were to full already, the 3 of us just tried one drink. Named the daredevil, it was a combination of blueberries, peaches \u0026 redbull, and tasted great. Very refreshing.\nOverall, I we had a fabulous time at Grilled Chilliz. The food is great, the prices are great, very good value for money. I am definitely going back there again, and soon!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-23T11:33:44+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-24T07:07:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003034652779","name":"Saher Mukhtar"},{"id":"543405800","name":"Tahir Wahid"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"1652751344","name":"Rameen Alvi"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA4ODc0NDI2NQ\u003d\u003d","before":"MTAwMDAzMDM0NjUyNzc5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"384687361582420","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Nice review....","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-23T12:11:09+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"384697631581393","from":{"name":"Mohammed Rizwan","id":"1542669392"},"message":"Thanks Bilal.

The seating is comfortable, the temperature settings were great. The music selection was bad though. Had to hear tonight Im F***ing you 3 times before the sound system was turned off because there was a tv play shooting to be done there.\nAah the shooting the only kala daagh on an otherwise wonderful experience.\nWhen we arrived, the female actress was getting her makeup done on a corner table. Then she moved to the centre of the dining hall, to an electric point, where the stylist straightened her hair right in the middle of the restaurant. She was sitting at a table where people eat food, and god only knows how many hair she must have shed there. I pointed this out to the co-owner Mr. Rizwan, who very politely heard me out and agreed with me that it shouldnt have been done but since the lady was halfway done with her hair, it was pointless to stop her then.\nAnd if this wasnt enough, in walked 2 actors, one of them particularly hairy, and they then changed clothes right there in one corner of the dining hall! I had bent down my head to bite into a yummy burger and when I looked up, right in front I saw a half naked hairy man prancing about. Not a very good sight for ones appetite, let me tell you that.\nAnd then the female actress proceeded to spread her clothes on 3 tables while deciding which outfit to wear. We were half expecting her to change there too, but thankfully she had the decency to go change in the rest room upstairs. Which the men should have done too. \nThe restaurant management shouldnt have allowed this behavior. I understand that Grilled Chilliz is a new place and they might not have had an experience like this before, but some of these media people can be really obnoxious. They should have had the basic etiquette to show respect to people dining there.\nThis post is not a complaint or a bad remark against the GC management, rather a rant against obnoxious media people.\nGrilled Chilliz, you guys are fabulous! \u003c3","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-23T12:01:33+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-23T23:02:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"570766058","name":"Ayesha Saeed"},{"id":"543405800","name":"Tahir Wahid"},{"id":"512386146","name":"Bilal Hassan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"503738833","name":"Zehra Khan"},{"id":"1473431885","name":"Syed Aamir Bukhari"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjY4OTYxNDAz","before":"NTcwNzY2MDU4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"384685621582594","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"Oh boy.....
