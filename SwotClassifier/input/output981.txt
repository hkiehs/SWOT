After having a lovely lunch was invited for dinner there too.  Olivetto seems to be the favorite these days as both at lunch and dinner it was a full house.  The smoked turkey salad with pasta was absolutely fabulous.  Also ordered the feta cheese salad and the mezzeh.  Both really delicious.  Thin crust smoked chicken pizza was my main course but also share the spicy  hummour which was outstanding.  Also tried the creme brûlée for the first time a there which was served with a freshly baked cinnamon cookie.  One of the finest creme brûlée I\u0027ve had in recent times. On my special request the dessert chef of Olivetto made a really bitter chocolate lava which went very well with vanilla ice cream.  Friends with me were very happy with their main courses, pasta with spinach, jumbo tiger prawns, Moroccan chicken and baked stuffed chicken.  Yer another great experience in fine dining. Highly recommended for great food and ambience.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-29T17:59:16+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-29T20:11:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100002594564883","name":"Tania Ali Raza"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100000238377520","name":"Zeeba Ansar"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE3NzYwNjU4","before":"NzkyNDcwMTcw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"286457221405435","from":{"name":"Farah S.
