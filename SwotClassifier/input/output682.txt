The server came back to me saying it wasn\u0027t anything but a really dried rice grain. I told her that was certainly not the case. She did take my serving back and came with another one, same meal. We ordered lava cake and it was really good. To my surprise, I was amazed at the management team that no one said anything about the meal and instead they just sat there. If nothing they felt was wrong, my meal should\u0027ve have been replaced in the first place. I later in the eve went to Gon Pacci again to have the lava cake packed to have it at home and the cake had no chocolate and was all dry. Disappointed. Good will gestures, courtesy and an apology if anything goes wrong can make you visit again no matter how hopeless. If anything goes wrong the least any manager or owner can do- walking up the customer and talk which goes on to show it is in their knowledge.
