We ordered Hummus (not good, it just didn\u0027t taste like Hummus) and Peri bites (spicy, but yum) the chicken steak meal and a quarter chicken meal. I tried the boneless chicken steak meal yesterday and I think it might become my new favourite there. It tastes exactly like the quarter chicken, minus the bones, win win! The food overall was decent, but the service was truly appalling. The servers were distracted and slow (even though the restaurant wasn\u0027t full) and when they made mistakes they were unapologetic. That really put me off!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-11T06:07:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-11T06:07:25+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"61308574","name":"Owais Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjEzMDg1NzQ\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_376958599021963","from":{"name":"Saba Tariq Hassan","id":"511664792"},"message":"has anyone tried the lettuce wraps at ginsoy?
