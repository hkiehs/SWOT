Most of the food was home cooked and the event manager was her mother/my sister. Since it\u0027s December we decided to do a winter and Christmas theme. Of red and white. With a Christmas tree all decked up and stockings for goodie bags. Lots of tinsel fairy lights and colorful baubles.\n\nThe two items we did get from outside were \n\n1) dark chocolate fudge cake with chocolate ganache (all are sick of the fondant cakes - no offence to anyone) and it was done by our fav caker - Uzma Saeed of Goodsies Cupcakes {the patron cake saint for SWOT}. The cake was adorned with Ariana\u0027s favourite things made out of fondant....mermaids, makeup and jewellery!!!!!! [Ariana had asked for spiders and cockroaches too but we the adults decided she was being funny - we hope]. The cake was a 5 pound rectangular mass of deliciousness. It was not too high - the party was for three year olds. And we hate food being wasted. So small neat squares. Which many of the tiny tots had seconds and even thirds. As always the cake was a huge hit.\n\n2) next Basma and I wanted something from our childhood too. So we got gol guppas daahi puris and kebab rolls from Adib\u0027s Silver Spoon - the Original One - wow what a spectacular addition that was especially for the mommies who came with their babies. The fresh tangy water, the sweet flavors of the yogurt with the special masala sprinkled over it. Yum yum yum.....I don\u0027t think I got my fill of it. \n\nGod bless my little one and may she have many many more lovely days as she had this one.
