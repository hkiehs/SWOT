Kamal, we\u0027ve investigated at our end and there seems to be a bit of a misunderstanding on your part. Your driver came to us with the menu with items ticked on it. On seeing the chicken meals, our order taker asked the driver to give her your number so she can ask about the sidelines as they were not mentioned i.e not ticked. Your driver didn\u0027t feel comfortable in sharing your number and did not give the number out, but said just give chicken only. After a while he came again to buy the sidelines. Your driver paid for the sidelines the second time and the initial order we did not charge the sidelines to you so clearly you didn\u0027t order the sidelines to begin with.\nThe order-taker also pointed this out to your driver that he should have given her the number when she asked him and she would have asked you directly in the first place to avoid this back and forth. We\u0027re still sorry as your lunch experience was ruined but the oversight was at your end not ours. Our restaurant also confirms that there wasn\u0027t any call placed at the restaurant from you. Perhaps you called the UAN which may have been received by a different rep who may have apologized as any complain is handled with a note of apology to begin with. We conclude that its wrong to imply that we are at fault, there was an oversight yes, but not from our end.

Sad only 4 places are open: babuji\u0027s, gardenia, city bistro and aylanto bistro. \n\nOpted for city bistro. We initially very hesitant to try but: WOW!!!! We ordered crispy chicken in tandoori sauce, pan fried fish and a chicken burger. Very flavourful. Crispy chicken was made crispy by cooking filet  pure american style recipe of hash browns. Wow! Simply elegant. Cant think of any other word. Pan fried fish in creamy lemon butter sauce: soooooooo beautiful it . A good big fillet in subtle flavours. Both dishes were served with herbed mashed potatoes had flawless texture and flavour.  My chicken burger was a patty in fresh bread. Nothing exotic but since i was hesitant i opted for a  safe bet. It was good. Nothing delightful but definitely pleasant.  Remarkable how all meats were perfectly moist and nothing felt rich. Obverall a great meal. 3 ppl, redemption 1s. 300. After redemption net bill was Rs. 1260. A good meal on a not hefty dent to a pocket. I loved it.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-02T10:26:04+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-02T16:18:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE3NzYwNjU4","before":"MTA1MzgyODYyNw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"270128649704959","from":{"name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary","id":"100000093496883"},"message":"Ambreen Haider there is also oishi sushi maos pizzeria and ghaffar","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-02T11:34:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"686115120","name":"Ambreen Haider","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]},{"id":"270128723038285","from":{"name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary","id":"100000093496883"},"message":"thats not counting mr.cod and optp","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-02T11:34:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"270142496370241","from":{"name":"Misbah Omar","id":"509911471"},"message":"i think she meant there were only 4 places open for lunch when she went!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-02T12:20:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"270192746365216","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"Thank you Misbah Omar yes Ryeaan Anwar Chaudhary i do know what all is open :). for lunch it was just these 4.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-02T14:25:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"509911471","name":"Misbah Omar","type":"user","offset":10,"length":11},{"id":"100000093496883","name":"Ryeaan Anwar Chaudhary","type":"user","offset":26,"length":22}]},{"id":"270242879693536","from":{"name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary","id":"100000093496883"},"message":"i have not visited port grand for lunch utter appologies","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-02T16:18:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjcwMjQyODc5NjkzNTM2","before":"MjcwMTI4NjQ5NzA0OTU5"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_270186269699197","from":{"name":"Cheena Chhapra","id":"100000528920624"},"type":"photo","created_time":"2011-12-02T14:10:17+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-02T15:55:41+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"270187763032381","from":{"name":"Rabiya Syed","id":"1453901313"},"message":"Which flavour is this dress??
