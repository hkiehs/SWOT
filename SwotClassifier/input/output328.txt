The dough was as uncooked as shown here. We returned it and the waiter with complete loyalty to the employer first refused but upon our insistence agreed for another go at it. He returned 20 min later with same pizzas, this time over cooked. We were starving by then but still we refused to accept it. But when I hinted that the servers were becoming a little cranky, I asked for the manager pretty harshly. He came out in no time and when we explained him the whole story he told us actually it\u0027s the result of new ovens they have got which are supposed to cook pizzas early. I told him to get me those traditional ones with normal cooking temperatures because I will never accept uncooked half baked dough in the name of pizza. 30 min later we got fresh yummy pizza perfectly cooked.

It was around 11pm so was quiet which was perfect as we wanted to be away from the maddening crowd. We ordered the Mushroon Chicken Waffles \u0026 Chicken Pizza. The Waffles were  a pleasant surprise and enjoyed the combination. Loved the sweet potato fries which I have never had in Pakistan. Have had it abroad. Chicken Pizza was light and crispy and just perfect for a late snack.... the dip with the waffles was finger licking also. Service was efficient except the server was confused about the dessert options so we sent him back to confirm after which we ordered the Chocolate Tart which was delicious as per my friends...I skipped the dessert :) ( I know, a sin but dessert is the original sin for me :)). Overall experience was 8/10 considering in the first visit it was 5 and that too because the owner had dropped by and got our feedback very keenly.
