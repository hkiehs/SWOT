It was my wife, my brother in law, a friend and me. To start off, I would like to acknowledge the most hospitable person Ive met in my life, Mr. Najam Quddusi. Sir, it was a pleasure meeting you and would like to thank you for your great company. Getting down to the business, my wife ordered her all time favorite dish, Fettuccini Alfredo letting Mr. Quddusi know about her specific taste and likes about the dish. My brother in law ordered the Pepper Steak and I ordered the much commendable Burger From Hell. The Fettuccini was exactly as my wife had asked for and she enjoyed it to the last bit. It was cheesy, creamy and to add to the taste, it had the most wonderful strong aromatic garlic taste as asked for. The portion was too much for my wife and I was truly happy about the serving size. My brother in law enjoyed his Pepper Steak so much so that he did not even once bothered asking if we would like to try out his dish. He just enjoyed the meal as if he had been starving for days. As for my Burger From Hell, sir, to tell you the truth it was one hell of a burger. The portion was exactly as I always wish for it to be; FULFILLING. It certainly did fulfill my craving and appetite. Though the burger was amazing and I really enjoyed it, I must say it certainly was NOT FROM THE HELL I BELONG TO. :P \nWith all due respect sir, I do not have anything negative to say about your burger. It definitely was delicious and had the most amazing flavors combined with the best cheese and your spices. I enjoyed and cherished each and every single bite but its just that my taste buds are used to having more spices and it aint your fault. We had a wonderful experience over all and we would rate an 8.5/10. I would personally recommend Log Inn Lounge for a good hefty moresome meal. Sir, you would definitely be seeing more of us inshallah. Thank you for the wonderful evening that we had. \u003d)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-11T22:06:20+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-12T08:15:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003756103781","name":"Asif Jamil Ansari"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"611720320","name":"Quratulaien Tanveer"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"530180577","name":"Zahra Kamal"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"559845057","name":"Tabinda Salman"},{"id":"100000198281068","name":"Sana Sabi"},{"id":"626091116","name":"Mahwish Ejaz"},{"id":"736055502","name":"Erum Tariq"},{"id":"575820034","name":"Maheen Kamran"},{"id":"764425006","name":"Alisa Zulfiqar Zuberi"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"},{"id":"566660881","name":"Khurram A Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTY2NjYwODgx","before":"MTAwMDAzNzU2MTAzNzgx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"471605726223916","from":{"name":"Tabinda Salman","id":"559845057"},"message":"Najam Quddusi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-12T05:39:52+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"471612289556593","from":{"name":"Sameer Beg","id":"583446948"},"message":"wowoa!!!!
