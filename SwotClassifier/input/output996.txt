However just one thing...i think TUC\u0027s not quite geared for takeaways yet as far as coffee is concerned cos although the coffee tasted great the cup lid did not sit too well which meant i managed to spill some the mninute i stepped down to go to my car. Also didnt have a steam/sip perforation which is probably why the lid kept slipping off. Also this kind of packing meant u cldnt have the coffee on the go and wld have to sit down, take the lid off and take dainty sips without any danger of spills (ha!). So just something to keep in mind if u want to cater to the morning office going lot.
