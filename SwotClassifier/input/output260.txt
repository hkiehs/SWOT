Since i just visited PapaRoti lately, i\u0027d compare the 2 obv since they\u0027re in competition. MammaRoti was all empty at 9pm. Ordered a kadak Chai combo with Caramel topping for Rs. 380 (got the same thing for Rs.435 at PapaRoti) The tea was nothing to write home about, its obv from the pic, it was exactly like ghar ki chai, this is only what bothered me regarding its cost (PapaRoti not just had that creamy \u0027wilayati\u0027 chai but also had a presentable menu, ambiance and ofcourse the branding even on their saucers etc. The bun was \u0027almost the same but PapaRoti wins its for me since it did not crumble the way this bun did while slicing\u0027,though it tasted almost the same. it was fresh and good but smaller than PapaRoti\u0027s Bun. The topping was a local caramel one gets in pudding sachets. All in one a good experience, the staff was really courteous, but for me, its PapaRoti over MammaRoti cz of the tea,bun, ambiance everything. Please note: MammaRoti\u0027s prices are INCLUSIVE of tax whereas    PapaRoti\u0027s are EXClUSIVE of tax, hence pricing wise, MammaRoti wins!

In 1800 rupees all 6 of us had so much food and then there was enough left for one more person..\n\nHighlight of the food were prawns and batair.. one of the chicken dish was like chicken paneer handi it was excellent too..\n\nOverall taste wise it was a 7/10 but if you need something fast i really mean FAST its 10/10.. \n\nTip: We felt its better to get the take away than eating over there..

Fat burger, had it a long time back but I remember the beef patty was perfect. However not value for money.\n\n3rd. The burger shack, had it today, full house and original double patty.
