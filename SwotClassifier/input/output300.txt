It\u0027s adjacent to HLS a little farther away downhill. The interior is almost like Arizona + roasters. We went on chaand raat and were the only people sitting there, we were 8 people. Ordered dynamite prawns( which were exactly like the ones at gun smoke) pretty good . The calamari platter, it had fried and grilled, that too was okay. The jalapeño cheese balls, which has less jalapeño and more cheese so lets just call them cheese balls. 3 pizzas as the main course, chicken peri peri, asparagus and feta cheese and chicken jalapeño, all were good!  We also ordered 3 chipotle steaks(2 beef obe chicken) which were apparently the best out of all the dishes. The peri peri sandwich, which was a chicken burger(yes a burger) it was alright, not too amazing. The best thing we had were the sauces they gave with every dish, they charge for extra sauces we didnt know that and kept ordering away. For dessert we ordered the 4 tier chocolate cake, in my view this was nothing compared to espresso or nandos chocolate cake. a chocolate brownie with icecream, which was good and we got a complimentary creme brûlée(thank god). Whoever ate it said it was good. All in all I think it was a good 7/10 in terms of food. 10/10 in terms of sauces. It was about 2000 per person including the drinks which I think led me to conclude that it is an overpriced version of Arizona and roasters!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-12T04:57:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-12T04:57:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"500405954","name":"Ayub Khuhro"},{"id":"546505351","name":"Tabraiz Marri"},{"id":"100006344564497","name":"Tuba Aisha"},{"id":"100000416623123","name":"Imran Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNDE2NjIzMTIz","before":"NTAwNDA1OTU0"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_601690873215400","from":{"name":"Sohaib Tariq","id":"501672203"},"message":"Need ideas for a nice place for lunch.
