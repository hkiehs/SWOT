or so i have heard/read from this very group.\ni had been dreaming it for WEEEEEEEEEEEEKS and last night was finally the night i would be sampling and hopefully savouring the specialities on offer :o)\n\nwe were a group of four adults and two and then a third young adult who were beyond famished. i suggested we take the five persons plus another three persons deals since a single five-person deal was declared insufficient. during those crucial thirty-to-sixty seconds, opinions changed and on the \"majority\" of one young adult, we had to settle for The New York Pizza :o{\nmy every attempt and hope of tasting the newest oriental fan-following cuisine was smashed, squashed and buried into the tiniest corner of the ground!\n\nso the order was placed for one and a half-pizza - spilt over three toppings - \u0027cheese pizza\u0027, \u0027beef pepperoni\u0027 and their recently introduced \u0027chicken rustica\u0027. a side order of \u0027cheesy potato skins\u0027 was ordered along with the two one and a half litres soft drink bottles.\n\nthe food arrived within the committed time of three-quarters of an hour and was piping hot! we  were so beyond famished that we just sat down and were ready to eat out of the boxes!! my eyes popped out after seeing the size of the pizza. a whole 21\" - the size of a television screen!!\n\ni first sampled the \u0027cheese\u0027 slice as it would turn too rubbery after getting cold. there was a great deal of the tomato/pizza sauce under a thin sheet of cheese that was not even mozzarella! could have passed off as a home-made grilled cheese sandwich. STRIKE ONE!\n\nonto my order of topping - \u0027pepperoni beef\u0027 with mushrooms, olives and onions. the dough was soooooo smothered with the same pizza sauce that it almost covered the crust as well! the pepperoni slices were farther away than near and so one mostly had to chow down the dough and sauce! STRIKE TWO!!\n\n\u0027chicken rustica\u0027 was no better than pizza one and two. or maybe i had had a great serving of dough and sauce with very little meat that this topping was just the same. STRIKE THREE!\n\nto make the experience even better, the soft drinks were delivered at the free-will of the restaurant inspite of placing our choices. a bottle of seven-up and a diet pepsi were handed over by the rider. the seven-up was accepted while we asked the rider to exchange the \u0027diet\u0027 with a \u0027regular\u0027 bottle of pepsi from the store across the road.\n\nconsidering the size of the pizza itself, a larger quantity of toppings is greatly desired. there is only so much of pizza sauce you can cover the pizza with!\nand for the price we had to pay, we could have easily sat at a restaurant and enjoyed a two-course meal instead of a single!\n\nAsim Mohammad Ali and Qamarunnisa Asim, i will be ordering next week even if it just for ONE! :O)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-20T17:06:58+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-21T14:03:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA3NzQ4MDkz","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"414994265218396","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Sairah Khalid:It would be a pleasure to serve you!!!\u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-20T19:30:32+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"544715226","name":"Sairah Khalid","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"414995751884914","from":{"name":"Sairah Khalid","id":"544715226"},"message":"thank you soooooo much, Qamarunnisa. \nyour ramadhan deal has evoked a new dimension of HOPE! only wish there was a meat alternative to chicken.\njuly 28th is when i should be ordering :o)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-20T19:36:16+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa","type":"user","offset":24,"length":11}]},{"id":"415183525199470","from":{"name":"Uzma Javeri","id":"617715399"},"message":"That was a v painful eve ,was so looking forward to Golden Dragon , it was my very own young adult who squished our taste buds :( Next time young adult will be not consulted what to order for dinner :) come over Sairah Khalid we will order for 3 people ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-21T07:14:03+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"544715226","name":"Sairah Khalid","type":"user","offset":212,"length":13}]},{"id":"415247828526373","from":{"name":"Sairah Khalid","id":"544715226"},"message":"\"painful evening\"? were we THAAATTTTT BAAAAADDD a company for you, Uzma Javeri :o|\n\nmoreover, i did not want names taken but you decided to spill the cat out of the bag as usual. oh well, even if it was your own daughter who made us succumb to her choice. at least now i know, that is one pizza place i will never be ordering from!\ni have posted my complaint on their facebook page. let us see if and when they respond. otherwise, cheap and desi \u0027milano\u0027 pizzas are a sure-shot for me everytime :oD\n\nthank you for the golden dragon invitation. i have already set a date with Golden Dragon Chinese Cuisine that day and will be ordering the new ramadhan deal - on my own!! :oD","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-21T11:38:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"617715399","name":"Uzma Javeri","type":"user","offset":67,"length":11},{"id":"329131543795899","name":"Golden Dragon Chinese Cuisine","type":"page","offset":575,"length":29}]},{"id":"415295755188247","from":{"name":"Uzma Javeri","id":"617715399"},"message":"Painful eve , as regarding to the knee !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-21T14:03:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDE1Mjk1NzU1MTg4MjQ3","before":"NDE0OTk0MjY1MjE4Mzk2"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_415289271855562","from":{"name":"Khalid Ishaq","id":"680185313"},"message":"Ramadan Mubarak swotties!!\nNeed to know what sehri options we have this Ramadan?all of boat basin and burns road wud be open till sehri I guess??","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-21T13:44:31+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-21T13:44:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"585371256","name":"Muzammil Naeem"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"NTg1MzcxMjU2"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_415246358526520","from":{"name":"Marylou Andrew","id":"692481536"},"message":"Great for sehri, iftari or just for snacking.","type":"photo","created_time":"2012-07-21T11:31:36+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-21T13:32:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"692795582","name":"Mamun M.
