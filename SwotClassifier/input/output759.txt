Took my parents, as this was our only restaurant Iftar together as a whole family,  naturally I wanted it to be special. Though there wasn’t any hesitation in my decision for choosing café blue ginger I was nervous about the talking-up I did to my parents about it. The anxiety of not getting the consistency of our last experience at CBG and having to eat my own words was a constant source of worry in the back of my head. And even though the budget friendly nature of the Iftar -buffet and dinner could justify a very average dining experience, this however is no average Joe’s…. CBG is a top notch culinary destination, not because it wasn’t exactly consistent but because it was even better than the last time!!! The buffet was even more flavorful yet balanced, the entrees were cooked to perfection, and the desserts were spot on even though their pastry chef was out on an emergency… yet the institutionalization of their preparation wouldn’t have had me any the wiser in the consistency of their end product, in fact the substitute was probably showing off, cause I got a lot of extra caramel sauce on the side of my already delicious bread pudding. \nThe service was prompt and the team was on top of their game!!! I never had a sense of emptiness at the buffet, and all service was on cue! Whether it was a drink or tea, or a request to reheating the tea or for an extra bottle of water, the clearing away of our used plates and cutlery, or me asking for some cinnamon bark to chew down my sugar headache, the level of service could be described in only two words, fast and professional.\nMy parents were extremely happy with the unique buffet choices, especially the even more delicious wings, AMAZING mini-burgers, and ofcourse Dahi phulkiyas, and the fantastic chutneys. \nWith such a motivated team, food quality, and affordability- Watch out! CBG will be the restaurant of this decade.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-13T21:16:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-13T21:57:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"680185313","name":"Khalid Ishaq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjgwMTg1MzEz","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"423901084327714","from":{"name":"Shaikh Fawad","id":"694238742"},"message":"thank u Hussain Tariq for making this very family Iftar so very special : )","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-13T21:17:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423902170994272","from":{"name":"Shaikh Fawad","id":"694238742"},"message":"and CBG staff, thank u for the wonderful service, keep up the gud work : )))))))))))","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-13T21:20:48+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423913984326424","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Shaikh Fawad Thanks Bro!!
