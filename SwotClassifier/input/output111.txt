Only at the time they present the bill, they look at you with yearning eyes, as if they expect a wholesome amount, which one cant blame them for in this day and age of galloping inflation. Their is and will always be some disparity between the wages restaurant staff earns and what is actually paid to them, good establishments are judicious in their approach and pass on 100% of tip collected amount to their service staff + kitchen staff too as they are part of the team.

Kept the temperature at medium welldone. This steak I had today at Monte Cristo just renewed my love for succulent beef fillets. Nothing seemed to be out of order. Everything done to perfection. The 2nd entre was Pan grilled snapper and boy they did it real good. Soft, chunky and grilled with care.
