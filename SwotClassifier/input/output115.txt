Its a neatly done place with a 65 seater restaurant, with 25 seats on the ground floor and 45 on the first floor. As it was a Sunday their was a long line of ppl waiting to be seated,my ordered was punched in by the Cashier himself, it was 930 pm and he stated it would be ready in 30 min, he noted my name and cell no and txted me before the appointed time, quite efficient.Had order the Chicken corn soup,Chicken Mushroom and Young corn curry,Chicken with lots of chilies and Chicken Fried Rice. The ordered was nicely packed and one could easily lift the cardboard boxes out of the bag as they had boxes, the food was piping out, the soup was fresh and tasty and quite rich. The curries had good flavor and I personally like the Chicken Mushroom and young corn more, Chicken fried rice was steamed well and had a nice aroma, quality of rice and ingredients were good. I had heard mixed reviews of Ginosoy and was apprehensive but the food is good and they have won me over hands down, also very economical, meal for 4 persons is around 2k that is 500 per head, and one can choose btwn large and single serving, to caterer to every type of preference. I will definitely try Ginsoy again as its relatively peaceful at Lunch.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-28T21:40:32+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-29T06:05:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1064185636","name":"Ramsha Abid"},{"id":"730910580","name":"Maira Samir"},{"id":"621305514","name":"Aniqa Imran"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"688321217","name":"Cyra Akhtar"},{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"100000999733392","name":"Hadi Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwOTk5NzMzMzky","before":"MTA2NDE4NTYzNg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"641432949241192","from":{"name":"Umair Tahir","id":"591470264"},"message":"Their quality is goin down day by day.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-29T04:21:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"641452432572577","from":{"name":"Kulsum Wasty","id":"553305273"},"message":"My first experience with Ginsoy was quite average.

An incident happened with me today only. I bought the spicy double Mc. Crispy large deal from Mc Donalds drive thru, phase 2 on Thursday. I had 500rp so I asked the guy before ordering about the exact price of the deal, didn\u0027t want to fall short on cash. He said 800rp. I was like excuse me?! It was somewhere between 380 and 450 a week ago. I asked him to show me a menu sheet, a request that he avoided by saying that he wasnt sure and that he\u0027ll confirm the price from the computer when I\u0027ll place the order. He said ke it is 630. Had I not raised my voice, he would have totally scammed me, I paid 630 (after borrowing from a friend) because I thought ke why would he lie. Now the twist is that I got the same deal for 389rp tonight from the sea view branch. So honesty, is a rare commodity.
