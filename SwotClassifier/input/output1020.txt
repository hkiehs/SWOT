{"datums":[{"id":"165861103465048_271631632887994","from":{"name":"Bilal Hassan","id":"512386146"},"message":"After all the hype for the Upper Crust I decided to pay it a visit tonight I\u0027ll start off with the pro\u0027s first , the Belgian Chocolate Froyo was awesome and completely lived upto my expectations and the owner of the place was a really nice and friendly guy who made sure we got a place at the cafe. Now I\u0027ll come down to the con\u0027s , I was thoroughly disappointed in fact even embarrassed when the waiter at the cafe said that they were outta Froyo (both flavours) and all he could get me was one large cup of chocolate Froyo (We were 5 people we ended up sharing it yes thats pretty sad in itself ) , the part that was disappointing was that it was just 10 pm on a weekend night in Karachi people usually go out to a cafe at that time for dessert and when you end up coming out empty handed its the worst feeling ever. Secondly the flavours for the Froyo were pretty limited Chocolate and Mixed Fruit respectively I think there should be more flavours. We thought of opting for some other desserts then but when we went to check out the dessert window there wasn\u0027t much to choose from. I didn\u0027t see any of the delicious looking cakes or cupcakes that are posted on the official Upper Crust page anywhere in the cafe. We ended up going to the Hotspot instead and were thoroughly satisfied like always . I am definitely willing to give the place another shot since its a relatively new place and with a really enthusiastic owner it definitely does have potential to improve.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-04T19:33:23+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-07T12:33:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002605916001","name":"Sadaf Munir"},{"id":"603490700","name":"Mariam Bilgrami"},{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njc3Mjk1NTYz","before":"MTAwMDAyNjA1OTE2MDAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"271636166220874","from":{"name":"Maleeha Jawaid","id":"785615314"},"message":"Bilal you\u0027re baackkk","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-04T19:43:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"271641302887027","from":{"name":"Bilal Hassan","id":"512386146"},"message":"Yayyy I be back yo","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-04T19:45:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"271653646219126","from":{"name":"De Joe","id":"597535350"},"message":"This was our 15th day, in business.

Also, let me make it clear that I don\u0027t know any of the people involved nor have I been to Cafe 76. Personally, if I have a problem with the food being served to me at a restaurant, I would call over the manager or someone to let them know immediately and give them a chance to fix it... and would not wait for the comment card to be given. That way, if I was unsatisfied with the response, then I could say that there was no satisfactory management response after they were given an opportunity to fix things. Also, if I did own a restaurant, even if I did not appreciate the method or timing of the customer complaint, I would take notice since where there is smoke, there is fire. There may be an underlying agenda, but surely there has to be some issue ... small or not ... that exists and bears investigation. I think both sides could do things better and that SWOT is not about blame or mud slinging but it is for all of us to share experiences ... whether positive or negative ... for the benefit of everyone who reads this page.
