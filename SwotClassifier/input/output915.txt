Nobody makes good cookies in Karachi.\"  \n\nHav Joe caught my frustrations and asked if I was willing to wait a few months to try out something he\u0027d been trying to \"whip up\".  I humbly obliged- but was sceptical.   \n\nYesterday morning I ordered in, and was told the cookies were available.  When the box arrived-  three North American raised Medical Student\u0027s- Ahsan Rasheed, Farhan Tariq, and Salman Ahmed were ready to dive in. \n\nI bit into a soft, GOOEY, tender, and absolutely scrumptious morsel of heaven. I looked to my right and my friend, with crumbs on his face just smiled.  Meanwhile the other proclaimed- \"This is so good, I wish I had milk.\"\n\nThank you Upper Crust.  You\u0027ve made a man miss home just a tiny bit less.","type":"photo","created_time":"2012-05-11T06:29:10+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-12T15:35:12+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"539325181","name":"Sehrish Rizvi"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"643405172","name":"Sarah Ashraf"},{"id":"508588993","name":"Saroasha Eng"},{"id":"100003048636530","name":"Sami Baba"},{"id":"574028031","name":"Shiraz Qureshi"},{"id":"567197680","name":"Seema Mustafa"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA1MzgyODYyNw\u003d\u003d","before":"NjI1OTY4OTUz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"376968992354257","from":{"name":"Danial Rizvi","id":"726690443"},"message":"FINALLYYYYYYY","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-11T06:30:50+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"376971892353967","from":{"name":"De Joe","id":"597535350"},"message":"Thankz both u and danial a.
