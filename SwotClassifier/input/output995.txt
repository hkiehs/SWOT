They shldve served croutons with it too I feel tomato soup is just not complete without croutons. For the main course I opted for the Mediterranean chicken and was pleased with it (as is the case with most things I\u0027ve ever ordered there). Two huge fillets with plenty of spicy sauce to season it and many veggies. The au gratin unfortunately seems to keep shrinking in all restaurants but otherwise it was a great meal.
