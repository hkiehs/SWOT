Placed an order for 3 chicken ones, one plain, one with fries and the last thier new addition which is the garlic mayo Shawarma. Was initially given a delivery time for an hour but instead was delivered in a mind bobbling 2 hours.\nSo here are the flavor reviews\n\n*Garlic mayo: First bite inn it was quite creamy and nice, but too much black pepper for my taste and leaves a pepperish after taste. So it\u0027s good for people who like that. It was also a bit on the oily side.\n\n*The one with fries: Tasted pretty good. Very close to the ones back in Jeddah. \n\n*The plain one: YUMM. My favorite just chicken and sauce. Loved it the most. The closest one to the ones in the Middle East.\n\nDrawbacks: Was delivered cold had to microwave it, would suggest them to start a proper delivery if they decide to continue delivering. Also they should be sure on thier delivery timing as I dont mind waiting when I\u0027m giving a specific time but then the delays become annoying esp when one has mice running around in thier bellies.\n\nWould advice to go and enjoy it thier rather then ordering as there is a huge quality and taste bump.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-07T16:34:18+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-09T17:36:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1079532434","name":"Anisa Fadoo"},{"id":"501516047","name":"Zubair Farooq Dadi"},{"id":"100003533323814","name":"Sarah Muhammad"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"1385439948","name":"Danesh F.Khambatta"},{"id":"1118291942","name":"Umair Yaqoob"},{"id":"100000679437817","name":"Yasir Hameed"},{"id":"539697815","name":"Sherbaz Khan"},{"id":"8000747","name":"Ayesha Mohammed"},{"id":"1666329533","name":"Sarah Talha Farooqui"},{"id":"560960287","name":"Muhammad Gulzaib Ali Khan"},{"id":"617851264","name":"Qaisar Imtiaz Pirzada"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE3ODUxMjY0","before":"MTA3OTUzMjQzNA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"615359198515234","from":{"name":"Muhammad Gulzaib Ali Khan","id":"560960287"},"message":"how much for 1 shawarma?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T16:54:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615360571848430","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"150","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T16:59:13+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615364868514667","from":{"name":"Fiza Shabir","id":"1519835339"},"message":"Very economical , missing khi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T17:06:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615370175180803","from":{"name":"Muhammad Gulzaib Ali Khan","id":"560960287"},"message":"Not bad, i think they have just started so the delivery time must be under consideration.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T17:11:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615371545180666","from":{"name":"Oraiba Ezza","id":"618536135"},"message":"Where is it located","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T17:15:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615372141847273","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Parking lot of aghas.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T17:17:42+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615388161845671","from":{"name":"Waqas Tariq","id":"1088744265"},"message":"Phone number?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T18:06:48+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615400481844439","from":{"name":"Yasir Hameed","id":"100000679437817"},"message":"location?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T18:43:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615400561844431","from":{"name":"Yasir Hameed","id":"100000679437817"},"message":"M Babar Saeed","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T18:43:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"594039575","name":"M Babar Saeed","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"615409058510248","from":{"name":"Danesh F.Khambatta","id":"1385439948"},"message":"Mice running in the belly lolz...wonder if its got anything to  do with belly dancers !
