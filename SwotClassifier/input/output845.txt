NQ ingeniously devised a method to send over the food to KDA1...no complaints and timely delivery with hot food that was packed well. The Chicken Wings we so far the largest I have had here and I love wings in general so am very content with them. The Big Log beef patty had the correct amount of fat and was cooked to perfection. The salt beef in the sandwich was reminiscent of what I have had abroad and I added some grain mustard to give it a kick. Overall, Log Inn...great experience...and I generally call for food at home so I look forward to having it again. Unfortunately I didn\u0027t get to try the Kit-Kat shake as it apparently isn\u0027t a deliverable item.

Aman Virji gave us some excellent suggestions and was a great conversationalist. My friends all enjoyed the food and the environment. As for my experience, what can I say... I started off with the Seafood Trio and it was beautiful to look at and tasted just as good. The beef steak with chocolate balsamic reduction (I think it was called) was ridiculously good. I know some people see chocolate on steak and want to run away, but believe me if you haven\u0027t had it, go try it. The meat was cooked to perfection, perfect pink inside, soft and tender. Then the sauce, you won\u0027t understand until you taste it yourself. Even my friends were skeptical and when they tasted it they were shocked. It was like an explosion of flavor in my mouth and it continued with every chew. Layers upon layers of flavor it won\u0027t stop until you swallow. Then repeat the explosion with your next bite. I have to say by far that was the best steak I\u0027ve had in Karachi. That dish itself made my day. I\u0027m not sure what everyone else ordered but I know that they all liked what they had. For dessert we had molten lava cake and bread and butter pudding which weren\u0027t that amazing, but after the steak I didn\u0027t care lol. Thank you for helping us out Aman, it was truly a memorable lunch.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-20T12:43:03+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-20T17:08:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"786945014","name":"Samia Chundrigar"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"713861964","name":"Ahmad Nasir"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"24806592","name":"Dushka Riaz"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjQ4MDY1OTI\u003d","before":"Nzg2OTQ1MDE0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"401009336616889","from":{"name":"Samar Husain","id":"780381887"},"message":"Told You!!!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T12:56:33+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401106379940518","from":{"name":"Fahad Ahmad","id":"2720923"},"message":"Yes you did lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T16:59:35+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401110166606806","from":{"name":"Aman Virji","id":"797300590"},"message":"Glad to have you buddy....any time","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T17:08:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDAxMTEwMTY2NjA2ODA2","before":"NDAxMDA5MzM2NjE2ODg5"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_400987076619115","from":{"name":"Roomana Nasir","id":"529620428"},"message":"Lunch at Olivetto...

After being more than highly disappointed in the food at Baan Thai and Royal Elephant(at P.C), a friend \u0026 I decided to dine at Fuchsia for lunch today. My previous post on SWOT was about recommendations so as to make the dining experience worthwhile. A thanks goes out to all of you for taking out the time \u0026 putting in efforts (in the form of comments on that post) to provide recommendations \u0026 assist me in making valuable selections from the menu at the aforementioned restaurant.\n\nAt the entrance, we were given a warm welcome by the smiling staff who upon checking with our preference, lead us to our table on the ground floor, in the non-smoking area. Since it was a weekday, not too many diners had crowded the floor. Unlike many people out there, I like to eat at peace \u0026 do not prefer over crowded \u0026/or noisy eateries. After finding ourselves comfortably seated at a corner table, our order for appetizers, main course \u0026 beverages was taken by a cooperative \u0026 friendly waiter. We ordered the Creamy Coconut Soup with straw mushroom \u0026 lime leaf. An assortment of add-on spices and sauces were served to spice it up according to our taste. For main course we ordered  Red Snapper with chilli tamarind oyster sauce \u0026 Red Curry Chicken with bamboo shoots and sweet basil. While we were enjoying the flavour packed soup, a group of 4 kittie party aunties arrived \u0026 were seated on the table for 8, next to our\u0027s. They hadn\u0027t even properly greeted eachother when the rat race of fashion \u0026 who-spent-how-much-on-which-nail-salon-this-week gossip began. Their gossip or the topic of discussion was none of my business ofcourse, had they not turned their get together into a fashion expenditure war when one of the wannabe girl-aunty started to boast \u0027n\u0027 brag soooo loudly that I had to request the staff to move us elsewhere \u0026 escape from that material-war in process before their remaining guests arrived. Yes I was expecting atleast a few ounces of speaking etiquettes \u0026 decent body language from them.\n In no time, we were shifted in the smoking area upstairs, since the stuck-up group had the entire restaurant involuntarily all ears to them. The staff didnot become annoyed with my request \u0026 infact, very happily served our meal at the new table. Our main course was served in a matter of only ten to fifteen minutes of placing the order.\n\nThe  red curry (with  rice) was divine, flavoursome, and wow! However, the fish failed to impress us. It was too stiff (not crisp), lacked freshness, was dry to the core \u0026 not actually something I would order next time or recommend to anyone. I didnot ask for a replacement or complain about it because I  tried it for the first time at this restaurant \u0026 felt maybe it was meant to look \u0026 taste like it did. When offered to fill out the comment card, I did provide a written honest feedback  about the fish not to be at par with my expectations/ liking. I felt that would suffice, along with complementing on the things I liked about Fuchsia.\n\nRestaurant  ambience was pleasant, staff were clad in smart,  clean uniforms, were very attentive \u0026 alert to the needs of diners \u0026 order timeliness was observed to be quite impressive!\n\nOverall a great experience! I look forward to visiting Fuchsia again to devour in the various other specialities of the \u0027loved\u0027 place.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-19T16:28:49+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-20T13:10:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzkyNDcwMTcw","before":"NjI1OTY4OTUz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"400766493307840","from":{"name":"Rabiya Syed","id":"1453901313"},"message":"You should have requested a replacement for the fish  immediately.Its normally very succulent,crisp on outside but really soft inside and its sauce is absolutely delicious!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-19T23:51:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400856599965496","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"Fuschia is one of my favouritist places ever!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T03:52:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400948083289681","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"@Rabiya Syed I thot of doing that first, then I thot shayad aisi hi hoti hogi, so didn\u0027t bother","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T09:36:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400948269956329","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"@Charmaine u were correct, the red curry was actually to die for!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T09:37:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401016543282835","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"I told you!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T13:10:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDAxMDE2NTQzMjgyODM1","before":"NDAwNzY2NDkzMzA3ODQw"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_401014389949717","from":{"name":"Sanoober Roohi","id":"701998125"},"message":"Double Chocolate Fudge Cake from Heavenlicious!","type":"photo","created_time":"2012-06-20T13:06:28+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-20T13:06:28+0000","picture":"http://photos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/t1/577485_435056909842276_628464572_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d435056909842276\u0026set\u003da.424590410888926.117719.424572734224027\u0026type\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif"}]}
