My pet peeve was not the food, but the administration ( things on the menu not available, or the restaurant running out of desserts etc) and service ( had to go the main reception to find a waiter to serve us throughout our evening, on more than 2 occasions etc ). Aman Virji had inboxed me once to tell me to give it a try again....I wanted to do so without announcing it to him, so that I could truly assess the restaurant. This last sunday evening as late as 10pm, my hubby and I decided to go for an impromptu dinner at 44. It was packed! We eventually got a table and ordered our food: hot and sour soup, caesar salad, some gourmet burger for my hubby. The ambience,food and service were impeccable, infact the staff was very attentive. I really wanted to try the hotpot, but I was informed that it was meant for 3-4 people, so I declined. Aman Virji very well done and I\u0027m so glad to see that even in these dire times, your restaurant is prospering.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-14T09:07:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-14T16:19:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"786945014","name":"Samia Chundrigar"},{"id":"1652751344","name":"Rameen Alvi"},{"id":"844250583","name":"Salman Ali"},{"id":"505055634","name":"Umme Ifrah Arif"},{"id":"100004102427163","name":"Malyha Shuja"},{"id":"513232132","name":"Nazia Latif"},{"id":"502393296","name":"Raheel Masood"},{"id":"524835210","name":"Ali Dayo"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"1013410116","name":"Lailumah Shah - Nasar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAxMzQxMDExNg\u003d\u003d","before":"Nzg2OTQ1MDE0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"557212344329920","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"\u003d) good to hear!!
