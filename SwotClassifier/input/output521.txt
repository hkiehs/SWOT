Just for fun :) but well, the fact that we had to wait for 6-7 hours just for the ballot boxes to be delivered at the stations ruined all our fun plans! \n\nEnded up hanging out later at Dolmen Mall. And when i went to GJC tonight to ask for their iced coffee offer for voters, they told me the deal was only during the voting hours :O i couldnt believe my ears, so i asked him again. Ofcourse the reply was the same. \nI did ask him to explain to me how possible it is for people to be standing in long queues at polling stations for hours, and also be able to claim this offer at the same time? He had no replies to that. \nI understand free stuff cannot be offered at my own terms and conditions but seriously? I think if they had added a few hours to this deal, some people including me wouldve def been happier. \nThen again, i do understand that no one had anticipated such pathetic arrangements by ECP and interference by you-know-who!!! \nSigh.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-11T20:40:51+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-12T15:15:12+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"689535117","name":"Ahsen Wali Mohammad"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"100000674735601","name":"Muhammad Patel"},{"id":"1658841118","name":"Tara Kashif"},{"id":"593385155","name":"Mubashir Zuberi"},{"id":"1840274698","name":"Aasya Aamir"},{"id":"1059103092","name":"Rao Mohd Ali"},{"id":"626070061","name":"Salman Aly"},{"id":"526706972","name":"Mazuin Zulfiqar"},{"id":"635150123","name":"Aamna Bilal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjM1MTUwMTIz","before":"Njg5NTM1MTE3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"556129761104845","from":{"name":"Leena S Naqvi","id":"508726329"},"message":"I hear you!!

I got free at 6PM from the Zamzama polling station and I was denied the complimentary beverage at pie in the sky ... sure I wasn\u0027t dying for it, but if as you say this ploy was a positive gesture for the process, then why did they renege on their committed gesture?

That was actually the whole point of my earlier post. There is a limit to everything and if a particular establishment reached that limit, they were well within their rights to make that known when it happened. As you said, you weren\u0027t dying for it ... so why make a big deal. It was a positive gesture and thousands of freebies were delivered as promised ... ok, maybe not to you. I do not see that as poor management or preparation. Were they supposed to just keep going and going till people stopped coming? I am sure you know that every business has limits on any offer they put out there. Did you expect to spend hours at the polling stations or did anyone predict the chaos that occurred? Don\u0027t think so ... and therefore, while I do understand you are upset, there are many of us that feel that the gesture was enough ... and whether we collected on the offer or not, it was a good thing.
