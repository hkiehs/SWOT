The chicken burgers, however, could taste better with addition of some sauces like BBQ or mushroom sauce, etc. The fries were aplenty, nice and crispy, but the seasoning (opted for spicy) tasted a little too synthetic for my taste. The 1.5 litre coke was delivered room temperature. :/ \n\nThe bestest part of the deal (that I\u0027m proud to state was my suggestion to De Joe!!) is the 4 cakes platter. The dainty cake pieces are a dessert-a-holic\u0027s dream come true!! \n\nThe deal may be good for one person if one wishes to stuff themselves and leave no room for any more food. Alternatively, it can very easily be shared by two persons, provided they\u0027ve had their pakoras and dahi baray for iftari. All in all, for the product being offered, the price is great!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-09T23:22:35+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-10T08:33:13+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"711699788","name":"Sanaa Zubairi"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ2NjY0NTM4","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"422545791129910","from":{"name":"Saira Malik","id":"1133719630"},"message":"I forgot to mention that the choice of burgers and cakes is flexible.

The order was supposed to be due on wednesday, kept calling no response. Left a text today also and no response. I wanted to try those mexican buns but i feel a reply or a call for not having the order ready would have been good. Communication would have good. Really wanted to try the mexican buns. I am sure it would have been annoying had i done the same after placing the order ;) anyone else who has mexican buns like them?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-09T12:47:34+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-09T19:19:00+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5NDIyOTQ0","before":"NTA5NDIyOTQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"422444014473421","from":{"name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary","id":"100000093496883"},"message":"Fatso\u0027s the mini caterer","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-09T16:55:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"164092510280585","name":"Fatso\u0027s the mini caterer","type":"page","offset":0,"length":24}]},{"id":"422480927803063","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Wajiha Afridi - could be some technical issue - phone lines and connections can go awry. agreed that if an order was confirmed then some kinda communication should have been made - but drop them an inbox message or on their own wall. am sure someone will get in touch with you","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-09T19:13:32+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"806415522","name":"Wajiha Afridi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"422482287802927","from":{"name":"Wajiha Afridi","id":"806415522"},"message":"Yes.
