In Pakistan commonly served at Pizzerias to drizzle over, adding that zing to your pizza or sometime with Chinese food as well. Here goes an image from the Café Blue Ginger a huge bottle of the most addictive form of Olio Picante, the Hot Red Chillie Oil sitting on our side board, its house prepared and truly awesome. Red chillies is the most seductive form of flavour for the palate, and a few drops of this Red Chillie Oil to jazz up the salads, pastas, khowsuey, fish dishes that you are served with at Café Blue Ginger. So next time at CBG ask your order taker to bring that oil and only try it on a small portion of your food first, before deciding on drizzing all over your plate.","type":"photo","created_time":"2012-05-22T20:42:14+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-22T20:42:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1454993708","name":"Tehniyat K.

Everything from the service to the food to the personal care that the management took in our party was great. The waiters were diligent and efficient, the GM was very helpful and the food was very tasty! I had a great time and it was one of the best birthdays ever. Thankyou! :)\n\nAlso, just wanted to add one thing. We had booked their lounge for the event and were supposed to have at least 25 people coming in. Sam (the GM) had given us a per head cost based on that minimum number of people coming in. However, due to some last minute cancellations that people gave us, about 15 people ended up coming. However, Afroza Aunty and Sam were great to not charge us that much extra for the cancellations, which was super duper sweet of them! Thankyou so much for that as well! :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-22T07:59:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-22T10:44:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"641225588","name":"Sarah Akber"},{"id":"505630511","name":"Maliha Tariq-Ahmad"},{"id":"740145379","name":"Muneeb Zuberi"},{"id":"641326124","name":"Saad Habib"},{"id":"501891633","name":"Komal Tauqeer"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"525700760","name":"Nadia Naeem"},{"id":"541353397","name":"Nida Azwar"},{"id":"506869347","name":"Hassaan AY"},{"id":"100000391823197","name":"Farah S.
