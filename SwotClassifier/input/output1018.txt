Turkey Burger was one big fat beautiful burger pattie, tender, tasty and super juicy (have had the prawn burger previously which was amazing so can safely say TUC really knows how to do burgers). Fusilli Arrabbiata  (fusilli made from scratch at TUC), had a beautiful sauce with tomatoes, olives, and fresh fresh basil. Highly recommended!
