I ordered for iftar \u0026 opted for the shaheen pik up option as thr r less chances of mix ups plus urbanite take rs 150 per delivery also..however.. The FETA Sanwich- FETA cheese salad with blckened most mosit chicken was simply divine \u0026 I re fridgirated it hence making the lettus mix all crispy \u0026 crunchy... Panini pesnto sandwich was a bit dry in proportion to the panini , could do with some more pesto mix . Yellow curry beef was tender aromatic but would have tasted more authentic if was served with jasmin rice thn plain ublay hue chawal...\u0026 kafir leaves were lost in the curry it got mayb over boiled in the curry... Alhundulilah , Over all a good appatizing FRESH healthy meal .after all tht fry \u0026 talaan galore .

First off all sorry for the mistake I named it quarter pounder, actually it\u0027s half pounder. BUT for me it did turn out to be a quarter pounder. It wasn\u0027t heavy enough for me.\n\nFor Ramadan combo I got the burger, fries, curly fries and coke for 650rps. (value for money)\n\nCoke: 10/10 chilled and amazing as always :p\nFries and curly fries: good but nothing out of this world, 6-7/10\nAnd then the burger: I have to say it tasted absolutely AMAZING. I enjoyed it honestly and the beef patty was perfectly char grilled and a treat with every bite, it was tasty and soft. \nThe ONLY issue I think is that when delivered it\u0027s just warm and about to get cold and not hot. Nothing was hot. So that\u0027s one recommendation.\n\nI would recommend this burger to all SWOTies and my friends when we\u0027re on the burger lookout.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T19:50:15+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591266940924460","from":{"name":"Abdul Basit Sivany","id":"100001089240373"},"message":"I wish I would have added an extra beef patty for which I planned initially.
