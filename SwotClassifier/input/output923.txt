I fall more and more in love with it every time I go. Took my mom and sister along today and had a lovely evening. Started off with the complimentary bread basket which is definitely the best in Karachi. Tried the chicken mushroom risotto which was smooth, creamy perfection. It\u0027s hard to explain how good it was in words!My sister is a very picky eater and it is very hard to please her but the burger she ordered was a huge hit!The margarita pizza was just the way it should be..with a firm, crispy thin crust.\nThe brownie was good as usual and the bread pudding..ohhh the pudding deserves a separate post of its own. I can never get enough of it. It is truly a work of art.\nWe had stuffed ourselves to the brim when the waiter brought in a complimentary dessert (Did I mention how much I adore the service at Olivetto?). It was a trifle except that it was much much more....a crumbly base which had a hint of cinnamon, a mix of fruits and cake, sweet custard and a touch of cream on top.. YUM.\nI know that a review is supposed to be have constructive criticism so that eateries can improve but there wasn\u0027t a single thing that could have been better than it was for me.

Taking into account the sort of reviews this place is getting, you either love the place or hate it. I for one loved it. I have come back to Patio  after a good 2/3 years and this place has certainly transformed. I was quite unimpressed with my last and only visit it and rated the place as quite mediocre. It is very very different now. \n\nThe decor has certainly improved, making the place look much more alive, modern and cozy. The service was prompt and friendly with the waiters seeming quite informed. I tried the Tapas Platter and Cheese Fondue for starters. I did not like the Cheese Fondue but loved the (baked?) mushrooms and Wasabi Pineapple Prawns. The prawns had a very interesting flavoring, the mixture of wasabi and pineapple did wonders to it. Highly recommended to be ordered on their own. \n\nFor the main course I ended up ordering the Tokyo Fish, apparently it is one of their signature dishes. It is Penguasis fish, batter fried. Crispy from the outside and very delicate from the inside. It is accompanied by garlic fried rice and spinach. Simply superb.\n\nFor the dessert I had Choco-bans which were just brilliant. Spring roll like concoction which are stuffed with bananas. They too were really really good. \n\nThough there is certainly room for improvement as my friends who ordered Mutton Maas were not really impressed with it. One even remarked that the portions were small. These are the areas that ought to be looked at. But overall a great experience. I personally see a good future for this place if they fine tune it a little more.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T20:06:38+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372078126176677","from":{"name":"Shaikh Fawad","id":"694238742"},"message":"started it all w/ the Cheese Fondue which was a very gud start, rich, but not too heavy, \u0026 not at all processed:))) the array of Tapas\u003cmentioned above\u003e were really gr8too\u003clight, tasty, wonderfully flavorful, in other words subtle, but sexy:\u003e....steak au gratin (medium) was the best dish on the table\u003cstaff was attentive, i improvised my steak w/ finely chopped ginger, really enhances the flavors:\u003e, done to perfection, and generous enough to feed the whole table:D, and the Peanut butter mousse\u003cin a deliciously edible chocolate cup:\u003e \u0026Naughty Toffee were the perfect end to an already gr8 evening.....gud work PATIO!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T20:51:43+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372093282841828","from":{"name":"Asghar Khan","id":"100001971572016"},"message":"1250 per head with drinks and water + tips +tax can you break dawn just for information...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T21:20:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372107876173702","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"the total bill was 9005 - we rounded it to a even 1250 per person. just easy math.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T21:48:31+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372219232829233","from":{"name":"Danyal Achria","id":"582960575"},"message":"Faisal Naseer \u0026 Shaikh Fawad Thanks a lot for the review.

Realized after seeing it that one should not go for desi at a place like The Patio, so obviously it was more of a wrong choice made (If I wanted desi, I should\u0027ve just listened to Sarah J.K and ordered the BBQ Platter). Having said the cheese fondue I felt was extremely good and not at all too cheesy :P. The Tapas platters like everyone else mentioned were brilliant. The desserts were out of this world, even though the raving reviews for the naughty toffee, i felt the peanut butter oreo mousse was even better. It was to my liking sweeeeeeetness galore, the naughty toffee wasn\u0027t as sweet as this. So I guess for people who don\u0027t have too much of a sweet tooth the toffee will do. Service was one of if not the best at any restaurant. If ever one needed anything, you\u0027d look up and the server would be right there, Top notch stuff. Another thing a couple of us thought were that the portions were a bit small, but keeping the per head cost in mind afterwards, didn\u0027t seem as bad.

We\u0027ve all seen the colorful advertising and the retro videos, but I\u0027ve yet to see anyone write about their experience first hand on SWOT.  \n\nFirst things first - the Prime Rib Steak was fantastic! Worchesire base, pepper/mint seasoning, and a mushroom garnish.  This is meat and potatoes.  I ordered the steak \"medium\" and it was just slightly pink in the middle.  Just the way I like it :). Best of all it was only 750 rupees.  THIS IS A STEAL. \n\nThe Teriyaki burger my friend had was a gargantuan.  It\u0027s BIG. The perfect size for you hungry guys out there. If your like him, you want something juicy, large, and filling.  Special note- we loved the sauce.  We actually ended up dipping our fries into it :). \n\nAll in all- I would reccomend it, and I would DEFINETELY order again. It has excellent value (our total meal was 1200)- and the food is absolutely reminiscent of my BBQ experiences in Montreal.  I hope you guys give it a shot.

I had opted the deal for three with Hot and Sour Soup which was very ketchupy and not at all thick the way soup should be, the wantons were good, the Chicken chilly vegetable had very little chicken and predominantly more of raw and uncut vegetables which should have been finally chopped, they refused me Chicken fried rice and instead gave me Garlic rice which was under cooked (Katcha) and had a funny smell in it. The need to work on their rice and cook it properly so it retains its flavor and is soft not hard and dry. Last but not the least the Chicken Chowmein noodles were also undercooked and could be much better in quality. I agree the helping was good but its no use if they cannot maintain the quality and match flavor and taste of the competitors.
