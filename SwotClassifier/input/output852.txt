Absolutely LOVED the spicy chicken wings. Tangy, hot and perfectly spiced…I’ll be ordering these every time I go there! The smoked turkey sandwich was ok.. just a little on the dry side. The pizza..aahhh they know how to do their thin crust pizza! It was cheesily fantastic! Thoroughly enjoyed everything! And I think we have all read enough about the froyo here. It tastes even better than the way people describe it on this page! I’m really happy to see that this place has maintained its superior quality over the past months..I’ve always left this place as a happy and satisfied customer :)\n\nAlso, I went to roasters (I was dragged there lol). My friends ordered two different types of steaks and liked them quite a lot. I had a bite of both and did not like them AT all…they were tough and covered with a greasy sauce...not appetizing at all.  I just stuck to cheesy smashed potatoes which I found surprisingly good and ordered a drink called lava ice which was basically hersheys syrup in cold milk..not recommended.. I couldn’t bring myself to order anything else there. That place is not for me.\n\nI have to try tutti frutti atleast twice a week.. they had lychee this week which is my favourite..didn’t like pistachio..i don’t think it’s a good flavor for froyo..it is nutty and a bit like taro but taro is much much better.\n\nAnd yes, I got rolls from Eaton. Chicken chutney rolls. Fresh crisp paratha with spicy chutney and tender chicken boti…. Tasted Amazing!!! These rolls followed by a huge cup of coffee ice cream from kaybees made for a completely satisfying (not to mention economical) meal..yumm","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-17T17:13:07+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-17T17:13:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"682241004","name":"Atif Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjgyMjQxMDA0","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_398756963508793","from":{"name":"Mohammed Ali Parekh","id":"691716489"},"message":"Last nite at Kamamishi was the absolute worst service I have received at any restaurant; and I like Kamamishi.  It was a group of 14 and were there by 930p.  Appetizers were ordered, were served in time, and tasted good.  After that it was all downhill.\nNothing out of the ordinary was ordered for main course, most ppl ordered the usual teppanyaki/teriyaki etc.  Four major issues that we had after that:\n1)  Dinner was served quite late.  I guess preparing for 14 people takes time but it was being served piecemeal.\n2)  I ordered tuna avocado roll.  When it was served, it looked good.  Took the first bite and guess what, I tasted apple.  Why in the world would u use an apple in tuna avocado roles.  They have never done that before and I\u0027m quite frequent at Kamamishi.  If they didn\u0027t have avocado, say so and I\u0027ll order something else.\n3)  Drinks were ordered with dinner.  People were finishing their meal and drinks would just not show up.  Kept on asking, but they just won\u0027t serve it.\n4)  And the worst of all:  One guest ordered beef teppanyaki and it was brought out when everyone else was done with their dinner.  I\u0027m not talking a little late.  I\u0027m talking good 30mins after when everyone else was served.  Twice the waiter was asked about it and even once the manager was notified.  They kept saying, \"sir, abhi aa raha hai.\"  Ofcourse it was sent back because he was put off by the miserable service by then and was no longer hungry.\nOver all the staff was inefficient, clueless and didn\u0027t know their own menu.\nI forced everyone to go there last nite as majority favored Sakura.  I didnt hear the end of it and was quite embarrassed.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-16T08:57:53+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-17T17:02:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"686445178","name":"Fahim Bilwani"},{"id":"580750864","name":"Murtaza Salim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTgwNzUwODY0","before":"Njg2NDQ1MTc4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"398764280174728","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Please complain to the concerned party.
