You are attended to politely and welcomed warmly by the owners who are hands on in their Cafe. The menu is simple nothing fancy - almost familiar items from at least 3 other cafes in town. So you make your selection and the food is served within a few minutes. It\u0027s decent fresh food, not out of some gourmet food show. All this while your waiter has been attentive and been handy when needed. The ambiance is pleasant,  the food (3 ***), the service good and the music playing amazing. Your entire bill was about 1K per person.\n\nSCENARIO 2:-\nYou and the same number of friend decide to go fine dining - call up the best place in town - you are snootily told sorry we can accommodate you today, and take a booking for 3 days in the future - which you have to go and confirm in person or else that booking will be null and void. You do that too. And finally the time to dine arrives - you get there on time but one member of your party gets stuck and is delayed - is on the way. You are received with cool disdain and quietly shown to your table. When they discover you are one person short, and you explain the delay - you are informed that whether you are finished or not with you food you need to vacate the table within 2 hours since its booked for another party. All this while the management/ owners of the establishment look at you as thou they have done you a favour allowing you in. The food that is available will make any foodie wanna weep with joy from the menu selection to the way the food was prepared - leaves you in awe. You feel yes I can die tonight but will die happy. Now the ambiance is clean and simple not fantastic the service very professional but NOT with a smile. And yes you are asked to leave before you can finish you dessert - since the last member of you group showed up later and was still having his mains. You bill comes to over 3k per head. \n\nTHE OBJECT OF THIS POST. I WANT TO KNOW \n\n1) WHICH PLACE WILL YOU BE GOING BACK TO AGAIN AND AGAIN\n2) IS THE FOOD THE \"ONLY\" PART OF AN EVENI OUT WITH FRIENDS \n\nI would love to hear all you have to say.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-08T22:05:12+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-12T12:27:10+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000391823197","name":"Farah S.
