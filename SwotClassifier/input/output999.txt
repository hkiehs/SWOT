A clinic has been established in which milk is used for treatment (Urazakov and Bainazarov, 1974). Patients with chronic hepatitis had improved liver function after being treated with camel milk (Sharmanov et al., 1978). In fact, camel milk was as effective as ass milk and superior to treatment with only medication or a diet consisting of cow milk proteins.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-17T16:07:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"279475302103627","from":{"name":"Sarah J.K","id":"708025491"},"message":"The camel milk works as a laxative on people unaccustomed to drinking this milk (Rao et al., 1970).

The milk is said to be of such a strength, and to have such health-giving properties, that all the bacteria are driven from the body. This said to be true only for camels that eat certain shrubs and bushes. The shrubs and bushes are, themselves, used in the preparation of medicines.
