I really wanted to try the Ohntheemin Asitana but I have to preorder it a day in advance. The person that took my call spoke English well and knew what they were doing. They even gave me a follow up call letting me know I had to wait a little longer for my dessert. I ended up ordering  Khow suey, Chaanzah and caramel pudding.  I personally am not much of a khow suey person although my moms side (khoja) loves it - so I sent it over with to my moms house. I was happy with my Chaanzah. Living in NY I always enjoyed Thai and Vietnamese food, especially the soups such as the Tom Kha Gha, Tum Yum, Pho and my all time favorite- La Sa Ga (chicken curry soup with cellophane noodles). To my amazement, the Chaanzah was great. It\u0027s a curry soup with an ample amount of chicken and bean thread noodles very similar in taste to the La Sa Ga,  but it was better because of the condiments. It was accompanied with sliced boiled eggs, fried onions, lemon wedges, crushed red chili pepper, and coriander. There may have been a tad too much oil and maybe the quantity of the curry should be increased in comparison to the vermicilli other than that it was perfect. I really liked the egg addition to it. It\u0027s very filling and definitely a must try for all you soup lovers. Ohhh how could i forget dessert, the caramel pudding came piping hot in an aluminum pot. It\u0027s still in the refrigerator and I couldnt resist taking a bite out of it - perfectly sweet. That I\u0027ll save for later tonight.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-07T15:28:09+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"312737768777380","from":{"name":"Afroze Khan","id":"1053828627"},"message":"I will definitely be trying this soon...:-) Thanks for opening my eyes to this dish Saira","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-07T15:32:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira","type":"user","offset":84,"length":5}]},{"id":"312741505443673","from":{"name":"Saira Naqui","id":"507748093"},"message":"Afroze, it looks better than the picture :) ... and comes in this cute tupperware type round container.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-07T15:38:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"312741918776965","from":{"name":"Afroze Khan","id":"1053828627"},"message":"what\u0027s their number?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-07T15:39:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"312743212110169","from":{"name":"Saira Naqui","id":"507748093"},"message":"http://www.facebook.com/groups/339613832724115/?ref\u003dts#!/photo.php?fbid\u003d10150631575640856\u0026set\u003do.339613832724115\u0026type\u003d3\u0026theater","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-07T15:41:52+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"312743658776791","from":{"name":"Saira Naqui","id":"507748093"},"message":"thats the menu for burma house w/phone number","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-07T15:42:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"312743888776768","from":{"name":"Afroze Khan","id":"1053828627"},"message":"Thank you:-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-07T15:43:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"312770928774064","from":{"name":"Cheena Chhapra","id":"100000528920624"},"message":"Please can I have the number please of the Burma house and where is it located..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-07T16:29:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"313238918727265","from":{"name":"Aisha Malik","id":"554938233"},"message":"Thanks for the info Saira, cant wait to try it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-08T06:46:58+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"313243852060105","from":{"name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi","id":"1198831376"},"message":"Hmmmm sounds yummy , weisey where r u Saira haven\u0027t seen u long time ...come over to Bots lots of new additions ...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-08T07:05:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"313291592055331","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"It was really yum.
