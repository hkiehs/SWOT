Although it was not very much reshmi.\n\n*Brain masala was way too good and was also very nice looking, spices were balanced at least as per my taste but I was a bit sad to see the portion size, was recommended for 2 but was not even enough for 1.\n\n*Behari boti was below average in taste but the meat was well done. \n\n*Was surprised to see pathan style parathas, was expecting poori parathas (Bundoo Khan Style). This needs consideration at their end. \n\n*Lassi was good, but then no Lassi is bad to me so perhaps I may not be able to figure it out correctly :)\n\nService:\n \nThey were efficient, the food was on table with in the promised time, as such no issues noticed. \n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall it was an above avg or I think I can say a pleasant experience and I can definitely visit them again for the Sajji and Brain Masala !!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-29T01:06:43+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-30T21:17:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"100000501177768","name":"Mohsin Hasan"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"100006519972294","name":"Ali Raza Q"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDA2NTE5OTcyMjk0","before":"MTAwMDAwMzQ5ODA0NzU0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"625908250793662","from":{"name":"Yasir Abdullah","id":"716073180"},"message":"Share something about the charges","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-29T06:18:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626017687449385","from":{"name":"Sheikh Hasan Rasul","id":"522977702"},"message":"It was 4.5k for the above said.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-29T11:56:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626727227378431","from":{"name":"Sheikh Hasan Rasul","id":"522977702"},"message":"You\u0027re welcome Sajjad Diner : )","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T21:14:49+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100006692137726","name":"Sajjad Diner","type":"user","offset":15,"length":12}]},{"id":"626727720711715","from":{"name":"Tahir Rasul","id":"701976003"},"message":"^ Give me your laptop and watch when you explode.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T21:16:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626728720711615","from":{"name":"Sheikh Hasan Rasul","id":"522977702"},"message":"You won\u0027t be alive to use it either !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T21:17:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI2NzI4NzIwNzExNjE1","before":"NjI1OTA4MjUwNzkzNjYy"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_626686114049209","from":{"name":"Adnan Syed","id":"697302245"},"message":"BURGER KING.

Their menu very interesting. Wife had the dry chicken chili, kids shared a chicken tikka, and I had the Thai red curry chicken. All entries were quite nice and excellent price. Our server Manzoor very nice and helpful guy. The place is small, I think maybe 4-5 tables. We like to go out early, so were lucky the place was empty at 8pm. Later, people started coming in quick. I heard there is a branch at Zamzama, so will try it there. Would love to try their chicken and mushroom and the other Chinese entries. If anyone has tried their burgers do let me know what its like as I\u0027m always interested in good burgers.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-30T15:54:04+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-30T18:11:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000999733392","name":"Hadi Khan"},{"id":"100005334067873","name":"Maqsood Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDA1MzM0MDY3ODcz","before":"MTAwMDAwOTk5NzMzMzky"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"626643367386817","from":{"name":"Zahoor Ahmed","id":"100002653854221"},"message":"Try chicken burger,beef burger grilled chicken and much more at cafeela zamzama for more detail please call 02135295081 / 02135876883","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T18:11:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI2NjQzMzY3Mzg2ODE3","before":"NjI2NjQzMzY3Mzg2ODE3"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_626625924055228","from":{"name":"Patio Pk","id":"100005838280535"},"message":"The Patio - Lunch \u0026 Dinner \n(Tuesday to Friday 12:30pm to 9:00pm)\nTwo Course Meal \nRs.690/+ Tax\nMAIN \u0026 DESSERT\n\nThree Course Meal \nRs.790/+ Tax\nSTARTER + MAIN + DESSERT \n(Inclusive of beverages)","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-30T17:31:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-30T17:31:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTgyOTYwNTc1","before":"NTgyOTYwNTc1"}}},"picture":"http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/1382432_169851406552801_1614390794_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d169851406552801\u0026set\u003dgm.626625924055228\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_626606514057169","from":{"name":"Rabya Afsar Rizwan","id":"706435025"},"type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-30T16:34:23+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-30T16:44:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"567197680","name":"Seema Mustafa"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"559218922","name":"Moazzam Husain"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"594796590","name":"Ufaq Ashfaque"},{"id":"100001387803315","name":"Haris Vohra"},{"id":"531280225","name":"Rabia Jehan"},{"id":"100003216046346","name":"Shezi Memon"},{"id":"100000764441277","name":"Shahyaan Abd"},{"id":"509213482","name":"Faria Sahar Syed"},{"id":"515659888","name":"Nadia Faisal"},{"id":"565519341","name":"Fawad Mustafa"},{"id":"517589528","name":"Ayesha Sheikh"},{"id":"1222986707","name":"Nida Hammad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTIyMjk4NjcwNw\u003d\u003d","before":"NTY3MTk3Njgw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"626607697390384","from":{"name":"Nida Hammad","id":"1222986707"},"message":"looks yumm","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T16:37:15+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626609237390230","from":{"name":"Moiz Sajid","id":"100001968266894"},"message":"yeah :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T16:40:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626609274056893","from":{"name":"Rabya Afsar Rizwan","id":"706435025"},"message":"Baigan ka bharta and daal saambar were on top in terms of best among all..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T16:40:58+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626611137390040","from":{"name":"Nida Hammad","id":"1222986707"},"message":"will def try it :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T16:44:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI2NjExMTM3MzkwMDQw","before":"NjI2NjA3Njk3MzkwMzg0"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_626079304109890","from":{"name":"Mahnoor Ahmed","id":"1134768220"},"message":"how is MYOB??? comments please as I want to have a good beef burger and can\u0027t find any good place..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-29T14:41:19+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-30T16:06:51+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"8000747","name":"Ayesha Mohammed"},{"id":"100004401815837","name":"Nikki Fidai"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDA0NDAxODE1ODM3","before":"ODAwMDc0Nw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"626086277442526","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Had an excellent beef burger from OPTP today.
