Appetizers: Mezze Platter and Bruschetta, the platter was excellent as usual and the Bruschetta crisp toasted bread and full of flavor. Main Courses: Spicy Hommour, Feta Stuffed Chicken (had a bite of this, excellent! \u0026 mine was Grilled Calamari with Turkish Salad (originally an appetizer, but I wanted dessert so I ate light, it was perfectly grilled with a tangy sauce and fresh iceberg on the side) Dessert: Coffee \u0026 Bread \u0026 Butter Pudding with Ice cream, with a spun caramel topping what can I say, it was SUBLIME :) looked beautiful and tasted bombastic and I don\u0027t even have a sweet tooth!  mmmmmmmmmmmmm\n\nService was prompt, friendly and polite as always, (we sat chatting long after the bill was paid, no hovering, no discreet coughs, no switching off lights)  food was exquisite, innovative and ample, we and our guests were satiated and ecstatic.  Afroz the GM was solicitous and went out of her way to make our evening perfect, and it was! \n\nThank you everyone at Olivetto, in my opinion you rank among the best of the best :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-25T11:34:34+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-26T21:24:40+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1652751344","name":"Rameen Alvi"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"643423090","name":"Junaid Zuberi"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"100000128733524","name":"Rehan Shakur"},{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"807135719","name":"Feryal Rehman"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"100000209066401","name":"Faten Razzak Dada"},{"id":"585622689","name":"Naveed Ismail"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"559781899","name":"Ayesha Eirabie"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTU5NzgxODk5","before":"MTY1Mjc1MTM0NA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"303290249722132","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Hahahahahahahahaha what a lovely starting line......\n\nSo my reply get in line......you will have to fight me to death.....I am marrying Olivetto....Afroza Khala - I need favouritism!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-25T11:36:05+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"303291693055321","from":{"name":"Ismaa Khan","id":"728371533"},"message":"lol I should have realized there would be a line :) and btw nepotism sucks!!!!!

What a night. Firstly a big THANK YOU to our Host Faisal. \nThe menu was a tastings of different seafood dishes from around the world, which sadly I could not be a part of since I\u0027m allergic to seafood.  I ordered my two fave dishes, Tori Katsu and Gyu Teriyaki which I had with a bowl of steamed rice. The chicken was light and crispy, and the beef was succulent and full of flavor! After dinner we made our way down to TSB for desserts and coffee. I just had a spoon of the crunchy coated ice-cream (don\u0027t know what it is called) but sure was good! I was eyeing Reshma Rajpar\u0027s banaoffe dessert which I just managed to resist. Will go bak and order it one day! Sadaf Munir entertained us with her lovely singing at the karaoke, but sadly was shadowed by our new found songstress Saira Naqui!! Oh boy and did she sing!! such immense joy brought uncontrollable tears to my eyes. ( ok Abid Aziz Merchant, it wasn\u0027t just the smoke, I admit it now).
