About 4 days ago I went to LogInn Lounge and ate with Abid Aziz Merchant, Aalia Mahboob Elahi, Saeed Jamal Tariq, in the presence of the owner.\n\nOrdered the 1/2 kg Pepper Steak Plate, did not tell them how I wanted it. The result was FANTASTIC....It was Medium Done...and thats how I recommend people have it to maintain the juiciness of the cut (which by the way was a beautiful cut). The meat was tender and easy to cut through. The Pepper Steak Sauce was probably one of the best I\u0027ve had in a while, it was rich and creamy with a very distinct pepper taste. The best part was the sauce was smooth and not lumpy like I\u0027ve tasted on occasion in the past in other restaurants, so clearly it was prepared using the right technique.\n\nI\u0027m a big eater so this 1/2 kg Steak is just what the doctor ordered for me (this doctor is obviously not a cardiologist). I plan to try the steak once more before I leave just so I can take the taste with me to Canada.\n\nBRAVO!!!!

Took a peek at their breads, like their spread, took the Multi Bran Brown Bread, Chicken and Veg patties, Croissants, Poche, and two other breads whose name i cannot remember, with butter in it.
