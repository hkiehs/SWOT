Since my below average experience at Berrylicious yesterday I have been wanting to go to TF. And lo, what a great trip it turned out to be. Picked myself up a jumbo cup and filled it to the brim with pomegranate, lychee, banana and original. Banana and original tart flavors were good, pomegranate was very good but the star of the evening was the lychee froyo. That was exceptionally good. Sprinkled the froyo with coconut shavings and sesame seed and that added a whole new dimension to the froyo and added a interesting crunchiness to it. Once again the entire experience of making your own froyo with massive flavors and toppings is just epic. Eagerly awaiting their other flavors.","type":"photo","created_time":"2012-05-15T17:25:47+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-16T17:53:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000867562460","name":"Akbar Ashiq Ali"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"100003048636530","name":"Sami Baba"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"624456301","name":"Amna Magsi"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"509700022","name":"Hiba Akmal"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzNTIzNjMzOQ\u003d\u003d","before":"MTAwMDAwODY3NTYyNDYw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"379767588741064","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"which flavour is this ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-15T17:27:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"379767818741041","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"oh how is lychee ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-15T17:28:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"379767968741026","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"have u tried red velvet ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-15T17:28:31+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"379768478740975","from":{"name":"Faisal Naseer","id":"780902784"},"message":"Lychee is very good.
