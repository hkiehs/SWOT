We also have to see how difficult it is to make and the time it takes. Macarons are made by Lal Majid her self and not the bakers so that factors in. On top of that all of our fillings are ganache (not butter cream) made from real chocolate of course so the costs add up. Our margins on macarons are tiny and the price has remained Rs 75 since we started selling them 3 years ago. As you know globally they cost upwards of Rs 200. That said I hope you\u0027ll continue to come back every time you crave one! also I hope you took advantage of free macarons during Macaron week which just passed.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-06T10:20:01+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"534888776562277","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Madiha, that\u0027s exactly what it is!
