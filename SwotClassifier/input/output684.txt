The quality of the food was excellent. We were given herb butter with garlic bread and my husband absolutely flipped for the butter. He literally wolfed down the bread. \nAppetizer: Because I have a habit of not finishing my food we generally order a salad and share. We had the mixed herb, sun-dried tomato, and mozzarella salad. The mixed Herbs were delicious and the sun-dried tomatoes had a great smoky flavour and was a good starter.\nMains: I decided to go for seafood and decided to try the grilled fish, and the server was kind enough to ensure that the fish would be red snapper and \"smell free\" Oh My God... I LOVED my fish, I asked for the sauce to be given separately so I had an un-adulterated taste of fish, it surpassed my expectations and I actually finished my entire portion. yay. My Husband had chicken with mushrooms and cheese gratin it was on a bed of fettuccine and my husband was very satisfied.\n\nDessert: THE RIDING HOOD CAFE... AMAZING!!!! There is no other word for it.. thats why I wrote their name first:) They have just launched a Belgian Chocolate Cake (today).. My husband was swooning when he ate it! He didn\u0027t even share! It was just that good. We spoke to the chief and he told us it is made of compounded chocolate. When you eat it you can tell. They richness and moisture is what you get in quality cakes abroad.  We also had the chocolate cupcakes as well as a red velvet cupcake. We were also given a Complimentary tasting of their baked samosa\u0027s. All the treats were of the highest quality and you could tell they were made with love. Both my husband and I have become Riding Hood Addicts after just one visit.

Ordered Mulligatawny and Tomato Basil soup for starters. Absolutely LOVED both soups to bits. I would specially like to mention how simple and refreshing the tomato soup was, with just enough basil. For main course, we ordered the Chicken Tournedos , Honey glazed prawns (I think thats the name) and Jalapeno Chicken. My sister didnt \u0027get\u0027 the prawns as they were maybe a bit too exotic for her. So I relished her main course as well as mine (Jalapeno chicken) ;-) Its a safe assumption that Patio now has 2 new regulars.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-20T13:11:45+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-20T13:40:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"1205101053","name":"Misbah Vaid Rizwan Hussain"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE4MzA4MDg2","before":"NTgyOTYwNTc1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"475310362520119","from":{"name":"Saima Achria","id":"518308086"},"message":"Hi Nazzia Momina - Thanks a lot for your feedback \u0026 were glad you had another positive experience at The Patio .
