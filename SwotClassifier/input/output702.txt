A great break from the Hot n Sour soups I have had before. \nIt was a bit heavy so avoid having it much if you want to enjoy the actual food.\n\nChicken Lettuce Wraps-I liked the whole idea how they were served. Chicken, lettuce and the sauce, all three were served separately so you have to make your own wrap. It stays crunchier this way. Tastes great.\n\nHoney Glazed Beef Ribs-This was a hit. Everyone liked it. Beef was cooked to perfection and it tasted divine.\n\nWasabi Prawns-Loved the texture, the taste. A must try!\n\nSzechuan Chicken-It was one of the best Szechuan Chicken I have had so far. The sauce tasted really well.\n\nKung Pao Chicken- It had a very balanced taste. But I liked Szechuan over this\nChicken Chownmein-Yummy! cooked well. A must try for everyone who likes chowmein.\n\nOverall the experience was great and so was the service.
