We ordered the potato and leek soup which was rich and creamy, just the way I like it. There was also a slightly zesty flavor in the soup, perhaps lemon, but I\u0027m not too sure. The tartness just added more flavor to the soup. For our main course we ordered Sole Mediterranean and the Chicken and Mushroom Risotto. The fish was decent, flavour and portion wise, although a better presentation could undoubtedly help. The risotto was delicious and the portion is fantastic, although a little too creamy/buttery for my liking. We ordered fresh lime with 7-up for drinks; we were initially served flat 7-ups, but they promptly replaced the drinks once we complained. The only real issue was that the lights kept flickering, I\u0027m not sure if this is intentional or if voltage was an issue yesterday, but it was a slight annoyance.
