Here\u0027s a short review:\n\n1. Food: not much variety. No Chinese [although am not a Chinese fan, but still they should cater to at least every cuisine]. The taste was good..but not something grand. It lacked the wow factor.\n\n2. Ambience: the ambience was good..but am not a fan of loud music. Since the place is small hence the singer\u0027s voice was little disturbing. They can play soft music instead of having live singers. Anyways that\u0027s not much of an issue. We even asked them to sing us a birthday song :p\n\n3. Service: the staff was very courteous. There isn\u0027t much to do for them than just being polite and smile all the way.\n\nConclusion: It was an okish experience. Not worth the money. Yes the other highlights can be bumping into celebrities, politicians or high profile people..Cuz we did bump in to Sharmila Farooqi there..:p The classiness of the place refrained me from taking a picture else I would have certainly done that :p","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-18T20:50:09+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-18T21:13:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"100002555208447","name":"Shoaib Ibrahim"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"1156277795","name":"Faizan Chaudhry"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTE1NjI3Nzc5NQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NTE2NTgyNjY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"620827614635059","from":{"name":"Tehmina \u0027Manna\u0027 Khan","id":"549225127"},"message":"I was pretty certain Dumpukht offers Indian or Pakistani cuisine..why would they serve Chinese?:/","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-18T20:57:54+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"620832261301261","from":{"name":"Nimrah Hashmi","id":"589301188"},"message":"if that\u0027s the case..then surely i ended up in the wrong buffet..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-18T21:13:46+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjIwODMyMjYxMzAxMjYx","before":"NjIwODI3NjE0NjM1MDU5"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_620767897974364","from":{"name":"Safinah D.
