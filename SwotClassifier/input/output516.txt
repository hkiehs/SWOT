Called around 7 to make a reservation and even though I ran about 15 mins late, they called back to confirm if we are coming. The ambiance was nice, although they shud turn the AC up a notch. The service was above par, and the service sizes were delightfully large (even the half plates! )\n\nWe ordered chicken corn soup (my fav) and red hot n sour. The chicken corn was dull and bland but the hot n sour was really good, hit right at the taste buds and was spicy. \n\nIn the main course, ordered Cherry Chilli chicken, kung pao , american chopsuey and schezwan. Cherry chilli chicken was ordinary, and felt almost as if it was cooked in ketchup. Schezwan was much better, a little spicier and had a nice Pakistani touch to it. Kung Pao chicken, now that was good chinease food, felt a lil tingy, looked and felt right at home there. The chopsuey cud also need a lil bit more flavour.\n\nAlso ordered mint lemonade, althu it had more mint than lemon in it and made it very \"disturbing\" to drink, but the pinacolada was very refreshing. In the end, their CC machine was down and we had to pay cash.

Total waste of Rs 3150.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-15T23:10:02+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-16T10:06:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"755946312","name":"Ali Muhammed"},{"id":"550210650","name":"Maryam Majid Khan"},{"id":"626070061","name":"Salman Aly"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI2MDcwMDYx","before":"NzU1OTQ2MzEy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"557962567588231","from":{"name":"MAleeha A","id":"510432837"},"message":"It was disappointing 6 months back too..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-16T03:15:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"557969260920895","from":{"name":"Sadia Bilwani","id":"1415702282"},"message":"I always prefer going to Expresso or Gloria jeans at DMC","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-16T03:48:17+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"558045204246634","from":{"name":"Kamran Lasi","id":"617556139"},"message":"Aisyah Basheer why dont you try Cafe DownTown for delicious wings.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-16T10:06:59+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1045161983","name":"Aisyah Basheer","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14},{"id":"370831742948207","name":"Cafe DownTown","type":"page","offset":32,"length":13}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTU4MDQ1MjA0MjQ2NjM0","before":"NTU3OTYyNTY3NTg4MjMx"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_557705147613973","from":{"name":"Anum Junejo","id":"100000577684532"},"message":"Does anyone knows the recipe of chicken rolls the one we eat at different fast food restaurants??!!
