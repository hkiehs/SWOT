The formal SWOT RATING will be done after my 3rd visit. But my first impressions will be as follows.\n\nDisclaimer:- review on three places so will be a little long, but hopefully easy to follow.\n\nCAFEELA.\nGreat concept of combining all the popular cuisines in one menu and putting in a dine-in at one the posh locations in Zamzama. Great flavours, attentive service and very easy on the wallet. A must repeat soon - my fav items - starters mein sev poori, paani poori, brain masala crispy laal atae ki naan and a glass of lassi. \n\nKHANJI\nfantastic ambiance, one of the best locations on PORT GRAND. attentive and efficient staff - also very accommodating (they actually went got us an order from another place since we had a hard core aalu-eater wi us) and great food. The items I would recommend (on just my first trip) are the mutton boti and mutton ribs (we had numkeen and I look forward to the spicy ones next time) the chicken thu well made unfortunately never scores well with me unless exceptional. The elaichee chai was just amazing and will be even more fabulous when the weather gets colder.\n\nSATTAR BUKSH\ngreat location and was access. Funky decor and an interesting place that has the potential of becoming the favourite hangout for all those looking for a place with wifi and good chai/coffee/drinks. Since they are in their infancy days (not even weeks) I will over look the few glitches. The few things that were tried today and recommended were - the bhinnote bunkebab, the daam bun kebab, the daal chawal (but didnt like the shaami kebabs) the thyme chicken, and the lassi (hmmmm yes I kinda like that over milkshake and will order it anywhere I see it on the menu) I love the little paaparde (papadoms) they served with the bun kebabs and the  best green chutney I have had outside my house. \n\nAll in all I am looking forward to SWOTTING all these places again and soon. Will rate them once I have been at least 3 times to each","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-15T19:38:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T05:49:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715251102","name":"Sophia Nazeer"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"100003247463950","name":"Murk Mustafa"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"100002814495361","name":"Studioc UpCake"},{"id":"592090015","name":"Javeria Ahmed"},{"id":"100000675092971","name":"Fahim Farooq"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"574052713","name":"Harun Aziz"},{"id":"500778016","name":"Hammad Munir"},{"id":"100003303131853","name":"Samad Fansia"},{"id":"611294921","name":"Irum Chaudhry"},{"id":"1292953231","name":"Aakash Kumar"},{"id":"709724895","name":"Annie Abbasi"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"741205131","name":"Maleeha Ahmad Qureshi"},{"id":"1324057559","name":"Safi Ahmed"},{"id":"739231013","name":"Aiya Quli"},{"id":"719028214","name":"Rehmat Ebrahim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE5MDI4MjE0","before":"NzE1MjUxMTAy"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_619277281456759/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNzE5MDI4MjE0"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619278494789971","from":{"name":"Mahrukh Abbasi","id":"519901828"},"message":"i enjoyed their tea menu:  cheeni rok ke, patti thok ke, and elaichi chai :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-15T19:40:59+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619279201456567","from":{"name":"Humera Jawed","id":"644820164"},"message":"But their tea is for 175 dunt u think so it\u0027s too over price dey r not sitting in any 5 star hotel dey should cut down deir prices","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-15T19:43:28+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619281048123049","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Humera Jawed as I said there were glitches.

On the same day when she had tried going fot cookies and cream it was watery and wouldn\u0027t form so she did not get it.\nWe visited again last night and this time my sister complained that the froyo was sour last time which made them taste their death by chocolate again and it was again sour so they told her to choose another flavour which she did, the cookies and cream, it was a little watery but considering there were no other chocolate options she chose to go with it!

Yes, yes, I know. Abhi tak try nahin kiya tha, but better late than never, right? So we ordered both the flame-grilled quarter chicken and the Row chicken, also quarter. Along with it came the assortment of pickles and sauces, white pita, and the roasted garlic and tomato soup, which was the soup of the day.\nThe soup was a wonderful surprise. Peppery, sweet with the roasted garlic, with proper tomatoey texture and just the right amount of sour to go with the sweetness of the garlic and the heat from the black pepper, this is not a soup for the fainthearted! If you prefer the weak, watered down, ketchupy versions of our local tomato soup, please refrain from trying this soup out. One can tell when \u0027propah propah\u0027 tomatoes have been used in a soup. This was the duchess of \u0027propah\u0027. \nEverything was flavorful, and had that slow roast, tender, juicy yummy chicken love coming through. The Row sauce did remind me a bit of the Nandos sauces, but somehow better, less spicy and tangy, yet more robust and well-rounded in flavor. \nThe pickles were fresh, crunchy, vinegary deliciousness.  The pita bread, thicker than I would have preferred, and was cast aside after the first bite, since it diluted and cut back the flavors of the chicken. \nDespite the higher price pointing, I would definitely go back for more of Rowtisserie.
