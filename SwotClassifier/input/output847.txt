When my father called to inquire about the order, the guy said it\u0027s raining heavily (in what part of Karachi? I am still trying to figure out), that\u0027s why the rider is late.\n\nNow the food. When I asked the order taker if American Chopsuey would be enough for 4 ppl, he said YES. And what GD delivered (fried noodles not the gravy) was NOT even enough for ONE person. As soon as I saw the quantity of fried noodles, I had to rush back in the kitchen, boil and fry noodles (fortunately we had some at home) so that we can have dinner. Now this is not what anyone would want to do when you plan to relax and eat the ordered food, right?\n\nNow, when we started having the much awaited dinner after preparing noodles I figured out American Chopsuey had PRAWNS. No one eats prawns in my family. And since we never knew about its existence IN the chopsuey, it left the filthiest flavor in mouth. Gross! \n\nQamarunnisa Asim, why do you send SO much gravy with chopsuey when you are not sending enough fried noodles? \n\nWhy haven\u0027t you mention that American chopsuey has BOTH prawns AND chicken pieces in your menu? What IF someone is allergic to seafood? \n\nI am very, very upset and disappointed today.
