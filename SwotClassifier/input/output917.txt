An impromptu plan at 1:45 to have lunch there so called to check whether a table is available.  After being kept on hold for a few minutes and giving them an assurance that our ETA would be in the next 15 minutes, we were advised to reach as early as possible.  Reached around 2 pm finding out that there was only one table occupied on the ground floor with the mezzanine being an almost full house with one or two empty tables only.  Ordered beef red curry, chicken green curry, beef in oyster sauce and ginger chicken with black mushrooms.  All 4 items were served in differed kind of serving dishes that left a very bad first impression.  Both the curries were very bland and lacked the flavor that is usually associated with Thai food.  The remaining two dishes were quite watery again.  This is not expected from Fuchsia which I rated very highly when it came to Thai food and used to compare it with the restaurants in Bangkok.  Quite a disappointing experience this visit turned out to be which is not expected at all from such a fine eatery.  And pls don\u0027t comment that it may be an off- day coz I don\u0027t believe in off-days.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-11T11:39:13+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-11T14:11:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"631611761","name":"Adnan Zafar"},{"id":"100003746073469","name":"Husnain Khan"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5NDIyOTQ0","before":"NjMxNjExNzYx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"377057929012030","from":{"name":"Najeeb Rehman","id":"749703456"},"message":"... i have been seeing the word \" bland\" being used often.. what exactly does bland mean.. can it be followed by a description, something like an ID card, or is it just a universal declaration... and how can a restaurant chef recognise bland from non-bland... to do something to correct it..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-11T11:44:21+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"377058682345288","from":{"name":"Najeeb Rehman","id":"749703456"},"message":".. i have come across bland food in france too.. for me, bland means cardboard texture and taste... but that is in gorra food, which is not liquidy, how can one say fo example: \" bland curry \" ..?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-11T11:46:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"377061249011698","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Bland curry would be one which lacks flavor and texture.

SO Tutti Frutti is very very good. \n\nThe bad. For all the calorie awareness, the condiments are geared to make up with high sugar, high fat additives, so you are actually bipolar. First you go to buy into a health proposition, then you screw it up with the thick gooey sauces that you will put all the sugar and fat back into the equation.\n\nThe market equation, bloody perfect business model, tweaked for the person who can easily lie to himself, I performed a temple run routine, did a back flip for plain peanuts on chocolate froyo. Good. Very good.\n\nBut...... Upper Crust, the product can stand on it\u0027s own, it needs no gimmick. It is a quality buy in, a gourmet buy in.
