We were a party of five people, and last night was undeniably the worst dining experience ever. Our reservation was for 9, and we reached on time. We ordered the baked crab and the calamari for starters and we loved those, however, everything went downhill from there. The food was served at 10.30 after constant reminders. We were told that one of the dishes had burnt so \"just five more minutes\". However, apart from our guest everyone got served then. The lamb chops my father ordered were to be well done as specified, apart from two, the rest were totally pink and raw. My jacket potato was cold. And moreover, to add insult to injury, we were given a bowl of french fries which were complimentary to male up for the delay in food for our guest. At that point we had lost patience and were complaining so we were told we get a complimentary fudge cake for dessert. I thought the service was horrible, not at all up to aylanto standards where we have dined many times before. And to end it , we were charged for a blue pina colada in our bill which we never ordered so had to be sent back to rectify. It was a very disappointing experience all in all.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-13T05:58:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-13T22:43:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1188460281","name":"Hira Mohammad"},{"id":"818191107","name":"Zainab Shabbir"},{"id":"574028031","name":"Shiraz Qureshi"},{"id":"517581738","name":"Armughan Ahmed Faruqi"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"550658494","name":"Amna Hanif"},{"id":"100000007535542","name":"Sumaira Khan Tanoli"},{"id":"571357266","name":"Khurram Zameer"},{"id":"678051354","name":"Hiba Parvez"},{"id":"100001262753914","name":"Musti Khan"},{"id":"649390400","name":"Amber Zulfiqar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ5MzkwNDAw","before":"MTE4ODQ2MDI4MQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"665973803453773","from":{"name":"Fatima Saleem","id":"505751528"},"message":"I had the same experience last Monday! honestly very disappointing, never going there again!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-13T07:55:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"666013870116433","from":{"name":"Mukesh Kumar","id":"659660285"},"message":"Aylanto ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-13T10:35:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"666014216783065","from":{"name":"Zaid Tehsin","id":"100001589021817"},"message":"LOL","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-13T10:37:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"666014803449673","from":{"name":"Asim Ibrahim","id":"100004366567543"},"message":"name is too awkward... just like AY LANATIYO.... they shld change the name and all the fishee stuff going there......","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-13T10:39:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"666036463447507","from":{"name":"Zain Mohatarem","id":"548391893"},"message":"I on the other hand had an excellent experience last night, excellent service, excellent food","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-13T11:41:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"666037536780733","from":{"name":"Raabi Rehman S","id":"649638362"},"message":"@ the guy who said about its name. seriously? how lame can you go :/","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-13T11:46:08+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"666039633447190","from":{"name":"Leena S Naqvi","id":"508726329"},"message":"I have previously never had a bad experience at aylanto but last night was horrific.
