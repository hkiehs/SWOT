As he entered, he called a guy to ask if there is any other table free then the one they were standing at. The guy looked at him, came near the table and then walked away to a distance and totally ignored him. However, we reached in a while and took the seats. Placed the order and in few minutes, there were burgers roaming around here and there and i was like \u0027Why so early?\u0027 - the burgers would be doomed by iftar as they would get cold and then to my utmost surprise - the burgers were on our table by 7:07pm which was 13 minutes before the Iftar and we were like :o - and as expected the burgers were weird by the time of iftar and so were the fries. I am not sure about others but my burger patty was undercooked as well or it seemed so after being lying there for a good time. The only thing which remained good was the onion rings. After we were somehow done with our burgers - were deciding to fill out the comment card, we asked for a fan from a service guy who said he is bringing in a while and never showed up :D and after sometime when a guy came to take stuff from our table, we asked him \"Pen milsakta hai\", he just slightly nodded his head and ignored the question which was asked again and left. My friend then walked up to the person looking after the floor to get the pen to fill out the comment card.\nEnd of the day, if it was not the company - at least i would have been doomed.
