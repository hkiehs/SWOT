Good ambiance, great food and no MSG makes it a must revisit restaurant. I think their key strength is their brief menu, so that they can do a good job with each item, their location in Old Clifton with easy access and parking and nice ambience. I cant identify any significant weakness based on one visit. I think they have an opportunity to make new and loyal clients among the Karachi foodies by offering deals and loyalty points. Their main threat is people getting bored by their menu (which they could offset by rotating their items while keeping the list short), or simply being pushed off the radar by another couple of good Chinese restaurants opening up soon somewhere.
