Hook Line and Sinker couldn\u0027t have been a better getaway choice. Since the menu was preset, I chose the seafood chowder, hoping that it would actually taste like clam chowder and not potato soup with a meager handful of seafood thrown in. To my delight, it was a joy to eat, and definitely filling. There was plenty of shrimp, fish, squid and NO POTATOES! Joy of joys. Since i usually wait for my soup to cool off and then have it, the temperature it was served at was perfect for me. I can however, see how it would have been a tad bit too cold for those who like their soups uber hot. I also believe a bit of sweet paprika and freshly milled black pepper would have enhanced the flavor of the soup, but that\u0027s a personal preference. \nOnto the entree, I chose the Prawn ala Rooni, which is named after the ever-charming Haroon sb, and which I hoped would live up to its name. With the promise that it would be, I dived right in with relish. Although I did  improvise and used the crusty olive bread which was served in the bread basket as a sauce mopper upper instead of the served rice, simply because I felt the rice would dilute the garlicky, gingery, peppery, spicy prawn broth I simply didn\u0027t want to miss out on. While I suppose it did seem odd to be at a fine dining establishment and using one\u0027s fingers to eat, I can\u0027t say I regret it, because my food was oh-so-mmmmm! There was a burst of flavors, the spicy, sour notes of the broth, with the tender, succulent prawns. \nFor dessert, there was a chocolate cake, which was the perfect end to a perfect evening, meeting new friends, and seeing familiar faces who I have interacted with on this very forum. I digress for a moment to say it was a delight meeting all of you. The cake was rich, dense, as Mahvish put it, chocolatey, and just how a cake should be. The frosting was smooth, velvety and gorgeous. A must-have for chocolate lovers! I couldn\u0027t finish the entire slice, even though it was so delicious, simply because I was so full. I wish I could have stayed a bit longer, but my curfew is unfortunately shorter than Cinderella\u0027s but I was so glad I didn\u0027t miss out on this dinner. It would have been my loss, for sure. In my humble opinion, everyone who loves seafood needs to go there at least once. It\u0027s an experience you won\u0027t regret. If I may though, can I ppppplllleeeeaaassseeee have a whack at the menu? Please, please, pretty please! I would, of course, have to taste ALL the items listed on it to describe them properly :D","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-25T19:20:38+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-26T13:02:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000059823691","name":"Haroon Leghari"},{"id":"718233292","name":"Naheed Ghulamhussain"},{"id":"589565258","name":"Sabrina Shahid"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"MTAwMDAwMDU5ODIzNjkx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"492898934094595","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"nice review :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-25T19:59:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"492901167427705","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Thank you :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-25T20:06:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"492941204090368","from":{"name":"Haider Zaidi","id":"687255482"},"message":"Wow ! :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-25T22:30:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"493055447412277","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Thanks very much :D Now, let me fix your menu.
