Last but not the least the host Hussain Tariq who I believe is the reason why I return to CBG. No matter how good a place is, how amazing the food is if you don’t manage the relationship with your patrons you will never earn their loyalty. I had taken my mother and daughter for dinner last Friday. And had a marvelous time. And a huge reason as how much we enjoyed the company of our host Hussain Tariq. My mom was so pleased I had taken her there and felt very comfortable and like tthe total ambiance,food and service. \nAnd now the food:  We devoured the bread tray and the dips!  We started with my fav CBG creamy garlic mushrooms- oh my…the garlic bits and the perfect smooth sauce made me literally lick the plate with the fresh garlic bread. The Tangy Prawn Skewers were perfectly bar b qued and so glad to have ordered the bigger helping of the dish! For main we took Grilled Chicken in Mushroom Sauce, Fettuccine Alfredo \u0026 a Blue Ginger Steak. Mom and daughter loved their food but I was little antsy  since if the steak is not as you like it then eating is no fun.  The steak was medium –well done perfectly as most places I end up eating well-done!!! We finished off our meal with a chilled and delicious Valentino ( combination of pineapple \u0026 strawberry)\nSo Hussain thanks once again for a beautiful culinary experience. Look forward to a breakfast now soon.

After reading all the fabulous reviews about Cafe Forty4, I decided to give them a shot last night. I guess you could call it an off day because we had a very mediocre yet expensive meal. We started our meal with the moneybag dimsum and beef carpaccio - was a bit taken aback to see the carpaccio drenched in mayo. Sadly,both appetisers and the main courses (the seafood angel hair pasta,crispy beef and steaks) were average at best. The only saving grace was the dessert (Creme brûlée and the bread pudding). On a brighter note, the service was exemplary and the ambience classy.

As compared to that Sajjad has consistency in quality of food but they too take a life time to serve their food  and need to improve on that, seems they have a shortage of staff or the line supervisors are not managing them properly.As compared to that Kababeesh\u0027s food and quality was prompt and attentive and the staff was trained to respond to their customer needs, but because it is at the end, it is not getting the attention it deserves.Ambala was another place which is quite good but needs to improve their service as the staff is uncontrolled and needs to be reminded that as a customer I demand good service quality.

Then there was low fat frittata, which had a tinge of raw egg in it! And a big boo for them to over charging us when we ordered cold coffee! Order taker firstly told me there were two options only, medium or larger, small was not an option. Then was charged extra for whipped cream whereas later found out that it was part of the order. Menu was a tad bit too confusing for me, since it was my first time and one has to order over the counter and that too without the leisure of taking time supposedly!, was made to waste double the amount that i actually would have had I been gven the correct information. \n\nError was brought to my knowledge by my wife once I came back to our table with two large glasses. Went back to complaining and the lady on the counter was adamant that I am wrong even after I had shown her the menu. Sme other chap interfered timely and acknowledge the mistake. Once it was proved and accepted by them that i had paid extra, I was told they couldn\u0027t refund me since I had used a debit card instead I could order something COMPLIMENTARY!!! ( how is it complimentary if i have paid extra due to there error?) anyways, just cuz the guy accepted the mistake I didn\u0027t grill them, came back to the tablet and enjoyed chit chat with me Mrs., forgot about the extra payment and left without getting anything for it. Realized later they didn\u0027t even bother to stop and remind me or offer the due cash or product! \n\nHad actually liked the Ambiance, was very welcoming and had this good feeling, something was very right about it but otherwise simply pathetic! \n\np.s.
