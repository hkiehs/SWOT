It was a big group that enjoys moving around during the lunch while they chat ... which was a challenge for the waiters. However, everything went pretty smoothly and over thirty people were handled very efficiently. Unless they were being kind, every single person that I spoke to after lunch had enjoyed the food and each one was very complimentary about the experience. Pretty much all the options offered in the lunch deal were test driven by the gang and everyone seemed quite happy with their meal. The value of the lunch deal that includes three courses (starter, main \u0026 dessert) and a drink is unbeatable.

Told me that my pizza and garlic bread would take 15 mins. When I went back, some lady was yelling at them about having waited an hour for her pizza ... to which the response was \"actually we have some new people working so things are not going well right now\". If that didnt scare me, my pizza arrived and was placed at the other end of a long counter while the poor kid who took my order went back to get my two orders of garlic bread supreme rather than the two pieces of garlic bread that had been given to him. During that wait, I sadly did not pay attention ... and a brainiac at the register gave that pizza away to someone else. When my garlic bread arrived, the poor kid helping me went looking for my cheese lover\u0027s pizza... which of course was not to be found. Within two minutes, another irate lady came back with bites out of my cheese pizza wondering why her chicken pizza had no chicken on it!! After watching this three stooges routine, and being asked to wait another 10-15 minutes for a replacement ... I \"politely\" (haha) declined and rather strongly asked for an immediate refund... which was given. Before I left, I suggested the manager think about hiring and training competent staff members who do not get overwhelmed when three people order at Pizza Hut. In his defense, he looked pretty haggard and probably had spent the better part of the day putting out fires ... soooooooo, my suggestion would be to wait a while before trying the Pizza Hut at Dolmen Mall ... or at the very least, take a truckload of patience with you \u0027cause it wasn\u0027t a pretty sight yesterday!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-30T17:42:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-31T05:23:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"511528845","name":"Farrukh Imam"},{"id":"748523841","name":"Bushra S Faruqi"},{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"},{"id":"100001434743152","name":"Raza Rehmani"},{"id":"545220720","name":"Imran Sheikh"},{"id":"542181852","name":"Moomal Pirzada"},{"id":"524907596","name":"Syed Zohaib"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI0OTA3NTk2","before":"NTExNTI4ODQ1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"564424250275396","from":{"name":"Tasneem Murtazaalibhai","id":"676000707"},"message":"Have eaten there two days in a row it went smoothly for me fifteen minutes they say","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-30T18:13:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"564426350275186","from":{"name":"Hira Agha Shah","id":"700402208"},"message":"Thats funny;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-30T18:20:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"564429800274841","from":{"name":"Murtaza Juzer Marvi","id":"505498193"},"message":"Hi Raheel - Thanks for highlighting out these concerns.
