All in all I would give it a 6.5/10. The taste was good but the description I took on phone didn\u0027t match the cake.  It was a mousse kinda cake and I was expecting a sponge cake.\nRoom of customization was almost near to 1 as I couldn\u0027t get the icing written on top of the cake, neither on the cake disc. My only suggestion to the owner is to keep some room for customization and mention the weight of the cake(s) as it will help customers make the purchase decision.\n\nThe best thing about this cake was its rocher base and the chocolate puddings on top and on the side.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-06T13:06:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-06T13:06:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"779660436","name":"Sara Muzzammil"},{"id":"613626495","name":"Saim Mukhtar Hussain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjEzNjI2NDk1","before":"Nzc5NjYwNDM2"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_580860561965098","from":{"name":"Nida Khalil Khan","id":"100001177450324"},"message":"To all swotties!
