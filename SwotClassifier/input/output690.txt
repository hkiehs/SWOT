The owner insisted that I should have the Cheese Naan fresh from the Tandoor rather than doing a takeaway.  Had it fresh from the Tandoor, 20 minutes wait so the Naan could be prepared and boy it was so good that I decided to scrap the idea of takeaway and asked the owner to serve me the Qeema Naan also there.  The freshly baked Qeema Naan (available in both mutton and chicken) is probably the best available anywhere in town.  He also suggested at that I should try the Croissant Naan ( this will go great dipped in a karak doodhpatti).  Also tried a Aaloo Naan which was also terrific (picture posted) with a lovely filling of green masala and chillies with potatoes.
