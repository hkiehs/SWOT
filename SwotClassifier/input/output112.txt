My dad is on a wheelchair but hates being wheeled or helped up stairs or whatever. He cannot stand or move from chair to chair and HATES it when people have to help him around/pick up his chair etc.\nWheelchair friendly doesn\u0027t mean having an elevator, or providing a wheelchair (we carry one in the car), wheelchair friendly means the person should go around freely, independently, like we do, Alhumdulillah.\n\n3) Dolmen Mall is NOT wheelchair compatible. My dad drives. Once in the parking lot, there are no elevators. What ridiculous planning is this? The escalators are not built for someone on a wheelchair.\n\n4) Port Grand is also not wheelchair friendly. It has these ridiculous separations/gaps and weird stones in the middle of the plain ground. THAT isn\u0027t wheel chair compatible.\n\n5) All the ramps available at a thousand restaurants aren\u0027t really useful.

Yes the waiters were very helpful In that they scooted over the tables so that my mum could slide into one of the booths. However, there should be higher seating in the waiting area in addition to a ramp for wheelchair access (not sure if the extension has this facility). This suggestion is not limited to just ginsoy, but is a request to all restauranteurs who are reading this.
