Didn\u0027t know Olivetto also did a buffet type dinner.  Was really impressed.  The Lounge portion of Olivetto was reserved for the GT.  Choice of chicken cream and tomato soups followed by 3 starters (margarita pizza slices, cheese on crackers with olives and spicy prawns on toast) were passed around.  The buffet was awesome, mediterranean salad (amazing with sun dried tomatoes, feta cheese, olives), hummour in Mediterranean sauce, fillet of beef in pepper sauce, penne al arabiatta, prawn risotto, chicken in creamy mushroom sauce and Mediterranean rice. All the main courses were really delicious.  Desserts included cream caramel, italian bread pudding and vanilla ice cream. Olivetto did a great job.  It was one helluva buffet dinner.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-20T19:48:14+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-21T05:56:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"500293260","name":"Aamir Basrai"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1039048992","name":"Camilla Asmatullah"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nzc3NjQ3ODAy","before":"MTAwMDAyNjY4OTYxNDAz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"281285578589266","from":{"name":"ArtScene Galleries","id":"1463201564"},"message":"loved d food..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T19:50:09+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281287281922429","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"Great selection of menu, feeling hungry at this time after reading.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T19:53:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281288708588953","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"FF, maybe u can go to Olivetto and check out any leftovers.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T19:54:24+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281289541922203","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"AAM I don\u0027t expect leftover as Shahzad Artscene was also there ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T19:55:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281291298588694","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"The food was so yummy Farhan that Olivetto beats any Karachi eatery hands down.

The sleepy little nook of a restaurant in Zamzama (are there truly any other types) is still a quiet eatery and almost seems forgotten. Thyme has probably managed on its loyal clientele. \nI revisited the restaurant on a whim and found that it was still a delightful little place that has managed to serve good, though not exceptional, food. We started the meal with Couscous Salad with fried eggplant chips and Clear Chicken Soup with vegetables. The salad was a little bland and could have done with a drizzle of olive oil but it was a good start to the meal though the eggplant chips were a great touch. The Chicken Soup was also good but lacked the umami body usually associated with chicken soup in general as a comfort food; the chicken and vegetables were nice. For the main course we had the Tuscany Beef Fillet and Citrus Prawns which were as good as they sound and thankfully cooked well and not tough in texture. Surprisingly the roasted balsamic garlic served with the bread basket was what we enjoyed the most! Sweet, juicy garlic on not so fresh bread but we didn\u0027t mind eating it raw. \nIf Thyme concentrated on the little flourishes and added them to the menu as a whole I think the restaurant would be packed.\nRating: 3 out of 5\nHave you been to Thyme and what were your thoughts? Will you be giving it a go?","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-20T09:09:56+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-20T14:41:19+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"281021845282306","from":{"name":"Ahmed Shahnawaz","id":"100000759794024"},"message":"i am quite a thyme customer,have visited it often,i do like the food very much but i always find it empty,don\u0027t know why i know the owner as well,and i often ask him why is it empty,and says it happens,but it is a nice cosy place to eat","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T09:18:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281022635282227","from":{"name":"Omer Sattar","id":"100001643122805"},"message":"i go there often..  i really like the food","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T09:22:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281022945282196","from":{"name":"Sana Adnan","id":"891395441"},"message":"I love it too.

Even thu I can see many a things that people could have been highly critical over......esp the stale bread part. But it seems that you enjoyed the food and had a very open and positive attitude. That is What\u0027s missing in a lot of our highly critical reviews. People forget to have a good time and focus on just the negative. \n\nOn this note I hope the owners of Thyme are on the page or at least reading it. And will improve.
