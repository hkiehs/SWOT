Kindly note that although teriyaki has its own charm - it loses it when you have your starters (Lotus stalks - which were the saving grace btw  ) , Chicken starter (not palatable at all as it smelled of raw chicken and was drowning in teriyaki) Beef TERIYAKI burger, Chicken with rice (again in teriyaki) .... so by the end of it all.... we all vowed to stay away from anything remotely resembliing TERIYAKI!!!!!!!!!! \nHave also vowed to stay away from any place that serves a  SET menu - after my experience at Forty 4 (Valentines - for which Aman Virji kindly wrote and\nwanted to make amends but never called after asking for my number) And now Patio!!! \nLesson learnt!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-04T09:33:25+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-04T18:21:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"550658494","name":"Amna Hanif"},{"id":"507728929","name":"Sarah Sherazee"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA3NzI4OTI5","before":"NTUwNjU4NDk0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"513360102048478","from":{"name":"Danyal Achria","id":"582960575"},"message":"Aysha, we apologise if you did not have a positive experience and felt like there was teriyaki in everything you ordered but our set lunch menu has two items that have teriyaki, which both you ordered (chicken teriyaki and roast beef teriyaki burger) other then that not a single item contains the same sauce out of 16+ choices for the set lunch menu. If our set menu was mostly comprised of items with teriyaki sauce we would not survive more then a month in this cut throat business. Therefore when you make statements like 90% of our set menu has teriyaki your exaggerating and misleading other potential customers. I understand you did not like certain things you ordered which again I apologise for and hope you come back and try something different from our a la carte menu and specials menu. Thus when you post a comment atleast keep it factual instead of embellishing it like your writing a story. Our lotus and chicken glazed doesn\u0027t even have teriyaki sauce in it, so not sure why you have said that. Regarding the starter smelling raw, i will look into that once im back, as im not in karachi at the moment. Anyways we hope you try the patio in the future and have a better experience. Also judging a restaurant solely on their lunch deals is definitely not prudent.
