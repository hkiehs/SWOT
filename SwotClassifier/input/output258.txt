It is probably one of the few places in Karachi, which continues to innovate, and come up with new product offerings, compared to other places which don\u0027t get tired of serving mediocre done-to-death entrees at European prices.\n\nTried the Double Chapli Kabab Burger there, and it was a treat.  The Chapli Kababs were delish, and one doesn\u0027t feel bloated, even though they are fried.  The bun-patty (double) was optimal, and one could take a good juicy bite without worrying about a crumbling bun (which is often the case with many burgers).\n\nThe chatni on the side had the right amount of spice, and complemented the overall flavor of the burger.  The burger is in an experimental class of its own, so can\u0027t really be compared to other burgers available in the local, and international market.  Adding in some provolone (between the kababs), might accentuate the taste a tad bit more -- but that\u0027s just a personal preference.  Overall, a fantastic no-nonsense burger, and is definitely a bargain at PKR370!\n\nWe also ordered Penne Pasta, and well that was a disaster.  The pasta was floating in the sauce, and the flavor was just overpowering.  It was just a badly done dish -- perhaps, not a core competency, so should be avoided.  The ambiance is a bit too gloomy, but the flavor of the Chapli Kababs covers up for it!\n\nHighly recommended for the Chapli Kabab burgers.\n\nOverall rating -- 7.5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-24T10:22:23+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-24T14:03:33+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"541530612","name":"Mehru Ghazi"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"881200022","name":"Amna Alam"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"726076832","name":"Arifa Nasser"},{"id":"769030393","name":"Muhammad Danniyal Jafri"},{"id":"1510273456","name":"Daniyal Khalid"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"100001252885971","name":"Marium Sultana"},{"id":"1165524875","name":"Hiba Anwar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTE2NTUyNDg3NQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NzMyOTE3OTY4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"608929342491553","from":{"name":"Najm Ahmed","id":"885480695"},"message":"Yes I agree.
