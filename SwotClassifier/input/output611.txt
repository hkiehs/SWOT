We are organising Womens day event on 15th March. Our theme is to promote Female entrepreneurs and professionals. Our goal is to make such products and services providers available to working women which would make their life easier.  Home cooks, caterers who cater everyday dishes on daily basis to working professionals at home are needed. We will provide a stall for them and they will have the opportunity to market their talents to 100-120 ladies by handing out cards, menu cards or pamphlets. Any one interested, kindly inbox me.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-21T06:07:11+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-21T06:07:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"850315404","name":"Faiza Nathani Sagheer"},{"id":"793440366","name":"Amina Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzkzNDQwMzY2","before":"NTE4MzA4MDg2"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_508260412558447","from":{"name":"Zahoor Ahmed","id":"100002653854221"},"type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-21T05:54:53+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-21T05:54:53+0000"},{"id":"165861103465048_508259539225201","from":{"name":"Zahoor Ahmed","id":"100002653854221"},"type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-21T05:50:03+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-21T05:50:03+0000"},{"id":"165861103465048_508073959243759","from":{"name":"Vikki Mohsin","id":"557216100"},"message":"Any body visited the new Ginsoy extension ??\ntoo bad I am not in torn and missed the opening of my favourite restaurant..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-20T18:05:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-21T05:36:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"651674702","name":"Mohsin Baweja"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjUxNjc0NzAy","before":"NjUxNjc0NzAy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"508248852559603","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Haven\u0027t visited yet, though Ginsoy fans can go anywhere as long as they\u0027re served with Extreme Chinese I guess:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-21T04:54:01+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"508257112558777","from":{"name":"Batool Habib Curmally","id":"502436694"},"message":"Saw it from outside, it looked pretty awesome","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-21T05:36:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA4MjU3MTEyNTU4Nzc3","before":"NTA4MjQ4ODUyNTU5NjAz"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_508155729235582","from":{"name":"Mohammad Ahsan Dahar","id":"594590024"},"message":"want homemade achaar... please inbox details..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-20T22:27:17+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-20T22:27:17+0000"},{"id":"165861103465048_508097009241454","from":{"name":"Ismaa Khan","id":"728371533"},"message":"Beyond excellent food at Forty4 Restaurant, Al Fresco dining at it\u0027s best:) Beautiful weather, artistic ambiance, good company, prompt and courteous service and divine food.
