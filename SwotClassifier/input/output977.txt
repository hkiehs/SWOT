My mother and I are still in awe because it was such a brilliant experience!\nThe service was impeccable! Afroze Khan, thank you for being so courteous and helpful, it was a pleasure being around you :)!\nThe servers were at their best and timed our 3 course meal perfectly. Nothing was lacking :). \nOk so we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly with a 3 course meal which left us stuffed like Turkeys ourselves :). \nFor starters: Marg and Smoked Chicken split pizza and Artichoke and Spinach Dip.. What a brilliant start!! The pizza was the BEST I have had in town and mom agrees. And the dip was just to die for! All of this accompanied by their brilliant freshly baked bread basket and veggies with the most amazing sour cream dip!\nFor our main course we ordered 2 different Turkey dishes. The Classic Roasted Turkey and the Turkey Roulade. Both were absolutely superb! The trimmings were so fantastic that I really couldn\u0027t stop eating no matter how full I was. The stuffing in particular was amaaaaazing!! We got a heap of steamed veggies along with our meal. The french beans and broccoli completed the dish for me! Crisp and tasty!\nFor dessert we were thinking of having the Creme Brulee (because it\u0027s absolutely delicious) but decided to go with the Molten Chocolate cake instead since we hadn\u0027t tried that yet. And it was seriously the perfect, sweetest ending! Ooh dear was it good!!\n\nI just wish we had Christmas dinner 365 days round because I\u0027d make it a point to go once a week without fail. \nWhat a meal!!\n\nThank you for this brilliant addition to Karachi Afroza aunty!

The cream of asparagus soup  was absolutely divine and soul-satisfying. Then for the main, I ordered Fettucine Alfredo with grilled chicken and a creamy garlic sauce. Lovely, delicate flavor although I would have been happier if the chef had held back on the sauce a little. Sadly, as I\u0027ve been eating out way too much of late, decided to hold off on dessert this time, but am looking forward to a full, three-course, no-holds-barred meal at CBG the next time!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-07T10:42:55+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-07T20:56:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000238377520","name":"Zeeba Ansar"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTg0NjgyMjQz","before":"MTAwMDAwMjM4Mzc3NTIw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"291807607537063","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Naziha Syed Ali - Thank you for such lovely words, we are working on adding some new items to the menu as well - Looking forward to seeing you more often at CBG!!

My first reaction was like \"abay bohut dakhay hain aise dhabay\". (The same friend also told me that the group name stands for Single Women Over Thirty, reason enuff for me to join the group in the first place). \nLast few days i read so many posts raving about the food, i thought probably the owner has a lot of friends on the group who brags about his food. Khair, finally went to BOTS yesterday, since my kids wanted to have something prawny and it was on my way. We were in a hurry so i thought of grabbing prawn biryani for all of us but kids wanted something gravy so we ordered prawn karhai as suggested by the waiter. I also met Syed Ali Raza Abidi and introduced myself as a SWOTie, while he was doing something fishy. Watching the owner cook himself gave me a lot of assurance about the quality of meal. He seem to me like a nice guy, clean shaved, soft spoken, reasonably dressed, you know the kind of guy your wife wants you to be! \nGot the order in half an hour (good timing). The Karhai had a strong teasing aroma, tempting us while we were driving back home. Shared into 3 unequal portions (i got the least no of prawns;(, we were literally blown away by the karhai masala. The kids literally finished the meal in less than 30 minutes (a new home record) and asking for more! The only regret was the quantity we ordered wasnt enough. \nI dont usually say good things about food (accordingly to my wife the last time i complimented her was when she made Jans ke biryani) but BOTs far exceeded my expectations. To those you havnt tried, i will say what i was told, \"You Are Not A SWOTie if you never been to BOTS!\" \nEnough about BOTS, now can someone please tell if there are really any Single Women Over Thrity on the group?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-06T14:00:31+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-07T18:10:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"537680329","name":"Mohsin Siddiqui"},{"id":"193110460","name":"Mashal Mohammad"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"100002594564883","name":"Tania Ali Raza"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"},{"id":"752647175","name":"Kiran Haroon"},{"id":"726690443","name":"Danial Rizvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzI2NjkwNDQz","before":"NTM3NjgwMzI5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"291186784265812","from":{"name":"Kiran Haroon","id":"752647175"},"message":"Great mouth watering review, Aneek!
