Hifza Shah was sweet enough to offer us dinner anyway, but thats not something I do, so Hifza I will be visiting your restaurant soon, when i have a pocket full of money :)\n\nMoving on to where i ended up... Cafe Forty4.\n\nvery average experience. the food came really late. We ordered beef Carpaccio for starters, which was quite good. \nFor the main course we ordered beef tenderloin with chardonnay which was really really nice. Juicy succulent beef steak, between medium and well done. The sauce was delicious and mashed potatoes were yummy. The other entrée that I ordered was chicken roulade, which was very average. Stuffed chicken with a green sauce. I might not be very acquainted with this particular dish, but to me it tasted like haray masalay ki chicken that my mom makes at home :P\n\nThe worst part of the evening was when we ordered desserts. It was past 12 when we were done with our main course. The server came over and handed us the dessert menu. We took our sweet time deciding what to have, and when 10 minutes later we told him our order, he said that the kitchen is closed and they wont be able to serve dessert.\nWhat kind of place closes their kitchen without first asking the seated customers if they want anything else? And if they close their kitchen at 12 on a Saturday night, why did their server give us the desser menu at 12:15? \n\nAlso, they need to tell their servers to not hover so much around the table. We were seated in the non-smoking section and we were the only people there. And our server kept coming to the table after every 7-8min, asking us if everything was fine. It got extremely annoying after the third or fourth time. i didnt know how to tell him to stop :s\n\nOverall, a pretty disappointing experience at Café Forty4. Maybe I went with very high expectations. But the food was very average and the service was a bit annoying.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-04T07:14:56+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-04T10:09:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"777568273","name":"Adeel Badar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nzc3NTY4Mjcz","before":"Nzc3NTY4Mjcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"392118704172619","from":{"name":"Adeel Badar","id":"777568273"},"message":"this cafe forty4 is one of my faculty at cbm.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-04T10:09:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MzkyMTE4NzA0MTcyNjE5","before":"MzkyMTE4NzA0MTcyNjE5"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_391702594214230","from":{"name":"Shaikh Fawad","id":"694238742"},"message":"Chaat-leya!!!\nwent back to the Desi@Shahbaz. wow! after a hectic day of grocery shopping, muniza and i had the most refreshing pani-puri\u0027s (served w/ methi-chutney \u0026 Dahi sides) Aaloo Masala Chaat, and Channa Chaat...what can i say? or better yet, in the words of Adnaan Chaudhary i am \"Aaaaaall Praise!!\" and one only can, when u can taste all the fresh ingredients (cool summery herbs, earthy cumin, savory \u0026 balanced blend of spices) topped w/ cool creamy yogurt and coundn\u0027t stay away from those fantastic chutnies : )))))))))))))) we also split a most amazing Behari-boti/kabab roll. also ordered a large bottle of water, and 2 numkeen-Lassies all for just Rs.520;) which is awesome not bcoz the place is 5-starish, and always smells like citronella oil \u0026 has the cleanest bathrooms since BBQ2nite, but bcoz u can taste the fact that the gr8Food is made by real professionals who don\u0027t seem to have a bad day\u003cknock on wood\u003e sorry Nezihe Hussain, i hope your mother was worth it, i knw my Chaat experince sure was !)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-03T18:32:17+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-04T09:43:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"696432032","name":"Samiullah Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk2NDMyMDMy","before":"Nzc3NjQ3ODAy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"391750607542762","from":{"name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi","id":"1198831376"},"message":"Good review La Shaikh...
