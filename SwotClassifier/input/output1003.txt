Went there for dinner tonight after aages and lovvved every minute of it! The menu\u0027s improved since my last visit (which admittedly was months ago) as has the quality of food. The spinach and artichoke dip tho is as divine as ever and remains my favourite starter. Followed it up with Thai chicken which turned out sweeter than I expected at first bite but was delicious nevertheless. The quantity of rice they served with it was perfect for me (I prefer smaller portions) but wld probably not be enuff for most ppl. The chicken and veggie helping on the other hand is verry generous so I for one was quite full and satisfied :) Had the shikanjbeen to wash it all down and it reminded me that Koel does the best shikanjbeen in town. Packed with minty freshness! Since we were a group of 6 ppl in serious need of comfort food we ordered 3 desserts. But before that the waiter surprised us with cinnamon and cardamom tea on the house which was sweet of them. The hot beverage also helped make room for the desserts ;) Tried their banoffee pie for the first time and it is to die for! Scrrrumptous! The baked chocolate pudding was also perfect. Unlike most places where the pudding is overcooked and only a small trickle of chocolate sauce oozes out, this one was a perfect combo of a crisp crust that oozes a volcano of molten chocolate the minute u attack it. Delicious! Sadly their creme brulee was disappointing and not as good as Olivetto\u0027s. All in all though I enjoyed a lovely meal and ambience along with great service. \u0027Tis the season for Koel for sure I\u0027d say ;)","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-15T20:21:55+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-16T05:55:58+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzMzcxOTYzMA\u003d\u003d","before":"MTQ0MjI3MTY4Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"278496285534862","from":{"name":"Humayun Farooq","id":"648616217"},"message":"Wah wah","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-15T20:53:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"278707378847086","from":{"name":"Sadia Shah","id":"527315314"},"message":"Wah wah indeed:p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-16T05:18:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"278718375512653","from":{"name":"Ali Raza Pir","id":"515674780"},"message":"love koel","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-16T05:55:58+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mjc4NzE4Mzc1NTEyNjUz","before":"Mjc4NDk2Mjg1NTM0ODYy"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_278399442211213","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"My first time at a SWOT event..loved it!
