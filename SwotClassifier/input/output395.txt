Unfortunately, found a strand of hair. But i was quickly replaced with a new platter. The waiter was very apologetic. However, the staff made us feel very welcome, service was great, made sure we had a good appetite \u0026 quite large portions. Alas i was too full for another item esp. after iftari. There was no rush nevertheless no wait either \u0026 the food is scrumptious as always!","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-07-14T21:09:22+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-16T19:42:30+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002971695699","name":"Syeda Tehseen Zehra Naqvi"},{"id":"512050568","name":"Salman Shams Khan"},{"id":"719240590","name":"Omer Tayyab Khan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"746376004","name":"Sameen Shahid"},{"id":"645995992","name":"Rida Sadiq"},{"id":"571951019","name":"Muhammad Ahmad Azfar"},{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"741465157","name":"Kausar Fecto"},{"id":"686278548","name":"Junaid Saudagar"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"512071590","name":"Bilal Tariq"},{"id":"589563741","name":"M Junaid Chinoy"},{"id":"769030393","name":"Muhammad Danniyal Jafri"},{"id":"1707529920","name":"Amna Tariq"},{"id":"586485141","name":"Atif Shakeel Qureshi"},{"id":"1366360472","name":"Nadia Hasany Jafarey"},{"id":"751819688","name":"Erum Hamza"},{"id":"747329050","name":"Sehrish Hasan"},{"id":"501478359","name":"Mohammad Mikail Soomro"},{"id":"1033040222","name":"Zeeshan Iftakhar"},{"id":"514295643","name":"Zuraida Abbasi"},{"id":"100001165528409","name":"Aisha Talha Farooqui"},{"id":"512542175","name":"Nabiya Fahad Khan"},{"id":"100004861441059","name":"Ifrah Hameed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDA0ODYxNDQxMDU5","before":"MTAwMDAyOTcxNjk1Njk5"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_585757968142024/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dMTAwMDA0ODYxNDQxMDU5"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"585758724808615","from":{"name":"Ashfaq Parekh","id":"100001098310753"},"message":"That is y they r best","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-14T21:11:50+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"585758891475265","from":{"name":"Hira Zahoor","id":"100002332607255"},"message":"they worked for us...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-14T21:12:13+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"585763061474848","from":{"name":"Faryal Naeem Warind","id":"757255502"},"message":"Once they brought the wrong order of kababs and so we complained, they apologised, brought back the right order of kababs and a platter of complimentry kulfi (dessert) with \u0027sorry\u0027 written on the platter :) v good customer service :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-14T21:23:07+0000","like_count":22,"user_likes":false},{"id":"585763214808166","from":{"name":"Aamir Dayo","id":"100005421823588"},"message":"Yes, indeed.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-14T21:23:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"585765424807945","from":{"name":"Faizan Khan","id":"770383800"},"message":"The chef had hairs!!  lol \nKolachi is always good in service.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-14T21:29:50+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"585766338141187","from":{"name":"Arfa Abid","id":"539982540"},"message":"Kolachis service is always commendable.
