I have no intention of narrating a thesis or review laced with superlatives. For starters we had Hummus with garlic nan and Mulligatawny soup, the hummus was well flavored n blended, but the soup was too thick and need to be accurate this will like broth.Main course comprised of Shisk Touk,Afghani Kebab (chicken) Chicken Shashlik and Chicken Ginger. Shish Taouk was superb, very tender and succulent, Afghani Kebab was comparibly harder but great taste, Chicken Ginger is another fantastic dish, spicy but well flavored with lemon, always drain the excess oil and dice it with lemon, Whole wheat and Kandhari nans to accompany these were great. Only point which I noticed was staff has been changed and old faces are conspicious by their absence, new servers are a bit raw and it will take them time to get polished and reach the level of their successors. Last but not the least Berrylicious frozen yogurt in natural and chocolate flavor was heavenly and quite reasonable at 130 rupees. In the east bbq tonite is still the best.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-04-29T20:45:01+0000","updated_time":"2012-04-29T20:45:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ3Mjg1NTcz","before":"ODQ3Mjg1NTcz"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_369415003109656","from":{"name":"Saad Altaf","id":"568705668"},"message":"I am looking for some good blogs related to food and restaurants...

(Thanks Pooja Chaudhari)\nHere is a Science fair project presented by a girl in a secondary school in Sussex . In it she took filtered water and divided it into two parts. The first part she heated to boiling in a pan on the stove, and the second part she heated to boiling in a microwave. Then after cooling she used the water to water two identical plants to see if there would be any difference in the growth between the normal boiled water and the water boiled in a microwave. She was thinking that the structure or energy of the water may be compromised by microwave. As it turned out, even she was amazed at the difference, after the experiment which was repeated by her class mates a number of times and had the same result.\n\nIt has been known for some years that the problem with microwaved anything is not the radiation people used to worry about, it\u0027s how it corrupts the DNA in the food so the body can not recognize it.\n\nMicrowaves don\u0027t work different ways on different substances. Whatever you put into the microwave suffers the same destructive process. Microwaves agitate the molecules to move faster and faster. This movement causes friction which denatures the original make-up of the substance. It results in destroyed vitamins, minerals, proteins and generates the new stuff called radiolytic compounds, things that are not found in nature.\n\nSo the body wraps it in fat cells to protect itself from the dead food or it eliminates it fast. Think of all the Mothers heating up milk in these \u0027Safe\u0027 appliances. What about the nurse in Canada that warmed up blood for a transfusion patient and accidentally killed him when the blood went in dead. But the makers say it\u0027s safe. But proof is in the pictures of living plants dying!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-04-29T06:52:15+0000","updated_time":"2012-04-29T19:02:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"},{"id":"544715226","name":"Sairah Khalid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQ0NzE1MjI2","before":"MTAwMDAwMjQ1MDc0MTk1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"369046353146521","from":{"name":"Uzma Saeed","id":"1683849703"},"message":"scary!
