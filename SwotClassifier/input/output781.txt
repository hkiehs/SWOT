Not to mention tea, coffee, white rice, bread basket etc!\nThe food was cold and the taste was average nothing which would make u want to go back for seconds...the pasta sauce was thick and had dried up..fish was confusing..mustard chicken was half decent but then again it was a basic mustard sauce!
