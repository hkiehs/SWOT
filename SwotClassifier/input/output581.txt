I rate it above Al kebab.\nIt\u0027s located right opposite the Original Agha juice in Nazimabad (in the lane).\nOrdered the Gola Kebab, Tikka and the Bihari Kebab. Everything was superb but the bihari kebab was out of this world. Just melt in your mouth perfection. If you want bihari done right, that\u0027s your place. Unfortunately the place has no name.
