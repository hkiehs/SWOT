Although this time I thought the service had some flaws  but the food was good. We ordered Spicy Aromatic Chicken Dumplings, Laksa, Black pepper beef, Crispy Chicken with Plum sauce and Wok fried Noodles as a side. Laksa at Noodle House has always been out of this world, absolutely flavorsome! Black pepper beef was tender and delicious while crispy chicken with plum sauce had crispiness and sweetness which went well together. A bit more effort couldve been put into the noodles but they were okay. Dumplings were good too but although theyre cooked well they have this pinkish appearance which is unappealing. Portions were good for us. \nThe service lacked where they served us main course when we werent even done with our starters, the main course had to wait on our table and went cold as we got over with the starters. Also as the server took away our plates, he took my cutlery aswell. These are small mistakes but make an impact on the customer satisfaction.\nOverall a good experience, the drinks Mojito and Lychee Pine had a good visual but tasted ordinary. \n\nI feel people in Pakistan find it difficult to acquire authentic tastes as we are naturally inclined towards everything cooked well done, spicy and oily. But continental dishes taste good in their own authentic flavors. By this statement I do not mean to offend anyone I, myself have very desi taste buds but not every continental food can be maneuvered to suit our tastebuds.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-15T18:33:35+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-15T19:13:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001226932306","name":"Muntaha Khan"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"1405185438","name":"Tayyaba Hasan"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.
