Why do we fast? To cleanse ourselves and get the feeling which poor people go through who don\u0027t have much to eat, and Ramadan gives us the opportunity to do all this. \nHowever, I am unable to understand why people working in restaurants and cafe\u0027s introduce \u0027All you can eat\u0027 deals. Is the purpose of a fast to starve all day and then have a huge meal at sunset? We are required to fast, so are the poor people and we fast to understand what the poor go through when they don\u0027t have food to eat but can they suddenly afford a huge meal at sunset like us. When we starve all day, is that large pizza or barbeque platter or those huge burgers justified? Can these justify the purpose we aimed to fulfil the entire day.

Had some squash juices and milk roohafza on the table prior Iftar, the iftar menu was fine, later when it came to the mains that is when i started regretting LQ. The food variety was not big and it lacked quality and taste, opted for tempura prawns and there it lied a small prawn in the big oily crispy coating. Then went for some BBQ. It was so so, then found something with a name tag of Shahzada Salim Khas.. on my curiosity i took a bit and there it was Pasta Alfredo. Seriously did the mughals had Pastas at that time LOL. That is some serious Epic Joke. Out of all those dishes around this was re-named. Went on to Fish Tikka, too much salt in it with no such flavors. The chinese almost ended. Then tried Sajji, it did some justice compared to other food. It was later I shifted to Deserts and had some bit of various sweets. The Shahi Tukra had nothing Shahi in them !! The labe shereen was fine others were upto LQ expectations !! The food was seriously low quality and taste, with attentive service. Rs 1250/- per head exclusive drinks. Seriously it does not in any way does justice. Went to Kolachi a week ago and i Must say it was worth every penny. I would give LQ 2/10.
