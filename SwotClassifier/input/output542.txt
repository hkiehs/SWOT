I had been craving chicken all day hence decided to order Rowtisserie chicken, reason being I don\u0027t like Damascus\u0027s overly salted chicken and was not in the mood for Nandos. Also I had only ordered from Rowtisserie one time when they had opened and the chicken came in 1.5 hours and was dry despite that I thought I\u0027d give them another shot.\n\nI ordered the Rower\u0027s Meal II which included half a rotisserie chicken, Row sauce, Garlic sauce, Tabouleh, pickles, Pita bread, 2 sides of my choice and two drinks. I chose mash \u0026 gravy and hummus plus an additional heavy garlic sauce.\n\nThe order taker had told me 40 to 45 minutes for delivery so I expected at least an hour but to my surprise the food was delivered in 30 ! My grumbling tummy couldn\u0027t be more thankful.\n\nThe chicken was small but succulent, moist and not overly seasoned, just the right amount of spices gave it that wonderful flavour.  The mash \u0026 gravy was very creamy and delicious but I think the gravy could use beef stock in it. My favourite part was dipping the chicken in the Row sauce and then the garlic sauce both extremely flavourful....I\u0027m salivating just by typing this ! The Tabouleh was fresh and a perfect accompaniment to the meal. The Hummus was the only thing I didn\u0027t like, it was too pungent and not smooth in flavour, also I would have liked an olive garnishing on top. The pita was fresh, I gobbled it up with the extra garlic sauce I had ordered. I was left feeling happy and satiated.\n\nKeeping in mind three things, taste, quality and service, I give them 8.5 /10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-19T16:10:10+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-20T05:35:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"647150297","name":"Mehreen Faisal"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NjQ3MTUwMjk3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"543415832376238","from":{"name":"Kashif Malim","id":"766095724"},"message":"Do you have a link to their page or website?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:15:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543429935708161","from":{"name":"Sana Sultan","id":"1519922458"},"message":"https://www.facebook.com/Rowtisserie?fref\u003dts","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:22:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543430325708122","from":{"name":"Kashif Malim","id":"766095724"},"message":"Thanks Sana :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:24:01+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1519922458","name":"Sana","type":"user","offset":7,"length":4}]},{"id":"543435195707635","from":{"name":"Mohsin Makki","id":"667511058"},"message":"sana for how much?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:42:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543445595706595","from":{"name":"Sana Sultan","id":"1519922458"},"message":"1345/-","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T17:20:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543455882372233","from":{"name":"Mohsin Makki","id":"667511058"},"message":"not bad :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T17:53:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543752059009282","from":{"name":"Hassan Farook","id":"621215659"},"message":"as you have mentioned that you did skip 2 of your meals I am sure it would have tasted better","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-20T05:35:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNzUyMDU5MDA5Mjgy","before":"NTQzNDE1ODMyMzc2MjM4"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_542647565786398","from":{"name":"Hirah Sid","id":"514290400"},"message":"https://www.facebook.com/SmackinTreats\nTurn your High tea exciting!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-18T10:19:35+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-20T02:12:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001678476395","name":"Rimsha Khan"},{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"584642194","name":"Fatima Shafiq"},{"id":"600206252","name":"Madiha Shafiq"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"627817873","name":"Ayishah Sohail Siddiqui"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI3ODE3ODcz","before":"MTAwMDAxNjc4NDc2Mzk1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"543305532387268","from":{"name":"Abbas Farid","id":"688336352"},"message":"The look amazing....I am sure they taste equally good too  :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T13:02:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543344272383394","from":{"name":"Hirah Sid","id":"514290400"},"message":"Thanks :))","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T15:11:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543521515699003","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Wow so pretty","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T21:46:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543646275686527","from":{"name":"Hirah Sid","id":"514290400"},"message":"THanks Nezihe :))","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-20T02:12:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNjQ2Mjc1Njg2NTI3","before":"NTQzMzA1NTMyMzg3MjY4"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_543492325701922","from":{"name":"Alina Iftikhar","id":"517989587"},"message":"Damn.
