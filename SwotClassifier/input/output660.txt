So far, the online part was smooth even if it turned out to be inaccurate when they called me to confirm the order since it was the first one. The phone call was a little less encouraging but being an optimist, I am trying to remain positive and reserving judgement till the food arrives. \n\nThe problems I had were that the listed delivery charge was 100 and I was informed that since the food is delivered from Sindhi Muslim, it would be 200. When I pointed out that their order confirmation online should state the proper charge, I was informed that they have mentioned that delivery chargers can vary by area. Sure they can, but when you have my address including the area I live in, how hard is it to program your computer to reflect the actual delivery charge rather than have to call and check with me if I am willing to pay the extra 100 bucks. \n\nI was also informed that even though the online system lists the estimated time at 60 minutes, it would be up to 90 minutes. Again, I ask why the system is not accurate? The whole point of an online system is defeated if I need to provide decisions on the phone because then I might as well call them rather than waste my time online!\n\nFinally, while completely polite, the person on the phone was defensive and almost using an argumentative tone ... not sure how to describe it any better than that! Let\u0027s just say that I wasn\u0027t thinking how often I would order from Urbanite; rather I was thinking if I had made a mistake and should cancel. Unfortunately, Mariyam Masood wanted some mushroom soup and so my delivery options were limited so I figured I would see how this experience panned out even though I am not very hopeful!\n\nHowever, to be fair, I shall comment further once the food arrives ... hopefully well before 90 minutes because that would make it 11pm! Tick tock!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-11T16:43:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-13T12:54:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"631611761","name":"Adnan Zafar"},{"id":"504592087","name":"Kanwal Anes Ahmed"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE5MjM1ODcz","before":"NjMxNjExNzYx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"486322548085567","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"aagay ki kahani, what happened","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-11T19:48:16+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"486569064727582","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"And the rest of the story is soooooooo much better!

Its circular shape is representative of a wheel.  It became popular with riders on the Paris-Brest cycle race, partly because of its energy-giving high calorific value, and is now found in pâtisseries all over France.

I did like my burger and fries but did compare it to others in town that are similar. This is not fast food but it isn\u0027t a gourmet joint either! \n\nHowever, I am surprised at why people are making such strong negative statements about the place. If I go somewhere and there is a long wait, it is my choice to wait or not. From what I saw, they were trying hard to do well and in time, I think their service will catch up with their customer service goals. \n\nAlso, the prices have been targeted and that is really amazing to me since I don\u0027t know how much people expect to pay for their food! Fatburger isn\u0027t inexpensive but it is well in line with other comparable places with the addition of the unlimited refills on sodas.\n\nI completely respect the right of my fellow SWOT members not to like a place, the food they ate, the cost of the food, to share their experiences whether positive or negative and maybe to the extent of not recommend it to others. However, some of the language and characterizations of Fatburger are bordering on being offensive and that is against my perception of what this page is about. And some of the figures being quoted for comparison are not particularly accurate ... one has to be careful with stuff like that because people do rely on the information that is presented here.\n\nBe fair, kind and honest. The place hasn\u0027t been open long and is definitely facing teething issues because hordes of people are descending on them. I found the staff to be cooperative, pleasant and motivated even as they made their mistakes! In my humble opinion, Fatburger is getting a raw deal from some people because I think their expectations are unreasonably high and they get disappointed because, especially after a long wait, at the end of the day, it is just a burger! And yes, there are plenty around that are as good or better but there are also plenty that are not!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-12T09:22:43+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-12T19:47:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"638165637","name":"Feri Rawanian"},{"id":"888075011","name":"Nayyer Rauf"},{"id":"667831252","name":"Syeda Akefah Hashmi"},{"id":"736425186","name":"Maryam Zahoor Ansari"},{"id":"502191902","name":"Zaigham Hidayatullah"},{"id":"594302255","name":"Feroze Jamall"},{"id":"689535117","name":"Ahsen Wali Mohammad"},{"id":"579933313","name":"Ali Daudpota"},{"id":"615181836","name":"Wajeeha Rehman"},{"id":"579716133","name":"Syma Nizami"},{"id":"100002046384968","name":"Usman Daudpota"},{"id":"502194439","name":"Ayesha Ahmad"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"603490700","name":"Mariam Bilgrami"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"513232132","name":"Nazia Latif"},{"id":"553960553","name":"Salman Mukaddam"},{"id":"512864890","name":"Scidra Usman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEyODY0ODkw","before":"NjM4MTY1NjM3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"486580491393106","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Yes.
