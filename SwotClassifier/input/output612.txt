Had reserved a table at the Upper Deck of HLS which during this time of the year is the ultimate place to enjoy an evening.  Overdosed on the bread basket and the garlic butter which probably is one of the finest in town, the four of us finished something like six bread baskets.  For starters, SB \u0026 I both ordered the Smoked Salmon which was outstanding and FA \u0026 SZ had the Seafood Chowder.  Recommended Red Snapper to FA and he was pretty satisfied with it.  SB tried the Lobster Ala Marvi and he seemed happy although the serving size seemed to be an issue with him coz he had half of my Seafood Kat-a-Kat which was made to perfection with spice level that was just right for a dish like Kat-a-Kat.  ZS was the odd one out ordering some Chicken entrée  (though I recommended him to try the white snapper).  He didn\u0027t seem too happy with his choice.  Am quoting ZS from his fb profile \"Hook Line \u0026 Sinker.  Average food and pathetic dessert.  Wastage of money notwithstanding \"lovely\" hospitality\".  The Kiwi Mousse \u0026 Coffee Mousse were way below average and Zara Tareen was very kind enough to offer that the same will be taken off the tab, however, the credit card had already been charged so she texted me that the next around the desserts will be on HLS and they will be better ones.  Service was impeccable.  Ambience, one of the best you can find in Karachi.  Starters \u0026 Main Courses, top quality ingredients \u0026 lovely presentation.  HLS is all set to be the No. 1 restaurant of Pakistan.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-20T05:43:07+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-20T16:11:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"734560115","name":"Syed Masud Naqvi"},{"id":"714178973","name":"Fatimah Jameel"},{"id":"604074782","name":"Farheen Jeelani"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"100003784320529","name":"Shahzad Saeed"},{"id":"1039106808","name":"Shaban Butt"},{"id":"100000018754614","name":"Faisal Anwar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwMDE4NzU0NjE0","before":"Njg3MjU1NDgy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"507894409261714","from":{"name":"Shamsi Zia","id":"1367979764"},"message":":)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T06:21:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"507894435928378","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Who is ZS!!!!!\n\nMystery Man.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T06:21:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"507894799261675","from":{"name":"Faisal Anwar","id":"100000018754614"},"message":"I had a great time, lovely place I was impressed by the perfection on the restaurant outlay and ambiance ...... enjoyed company of friends...I guess one of the few places where one could spend quality time with friends and have a good relaxing laugh..................","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T06:23:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"507897122594776","from":{"name":"Shamsi Zia","id":"1367979764"},"message":"No doubt , ambiance  and hospitality of HLS is gr8 but seefood at BOTS is the best.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T06:27:51+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"507897422594746","from":{"name":"Shamsi Zia","id":"1367979764"},"message":"Agree with FA to the the extent that \" one of the few places where one could spend quality time with friends and have a good relaxing laugh..................ONLY","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T06:28:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"507905109260644","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"ZS is Shamsi Zia Doc.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T07:01:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1367979764","name":"Shamsi Zia","type":"user","offset":6,"length":10}]},{"id":"507919999259155","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Shamsi Zia, guess your are missing the Natural \"Blonde\", I mean the Suicide \"Blonde\" Chutney of BOTS.
