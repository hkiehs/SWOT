Ordered the King Kong, half pepperoni and half new york special. Very very disappointed with what we got. Had asked for hot flavour, got nothing close to hot. It was very mild and sorta bland. Lacked a lot of the usual pizza seasonings..not a food expert so cant name what seasoning but have had enough pizzas to know this one lacked that thinggg. Asked for beef pepperoni, PRETTY SURE they sent chicken. It was too pink to be beef..and didnt taste like it would be beef. The person taking my order said the new york special has chicken sausages,  and some seekh kabab chunks and one more thing..but ours just had some chicken cubes. Im guessing they were tikka or something. \n\nThe pizza was just plain BLAND. Guys work on your flavors!\n\nNot pleased at all and i think ill be ordering 14th street or stone baked the next time anyone wants pizza at my place! \n\nKudos!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-11T16:51:35+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-12T02:39:21+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"396341877083635","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Maleeha Jawaid drop these guys, try Pizzo, you won\u0027t ever order from anywhere again, quality driven Pizza.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-11T18:20:15+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"785615314","name":"Maleeha Jawaid","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]},{"id":"396368410414315","from":{"name":"Sarah Ashraf","id":"643405172"},"message":"they have the worst marinara sauce ever, even ketchup would taste better if used in place of it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-11T19:14:48+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"396370117080811","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Please.
