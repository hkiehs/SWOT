Fattoush Salad: must clarify all \"preconceived notions\" aside, the fattoush was as authentic as i have loved it for 18 years, until.... the pomegranite juice sweetness kicks in. Thank heavens its a mild presence so of the entire bowl the sweetness hit in bare few bites instead of a presence in the entire salad. Which means whenever there was no pomegranite juice (which fell to the base of the bowl\n: proving it was fresh juice) the salad was DELICIOUS.  \n\n2. Gourmet Fries: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10151603200767065\u0026set\u003dpb.185841542064.-2207520000.1365953466\u0026type\u003d3\u0026theater  now when i saw this picture posted on Thursday the temptation to hit LP multiplied. I dont know why, my folly or the \"seeing is not believing\" or \"aankhon ka dhoka\" for some odd reason i thought the image portrayed curly fries. They weren\u0027t . they were typical fries which LP\u0027s next door neighbour serves. the fries had a sprinkle of turkey bacon chips, a drizzle of cheese/ white sauce and bare greens. Erm. Again. i was only disappointed because i was expecting teh picture. To have a platterful of fries is, otherwise, never a complaint. \n\n3. Banh Mi: The Vietnamese Sandwich. The sandwich was lovely, slightly bland, and quite tasty ONLY till you were not expecting a \"vietnamese\" flavour. now. I love Far Eastern Food, and Vietnamese and Thai are among favourites. i may not be a chef, but i know my flavours. and Sadly. Tthis sandwich, delicious as it was, lacked two things:\ni. original vietnamese flavour. could taste no sweetness/ saltiness/ sour acidity or anything. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_cuisine. it lacked flavour. period. if ntohing, it essentially needed lemon and chilli punch, and some spring onions. \nthe baguette was filled with very moist melt-in-your-mouth chicken pieces, plenty of coriander leaves, some mayo and other julienned veggies. On its own, without the \"vietnamese\" description it was good. quite good. except for the lack of vietnamese flavour and well.. teh sad second thing im about to point out:\nii: first bite you take and you can get an aroma and flavour. a flavour we all know very well. the biggest sadness: the bread/ baguette tasted like a pure bun kebab bun. \n\nBut without the description (bun kebab flavour of baguette notwithstanding) the sandwich was quite nice, on its own. the feta cheese salad on the side with cherry tomatoes: too refreshing. just yum. \n\n4. Drinks: DELIGHTFUL. i. Love absolutely love the diner sized glasses and helpings. The Cold Coffee/ Coffee Frappe was marvellous. A perfect blend of chilled, creamy but not rich or heavy, flavoured aromatic coffee and thickness was just beautiful. The other drink: Raspberry Lime was simply pure summer drink. \n\nOverall:\n-  the helpings are rather, just a tinsy winsy bit, small for the prices. fattoush salad for 375 is a bit steep, as was the fries for 280 with the toppings (to make them gourmet they need a lot more). sandwich for 450 was also slightly small, but similar prices are offered at other eateries so... thats quite a few who need to get teh price-quantity element right. \n- Presentation was good. Im still jaw dropped at teh diner feel of the drinks. lovely tall milkshake diner glasses. for 300 and 330 and the punch of flavour its all so delightful.  fries came on a platter. sandwich came on a thick wooden board atop butterpaper. \n\nwill i go back? hell yeah for those drinks and the fattoush: oh yeah.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-14T15:53:56+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T16:55:30+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"620145354","name":"Bina Saeed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjIwMTQ1MzU0","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"540184456032709","from":{"name":"Bina Saeed","id":"620145354"},"message":"im hungry","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-14T16:00:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"550141611703660","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"here you go Madiha Sultan Tai","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-29T16:55:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"24440","name":"Madiha Sultan Tai","type":"user","offset":12,"length":17}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTUwMTQxNjExNzAzNjYw","before":"NTQwMTg0NDU2MDMyNzA5"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_550130631704758","from":{"name":"Nausheen Abedin","id":"100002017413631"},"message":"Just read the review by Abid Merchant about the choc gellato from Lals and called up my hubby and told him to get it from Lals on the way home and am in choc heaven at the moment.............

Wanted to try the brownie but ended up with the fruit salad which was actually a fruit chaat. Will try the brownie next time.

Mirage is the only buffet themed restaurant at Do-Darya and is located right next to Kolachi. The ambience is nothing to write about as its almost the same as Kolachi, Charcoal, etc. We booked the whole upper deck unanimously for the view and later regretted the decision as the main food stations were downstairs.\nThe food stations are divided into 3 areas. The main food station is at the entrance while the BBQ section is at the upper left corner of the restaurant. The dessert and salad bar is in the top right corner.\nFor the price (Rs. 1000 per person inclusive of 1 soft drink) the food was very good. There were fresh batairs (better than Lal-Qilas), fried prawn tempura, Chicken Biryani, Goan Fish Curry, Chapli Kabab, pani puri are just some of the dishes that were tasted. The highlights however were the BBQ and the live chicken Karhai. The BBQ consisted of Chicken Malai Boti, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Chicken Tikka and Beef Namkeen Boti. The Malai Boti was succulent (but a little sweet for my taste) while Reshmi Kabab and Tikka were awesomely cooked (and Thank God not overcooked)  bu the Beef Namkeen Boti stole the show as it literally melted in our mouths.\nThe Karhai also has 4 varieties namely Peneer White, Peshawari Red, Green Masala and Namkeen Red Karhai. All four varieties were delicious and much better than what Kolachi serves.\nThe let down at Mirage were the salad and dessert station due to same variety as other buffets and also fried fish and the pasta dishes.\nOverall we really enjoyed our food and had a fantastic evening. Best part was that there was no hassle from the waiters or the mangers to clear the table (like they do at Kolachi \u0026 Ginsoy).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-27T18:52:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T09:29:10+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"736425186","name":"Maryam Zahoor Ansari"},{"id":"772910592","name":"Shyam Sunder"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"100000226962956","name":"Sumiaya Arif"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"711050864","name":"Abdul Raheem Khan"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"NzM2NDI1MTg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"548935991824222","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Aaquib Arif","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-27T21:28:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"549210141796807","from":{"name":"Zarfras Siddiki","id":"100003898006618"},"message":"seems they(Kolachi and Ginsoy) are quite busy in their business and they care for walk in customers,to avoid waiting in queue,,caring for customers by Kolachi and Ginsoy thats good,,","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T08:19:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549233218461166","from":{"name":"Muhammed Umer Mulla","id":"595408686"},"message":"Well yes but what if you are in thr middle of a meal and the bill is presented to you or when you try to relax the waiter constantly remind you to clear the table as they have a big cue....I mean can\u0027t they wait for say 5 mins","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T09:48:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549380488446439","from":{"name":"Sumiaya Arif","id":"100000226962956"},"message":"I second that muhammed umer mulla","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T14:42:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549876995063455","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"5-7 Mins should be max before which the Bill sould be asked for \u0026 settled.
