Adjustments can be made easily if so much space is not needed. And rent is also negotiable and will be decided according to space requirements.

Ok so I haven\u0027t said this on SWOT yet but despite the good reviews I\u0027d seen for CBG I just could NOT make myself go to the zamzama location ever since it opened cos of the really really awful experience I\u0027d had at CBG while they were in the old clifton location. But this Friday I finally went to check out CBG for lunch with some colleagues. First impressions: Liked the decor and the manager as well as waiters were VERY courteous and helpful. The herb bread when it arrived was hot and smelled awesome so I was expecting a great experience to follow. However the bread crust was sadly hard as a ROCK and totally not fun to eat cos it was clearly overdone. Followed this with roasted garlic tomato soup which was very good and full of flavour. For the main course I ordered the Grilled chicken with dijon mustard sauce which was ok. The creamed potatoes on the side were perfectly done as were the veggies and the presentation was excellent. The sauce could have been better tho and I felt the flavour was a bit too mild. Overall tho it wasn\u0027t bad. One of us ordered the khau suey and she reported they were quite good so that deserves mention. All in all I\u0027d give my experience a 6 out of 10. Not awesome but not too bad either.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-24T13:40:10+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-25T07:10:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcwMTAwMTk4","before":"NjcwMTAwMTk4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"403359533048536","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Sumera Nizamuddin thank you..wont comment on your first experience because we are over and done with but let me tell that place was really close to our heart and its sudden closure had a terrible impact on us..with regards to your experience there it must have been an early day of our opening, but the kind of admiration and love that place had generated with in a period of six months of its operation - its only because of that place we are still around   ...and now coming to your recent experience..please please you should have returned the bread..and roasted garlic being mild..have noted..actually roasted garlic has a very strong taste and aroma, chefs recommend all over that we need to keep the flavours mild because of its extra strong aroma but have decided that from now onwards the front line staff to ask customers they would like extra garlic in your sauce..this would do away with the complaint..hope it helps..thanks anyways and looking forward to seeing you soon!
