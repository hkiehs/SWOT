You will find a select variety of similar dishes at The Pakistani (Sherato) and Dumpukht (Marriott) albeit in a limited version. Overall, Karachi does not have too many North Indian/Mughlai food places that are abundantly found in other parts of the world, especiialy UK, Europe, North America and the Middle East. Pakistani food is more onion/tomato based that is grounded in ghee for flavor whereas a lot of North Indian cuisine is texture-based and uses rich thickeners like fresh cream, dried fruit pastes and yogurt as well as pureed forms of vegetables i.e. spinach, palak, onions are usually pureed to create a thick aromatic curry. Some of the dishes you maybe able to find at Nawab would include Chicken Makhni (Indian style), Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Kashmiri, Mutton Roganjosh, Vegetable Makhni, Palak Paneer, Palak Kadai and Dal Makhni (with red beans: rajma) to name just a few. Also, at The Pakistani you can request the chef to make a dish of your choice that\u0027s not on the menu and usually he\u0027ll fix you something custom to your taste buds (esp if it\u0027s a weekday and there aren\u0027t too many people around).

The oldest and most famous was United Bakery,Periera bakery(famous for its coconut macroons) the Fresco bakery (President\u0027s in laws) Flurries and Blue Ribbon Bakery. Today we have several new players in the run starting with the run in the mill day to day bakeries examples are Mahmood sweets, Sony sweets and bakers,Ideal bakers top notch or high end we have Hob Nob, Pie in the Sky, Bravo, Neenis, Red Riding Hood, Torte Pasticceria,Lals Patisserie, La Farine,Espresso Gloria Jeans, then their is Cakery which was originally a home based bakery which progressed and today has its own outlet and a whole army of home based bakers, enterprising young and mature ladies who made their mark in the field of baking. Now the crux of this discussion is how much in your opinion should a cake cost?? How much are consumers willing to pay for a premium cake? Current per pound rates range from btwn Rs. 500-650-750- to 1000. Cakes have to be ordered in advance and cash advance has to be paid, a few years ago a friend running a bakery stated it cost 50% less but now the cost of the main ingredients milk, eggs, butter, icing, packaging and all other related costs have increased in a big way, but so has competition, as this page has several well know home based bakers and they will testify to the fact that due to cut throat competition they have to slash their profits while they work over time and hire extra labor to meet their clients orders on time. So now we should be able to do justice and decide as to what should a reasonable 5Ib cake cost? 500 per Ib or 750Ib? One new entrant on Zamzama shocked quite a few, they quoted 3000 ++ for a 4Ib cake, wow, that\u0027s like secret recipe which charged astronomical prices but crashed and burned in no time when they quoted these bombastic prices, so are we going to see more CAKE WARS in the the coming days with more new players emerging? Home based bakers dominating the scene or commercial entities, let\u0027s get some interactive and truthful comments.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-26T20:44:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-28T15:16:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"505055634","name":"Umme Ifrah Arif"},{"id":"1316130943","name":"Madiha Gillani"},{"id":"100003756103781","name":"Asif Jamil Ansari"},{"id":"1291009466","name":"Shahzar Pervaiz"},{"id":"515063254","name":"Kashish Ahmed"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"690822119","name":"Saniya Abdul Qadir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjkwODIyMTE5","before":"NTA1MDU1NjM0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"624856717565482","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"3000 for a 4lbs is not shocking.
