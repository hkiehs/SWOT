Throngs of people, self service, great toppings, nice flavours but again the after taste, less yoghurt and more flavour. Slightly chemical and synthesized flavour. Price points are ridiculous.\n\n3.

Goes well with the Jasmine Rice. \n\nThai Khao Suey: a great spicy twist blending Khao suey with Paad-Thai. \nSteamed Jasmine Rice: No complaints. \n\nPrawn in Tamarind Sauce: Haven\u0027t quite tried anything like it before but an excellent complement to your meal. It was spicy though.  \n\nAssorted Sushi and Maki:\n\nThis included Tuna, Pink Salmon, Crab Sticks and Prawn. The Maki included California Maki, Spicy Tuna and some Deep Fried Maki. \n\nI have never had deep-fried Maki before but it is excellent and a must-have. Another must-have is the Bulgogi.\n\nThe food was sent fresh to my home in KDA-1 and travelled well and the packaging and aesthetics left no room for complaints. General portions of wasabi, pickled ginger and soy sauce complemented the meal well. \n\nTHE UPPER-CRUST:\n\nPhilly Steak Sandwich : The beef was tender and I loved the panini and the cheese. The caramelised onions are always welcome in liberal portions and there are no complaints there. The beef did, however, require a little more seasoning in terms of salt and pepper.  \n\nSpaghetti Bolognese: Tasted perfect but the spaghetti seemed to be a little broken and I had to season it with parmigiano and salt n pepper. Overall the basic flavour was reminiscent of any Italian household / home-made bolognese. So no complaints.  \n\nCroissants: That\u0027s for breakfast tomorrow morning. I am sure it won\u0027t disappoint.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-14T20:54:26+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-16T20:07:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000921262643","name":"Kanwal Irfan"},{"id":"567197680","name":"Seema Mustafa"},{"id":"617680709","name":"Fatima Ali Rizvi"},{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"676000707","name":"Tasneem Murtazaalibhai"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"599235022","name":"Sadaf Imam"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"780381887","name":"Samar Husain"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"501859943","name":"Aamina Jahangir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAxODU5OTQz","before":"MTAwMDAwOTIxMjYyNjQz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"379226758795147","from":{"name":"Aamina Jahangir","id":"501859943"},"message":"lol same routine for me today!
