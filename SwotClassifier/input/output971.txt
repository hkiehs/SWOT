The food mentioned needs a review......\n\n1) Belgian Chocolate - FroYo - hands down the best thing introduced to Karachiite. I was an avid fan of FroYo even before Pinkberry came on the scene. NO one does frozen yogurt esp chocolate like TUC. There was mango - which I didn\u0027t try. (haven\u0027t sampled it yet either) \n2) Strawberry Gelato - flavour, texture, smoothness, ooohhhh factor (8/10 - would have been 10 if it was Raspberry)\n3) Vanilla Gelato - (6/10 there was something not upto the mark on the aroma. Last time I could feel the vanilla just by sniffing it.)\n4) Hazelnut (sampler) for the friend - she was blown away by the hazelnuttiness of that one bite.\n5) the best tasting chilli poppers in town. I had HOT melted cheese pouring down, I actually burnt my Foot. Discussed the thickness of the bread crumbed coating - I suggest a batter like they use on Corn dogs in California. \n5) the thin crust pizza - pesto with brie. I think there was smoked chicken too and olives. But sheer heaven. Next time I gotta try the blue cheese one (Nats doesn\u0027t like BC)\n7) roast beef wasabi sandwich - beef cooked to perfect tenderness. Wasabi tamed down for the local palate....(Hav Joe - its The Upper Crust.....kindly only cater to those who can handle it) I want my hot wasabi. And yeah the multi grain Bread made the sandwich a little dry.\n8) Grilled Chicken Sandwich - don\u0027t eat chicken if I have a choice - but the panini too was a little dry. The chicken was great would have been happy to have died for this sandwich. \n9) coffee - always a pleasure - great blend.\n\nHav Joe some of us plan to wake up on sunday for Naashta.

In starters, the calamari was stale and not crunchy as usual, the salads lacked seasoning and were dry, only wontons were the saviours. In main course, the spicy lemon fish was bland, the shrimps were overcooked, the glass noodles tasted really odd with only dominant red chilli flavour, spicy red chicken \u0026 sweet \u0026 sour chicken were only decent entrees.
