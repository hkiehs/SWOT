The wait stretched to 15 minutes and the line stretched by a further 10 persons behind me, on to the road. At this point a couple of people left the line and I asked the guard how much longer, to which he replied \"Abhi to jamaat khari hee nahee huee, time lagayga\" pointing to the adjacent masjid. Not wanting to wait any longer, I left. Suggestion: Whereas I (or the customers) may understand that you want to close shop and attend prayers, and if this will take 30 mins end to end, just say so! No point in saying 10 mins and keep customers hanging. \n\nTook the car around the block to find Big Thick Burgers and placed my order there.

All praises to them. I have witnessed myself people coming to Burger Shack and due to namaz break they also went and offered their prayers (by jamaat) which they wouldnt have otherwise. Yes its a very common practice in Saudia Arabia and if we can have a similar practice here i dont see any reason to be so frustrated and crib about it. We say its a free world so its their choice that they want to practice something they believe in. All said and done i need to mention here if they say its a 10 minutes break it should be 10 minutes only. I agree with Ozair here that this is certainly wrong to make a customer wait for 30 mins if its mentioned 10 minutes on the screen. I will surely point this out to the management on my next visit to one of the best burger joints in the city.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-01T09:36:47+0000","like_count":10,"user_likes":false},{"id":"612550322129455","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"I am actually glad they are practicing this, it will indeed bring barakha in their business!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-01T09:46:01+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"612570442127443","from":{"name":"Nasim Ahmad","id":"1343979604"},"message":"I am not exactly a spiritual person and don\u0027t like to comment on religious aspects (especially mixing religion with burgers) but happy to say that Mashallah I have not missed a single namaz since age 15 (I\u0027m 45 now...) I have not had the pleasure of visiting BS yet, but I admit that if I did and had to wait like Ozair that would be a discomfort and we know that Islam and its worship came not for the purpose of being a discomfort to others but a convenience. If BS is really pukka on the namaz thing (and every Muslim should) they should do it in a way where say half the staff can offer namaz while the other half are attending the customers, and when they finish they can return to work while the other half offers theirs.

We have always acknowledged that we use MSG. There is a long list of ingredients that customers ask  us to omit. There are people who are intolerant to ingredients like salt, sugar, onions, cabbage, carrot, oyster sauce, fish sauce, chillies, nuts, mushrooms, corn and the list goes on and on. It is practically impossible for the order taker to ask for every possible ingredient which the customer may not like. Hence it is  always best  to inform the eatery about your preferences while placing order.  We don\u0027t keep anything prepared. Every thing is prepared after we receive the order hence it is very easy for us to prepare your order any which way you like.
