Nezihe Hussain I like the \"Think before you SWOT\" rules and it is great to find pages like yours that promote Karachi and it\u0027s restaurants.  I live in North America and nothing like the restaurants in Karachi are present here.  In fact Indian and Pakistani restaurants have a bad name here for dirt and unhygienic methods.  It is with great joy when I found a review on one the restaurants in Karachi so I hope you do not mind if I place it here.  Keep up the great work!!  \n\nThis review was done by someone named: Azam Sultan Ahmed:\n\nLet me warn you this is going to be a long review, so be prepared. This evening I visited Thyme restaurant which is tucked away on 1st Commercial Lane Zamzama for a meal. The first impression when you enter the restaurant is of a homely and artistically done up place with plenty of paintings, it is a cozy and manageable place with capacity for seating 30 diners on the 1st floor. It was a pleasure meeting Mr. Haider Ghulam a seasoned professional, an upright and hard working young man who has 22 years of practical experience under his belt both here as well as abroad, he along with his brothers and a dedicated team have run the place very efficiently for the last six years. Like all restauranteurs Thyme has weathered the storms but never given up and continues to face challenges even today but Haider and his team face them with courage and bravery. Haider has started from grass root level and has a varied experience which helps him to understand the business better than others. \n\nFirst we were served a warm bread plate with butter and garlic in sauce. Starters were grilled calamari garnished with basil leaves, a heavenly zesty sauce and Stuffed Mushrooms with Crab Meat, both the starters were simply divine and tasted excellent. \n\nMain Course I had Tuscany Roast Fillet of Beef with Blue Cheese sauce served with Risotto and shaved Parmesan, medium well, the meat was tender, juicy and well flavored, my better half had Chicken with creamy green peppercorn mustard and fresh herb sauce, the fusion of herbs and peppercorn made the flavor a class of its own.This was accompanied with plain rice and sauteed veggies.\n\nFinally by the time desert came we were quite full, this was a surprise as we were not told what it would be, it was the all time favorite Bread pudding and as Haider described that the Bread Pudding makes space for itself, now this was innovation at its best, the bread pudding had a scoop of ice cream sitting on top of it and was served warm, freshly made and very tender, wow, seeing is believing, words cannot describe this desert and below the bread pudding was a generous amount of sweet toffee sauce which was a complete food coma for desert lovers\n\nThyme restaurant i am compelled to give you a 10/10, you have passed on all counts, service, quality, quantity, flavor, presentation,ambiance. I knew i was forgetting something, the choice of music was superb with some old tracks which were soothing. Thyme is a great place for ladies lunches, corporate meetings or GT\u0027s, it is highly recommended, plus they do outdoor catering for small and large groups and even cook at your house for small GT\u0027s and come with their stuff and clean up your place before leaving, so logistically they are spot on. Well done Haider Ghulam and the team Thyme, you guys rock, i feel proud that we have people who are hard working, dedicated and enthusiastic about your job as you in Pakistan. Continue like this in future and you will become even more successful. Thank you Haider and team Thyme, well done!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-16T23:12:36+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-18T03:52:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"698885102","name":"Aamir
