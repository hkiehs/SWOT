Though the food was good as always, it was a horrible experience otherwise. First of all, the person that took the order was least bothered and seemed half asleep to me actually which turned out true later on. Though I spelled out the name of the street to him twice, he still got the address wrong and which resulted in the food coming after over an hour and a half hour instead of 45 minutes. And when I called after over an hour to ask where the food is, the guy was still completely least bothered and said it\u0027ll be there soon and it got there after a further half hour. When we opened the bag, we discovered the sauces had not been tied with a rubber band and had exploded, soaking all the boxes. Furthermore, they got the order wrong by giving us chicken with almonds and pineapple instead of chicken with baby corn and mushrooms. NEVER EVER getting food from them delivered ever again for sure.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-26T10:41:52+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-26T15:05:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"519300031","name":"Madeeha Zaeem Hanafi"},{"id":"100000226962956","name":"Sumiaya Arif"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTgzNDQ2OTQ4","before":"NTE5MzAwMDMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"478420728875749","from":{"name":"Sameer Beg","id":"583446948"},"message":"they r this drunk at their outlets too","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-26T11:08:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"478428925541596","from":{"name":"Urbanite Pk","id":"100003613396124"},"message":"Next time order Ginsoy via Urbanite Pk and let us worry about getting the food to you within the hour instead :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-26T11:39:37+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100003613396124","name":"Urbanite Pk","type":"user","offset":27,"length":11}]},{"id":"478431225541366","from":{"name":"Noor Un Nisa Daudpota","id":"100001132050300"},"message":"\u003dp","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-26T11:48:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"478437568874065","from":{"name":"Marvi Shah","id":"522705412"},"message":"Noor, I hate you -_-","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-26T12:12:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100001132050300","name":"Noor","type":"user","offset":0,"length":4}]},{"id":"478440322207123","from":{"name":"Noor Un Nisa Daudpota","id":"100001132050300"},"message":"\u003dp","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-26T12:21:37+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"478462365538252","from":{"name":"Marvi Shah","id":"522705412"},"message":"I\u0027m glad someone actually got back to us after reading this post :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-26T13:30:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"478464815538007","from":{"name":"Noor Un Nisa Daudpota","id":"100001132050300"},"message":"\u003dp","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-26T13:38:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"478496888868133","from":{"name":"Teamginsoy Ginsoy","id":"100004017507423"},"message":"Dear Marvi Shah, We again apologize for delivery.
