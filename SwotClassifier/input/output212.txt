When I noticed the \u0027moustache\u0027 on the valet counter, pulled down my window to ask and was reassured that it was indeed the place. \nThe only thing that had any semblance to signage was a giant moustache on the boundary I noticed. It wasn\u0027t even lit. \n\nThe cafe had a nice courtyard outside for shisha lovers. Go straight in and you find a cafe with interiors with a \u0027little bit o this, little bit o that\u0027. \nWallpaper showing tea and traditional art, traditional desi style chairs, American style baristas and open counters preparing beverages - it\u0027s hard for a an average Pappu to fathom. I have to admit I love the concept and idea of the entire cafe - putting it simply - it\u0027s like having anda paratha with a cup of latte. But it\u0027s a little premature and obscure for everyone beyond the 0.1% of the market that it will cater to. \n\nThe menu looked great and had a few funny entrees including \u0027besharam topless burger\u0027 that threw us into fits of laughter. We only ordered beverages. The service was slow and the waiters were finding it hard to keep pace with the orders as you could see demanding celebrities around getting all the attention. However, the owner made it up with his considerate service and was very kind to offer gulab jamuns on the house. \n\nI had ordered peach ice tea to which the waiter returned with lemon ice tea, apologising that peach syrup had run out. So my ice tea was on the house. Yay! :)\n\nLove the small touches around like the moustache attached on my straw. Really added a nice touch.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-10T03:41:40+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-10T17:53:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"530060365","name":"Abdul Wajid Qureshi"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"609791225","name":"Afrah Jamal"},{"id":"683312282","name":"Misbah Zafar"},{"id":"522570731","name":"Hammad Ahmed Virk"},{"id":"617680709","name":"Fatima Ali Rizvi"},{"id":"100002850760185","name":"Nayab Ali"},{"id":"1822691694","name":"Khaula Rizwan"},{"id":"559881298","name":"Nadia Mahasin"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"745095793","name":"Sara Nasir"},{"id":"1292968825","name":"Kanwal Shahbaz"},{"id":"716107438","name":"Hira Zindani"},{"id":"508081630","name":"Maha Anwar"},{"id":"48921867","name":"Anum Shahid-Ahmed"},{"id":"521150323","name":"Roshni Zahra Jafri"},{"id":"707770900","name":"Naveen Saeed"},{"id":"590285082","name":"Sabeen Faruqui"},{"id":"751030900","name":"Zoha Manzar"},{"id":"100002542668092","name":"Shahtaj Khan"},{"id":"1127004759","name":"Tooba Ganatra"},{"id":"1526743161","name":"Hameer Rehman"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAyMzgxNTMxMA\u003d\u003d","before":"NTMwMDYwMzY1"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_616642308386923/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dMTAyMzgxNTMxMA%3D%3D"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"616654391719048","from":{"name":"Ufaq Ashfaque","id":"594796590"},"message":"if I get my salary today, I am so going here :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-10T04:25:41+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"616659631718524","from":{"name":"Sheikh Salman","id":"100006034480285"},"message":"dil bagh bagh kr dya salary ki yad dla kr :) Ufaq Ashfaque","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-10T04:46:45+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"594796590","name":"Ufaq Ashfaque","type":"user","offset":45,"length":13}]},{"id":"616660215051799","from":{"name":"Ufaq Ashfaque","id":"594796590"},"message":"hheheh boy karna parhta hai :) I just hope k ajaey :D (Y) *happiness is Sattar Buksh* :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-10T04:48:16+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"616660245051796","from":{"name":"Umair Mahmood","id":"100000372540851"},"message":"Lol at moustache....","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-10T04:48:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"616660371718450","from":{"name":"Adnan Yasin","id":"723675110"},"message":"whats the name of the place?
