A place, possibly infested with roaches and rats, is treated as if it at the same caliber of say somewhere like Okra and Fujiyama. And then the alleged patrons of Damascus were suggesting that I should not have made my bad experience public on forums like SWOT and KFD as it shows that I have some of a personal vendetta against Damascus. One even suggested that I am perhaps getting paid by someone to bad mouth Damascus. Damascus\u0027 establishment merely suggested that I may be suffering from some sort of a allergy and they could not find anything in their records regarding my order and that they will get back to me. They merely let loose their hounds on me and never actually got back to me and did not offer an apology for my horrifying experience and the illness I have been suffering due to their food. I finally ended up going to the doctor today and he informed me that I am suffering from a throat infection. I specifically asked him if is possible that I may have contracted it from bad and/or rotten chicken. He said yes, it is very much possible. I am hereby completely writing off Damascus and will be never visiting it again. I would also suggest that one should stay clear of their shawarmas.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-25T05:35:04+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-25T11:17:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"680185313","name":"Khalid Ishaq"},{"id":"695260426","name":"Razia Shoaib"},{"id":"524990051","name":"Ovais Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI0OTkwMDUx","before":"Nzc3NjQ3ODAy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"416678875049935","from":{"name":"Ghausia Rashid Salam","id":"716901426"},"message":"Oh Faisal, how do you wind up in these situations?
