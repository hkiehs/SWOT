Was craving like anything for Red Velvets, after some pretty good reccomendations went to Pane \u0026 Amore. I must say I\u0027m swiped off my feet. \nThe cupcakes taste so fresh,light and the creme cheese is soo fluffy and unreal a clean and spotless cafe with an amazing staff. I think I\u0027m in cupcake heaven.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-08-16T16:17:06+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-18T12:36:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003660266586","name":"Mariyam Shahjahan"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"100003640081725","name":"Aiman Khalid"},{"id":"594796590","name":"Ufaq Ashfaque"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"566005153","name":"Mansab Uzair"},{"id":"100001882596023","name":"Mansoor Zaheer"},{"id":"599645349","name":"Hamna Haqqi"},{"id":"1058171190","name":"Fahad-Pakistani Zaidi"},{"id":"100000087775469","name":"Arshad Shamsi"},{"id":"100000234977922","name":"Zain Hasan"},{"id":"512000130","name":"Mustafa Masood"},{"id":"100001432075867","name":"Suhaila Tobeh"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"100000299126508","name":"Ahsan Javed"},{"id":"189100160","name":"Ehtesham Maqbool"},{"id":"100005558611444","name":"Rana Arslan"},{"id":"670615540","name":"Khurram Wahab"},{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan"},{"id":"505484337","name":"Mian Saad"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"518470140","name":"Mustafa Chhotani"},{"id":"669320704","name":"Fahad Azad"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"688651656","name":"Amin Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg4NjUxNjU2","before":"MTAwMDAzNjYwMjY2NTg2"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_604088056309015/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNjg4NjUxNjU2"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"604090789642075","from":{"name":"DrSyed Farrukh Jamal","id":"749655321"},"message":"Whers this Pane \u0026 Amore ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:26:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"604091912975296","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Ure lucky u got them....they usually run out of em...but werent they divine??","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:30:09+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"604093022975185","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Behind pink Cadillac.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:34:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"604093089641845","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"And omg Soha they were out of the world","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:34:46+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"604094196308401","from":{"name":"Shakeeb Ahmed","id":"516818488"},"message":"Suhaila Tobeh Fahad Hussain","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:38:28+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100001432075867","name":"Suhaila Tobeh","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13},{"id":"501632029","name":"Fahad Hussain","type":"user","offset":14,"length":13}]},{"id":"604094876308333","from":{"name":"Adnan Afzal","id":"100002014163412"},"message":"How much do they cost Ayesha?
