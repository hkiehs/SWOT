We had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. But that\u0027s not what I wanted to talk about here. We were seated next to two gentlemen who didnt seem to like the food/ ambience and the way they were behaving really bothered me. They were being rude  to the perfectly polite waiters who were bending over backwards to  please them, arrogant and completely obnoxious. Ranting and raving about the music which they didn\u0027t seem to like, complaining incessantly about the food, (by the way, I was eating the very same burger he was complaining about and it was actually very good). My daughters were shocked that people could behave in such a manner. Why is it that only in Karachi we find seemingly educated people behaving in a completely uncivilised way? Sure, everyone is entitled to  an opinion, but ranting and raving loudly in a cafe in the presence of other customers who are trying to enjoy their meal is completely unacceptable. Come on Karachi, when can we start behaving in a more civilised manner?","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-30T16:05:35+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-30T18:41:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"},{"id":"731410527","name":"Aziz Noorani"},{"id":"741222111","name":"Marvi Sarfraz"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"714178973","name":"Fatimah Jameel"},{"id":"100000578236531","name":"Naheed Asim"},{"id":"543131941","name":"Morag Khan"},{"id":"100002928478909","name":"Rabia Ahmed"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ2NjY0NTM4","before":"NjAyODQxNzU4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"287051228012701","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Because they felt better about their own insignificant lives......by thinking they can belittle a poor boy who was serving them.\n\nProbably God has not endowed them with much.
