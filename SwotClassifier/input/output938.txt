To start of with its more in line with desi chinese kind of like some of the better chinese eateries off Tariq Road.  We started with the white hot \u0026 sour which was surprisingly good.  Then for the starters we had a couple of ducks and some fried prawn starters.  Both need to be really improvedthe duck came with some variation of chapati rather than the chinese pancakes :-( The spring onions, cucumbers, and carrots(don\u0027t ask why), tasted pretty stale.  The prawn were really bad toocompletely dry and tasteless and chewy.  Then came the main courses.  The fish am not sure of the name was pretty bad as well but the dry beef chill and orange chicken were really good.  The chow main was also really good but desi style.  I also liked the toffee banana with vanilla ice cream.  What I would like to give a special mention to was the young kid who is the proprietor of the place.  He came and asked about the food was extremely polite and took the feedback extremely well.  We need more people like him who don\u0027t get defensive and smile back and say next time they will strive to do better.  Two thumbs up to him.  But that said they need to completely redo the duck, the prawns, and the fish.  The comment I would like to end with is on the prices.the prices were extremely good value for money and came to something around Rs.800 per head minus the duck and we really ordered a lot of food!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-02-04T14:14:26+0000","updated_time":"2012-02-05T13:48:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"100000374500079","name":"Misbah Nizami"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"516846714","name":"Haris Rahman Dittu"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NTg0NjgyMjQz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"310521872332303","from":{"name":"Farah Mirza Afridi","id":"620677462"},"message":"I\u0027d like to add to that Ziad...

When asked where the Hoisin sauce was, the waiter said \" u want the original?\u0027 And retured with 2 doll size bowls with Hoisin sauce in them!! I don\u0027t know if this was some new Fusion Peking Duck?? The fried bananas (which are my favorite abroad) were also bland and honestly I\u0027ve never seen a full banana fried and served before! Smaller pieces should be prepared and then served. Also we thought the prawns were actualy chicken cutlets with a prawn tail stuck to them. Lastly the music. Very few restaurants seem to get this right and play what the owner/employees like to listen to. I realy don\u0027t want to hear \u0027Dynamite\u0027 in a chinese restaurant. Pls put some instrumental music on. Not necesarily shrill chinese opera but I\u0027m sure there are great oriental fusion melodies available.But the decor was nice and cheerful. Staff was very polite and accomadating. The red fish and noddles were yummy. And the owner was a very sweet, eager young guy who I hope will take this feedback as positive coz I would like to return for another meal :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-04T14:44:25+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"310541845663639","from":{"name":"Misbah Nizami","id":"100000374500079"},"message":"Ziad thxs for the detailed feedback was thinking of eating there!
