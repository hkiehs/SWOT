Loved the new Kung Pao beef, and the Thai green curry in chicken. The chopsuey how ever was a little bland but dash of the hot sauce fixed that. Te steamed and fried wontons were a hit from the 2 year old to the 92 year old. \n\nAs usual piping hot hot fresh food. And HUGE quantities the entire family was stuffed and still plenty left over\n\nOne complaint that I texted and informed Asim was the use of corn starch in the Chinese curries - the sweet and sour prawns, both the soups and the chop seuy curry. It took away from the taste. I order GS regularly but rarely on a weekend so I am hoping it was due to that rush. But even thu it\u0027s something we ended up discussing at the amazing fabulous DESI brunch today and everyone had that complaint - so team Golden Dragon please limit that. \n\nThank you for other than that a great meal.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-09T16:03:36+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-11T07:50:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzgwOTAyNzg0","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"470405036343985","from":{"name":"Ovais Riaz","id":"643743707"},"message":"Type O\u0027s....

Ended up extremely satisfied with it !\n\nWe then were treated to the delicious Chewy Chocolate Brownie, thanks to Afroza aunty which was the perfect dessert to end our dinner for the day !\n\nA special mention to the waiter we were served by yesterday. Was very accommodating and understanding with the issues we were having with one of our tables which he got replaced, twice.\n\nAll in all, one of the best dining out experiences the three of us have had in a very long time !
