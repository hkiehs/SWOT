A lot has already been written about Pizzo, and the praise is well-deserved.\n\nOrdered the 12\" Deep Pan Pepperoni Pizza, and it was a treat for our taste buds. A standard-issue classic Pepperoni Pizza without any useless assortments, with just the right quantity of Mozarella, and a crunchy crust. The crust is perhaps the best I\u0027ve had in the city.\n\nPizzo just raises the bar high for Pizzas in the city, with competition mostly loading up Pizzas with irrelevant assortments, tomato sauce (instead of marinara), and cheap Mozarella. Pizzo is now my go-to delivery service.\n\nThe Spaghetti Bolognese was as feared, a disappointment. The spaghetti could have been just a tad-bit thicker, and the sauce lacked that kick, which makes the dish a classic.\n\nCustomer service is pretty decent, with the operator providing valuable suggestions -- while delivery took only 30min. With a per head cost of PKR500 (for 3 people, incl. tip), Pizzo served a flavorful meal without any random excuses or delays.\n\nRecommended for those who have a knack for Deep Pan Pizzas, and are tired of the ridiculously greasy NY Style Pizzas.\n\nOverall Rating -- 8.5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-27T00:07:20+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-29T20:35:13+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"522570731","name":"Hammad Ahmed Virk"},{"id":"1658686925","name":"Ali Charania"},{"id":"750380542","name":"Hina Shah"},{"id":"500778016","name":"Hammad Munir"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"609791225","name":"Afrah Jamal"},{"id":"505446215","name":"Junaid Siddiqui"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"860510556","name":"Sabeen Qamar"},{"id":"785615314","name":"Maleeha Jawaid"},{"id":"1346742308","name":"Ijlal Malik"},{"id":"803994779","name":"Shehryar Sheikh"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

THAT teriyaki was what i returned for to The Noodle House Pakistan but by that time, we were all done with the food, and once the rhythm breaks, its just not fun anymore. so we just had one piece and were done. i was so sad. because the second teriyaki he cooked for us was just amazing, there was just no space for us to eat more. i asked him, what went wrong with the first one, said the new one had some tenderiser in it. well, thats a go chef. Please always use tenderiser. it works well. \n\ncomplimentary mango pudding was served in order to make up the teriyaki. i would rate it a (7/10) and a 10/10 for being considerate. \n\nfor all the good things, i still dont like being charged for whats not edible for me. and i did not enjoying paying for that teriyaki. \n\nan over all 6/10 for me on the second visit. i think the 3rd visit will take a while, and cant risk it with anyone else. will have to go alone.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-08-29T18:52:34+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-29T18:52:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1257283317","name":"Aymun Zafar"},{"id":"100001089240373","name":"Abdul Basit Sivany"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTc1Mjc2NzUy","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"picture":"http://photos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/t1/1185297_10151972482393125_1418762510_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10151972482393125\u0026set\u003dpcb.611417202242767\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d9","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_611414025576418","from":{"name":"Omair Ahmed","id":"509507958"},"message":"Now that\u0027s what I call food art.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-29T18:40:55+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-29T18:40:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003756103781","name":"Asif Jamil Ansari"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcwMTAwMTk4","before":"MTAwMDAzNzU2MTAzNzgx"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_610749208976233","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"A Major policy shift\nWe at Log inn Lounge\nplan adding Coke/ Sprite/ Fanta line\nto the existing Pepsi/ 7up/ Marinda/ Dew line \nShould we or shouldn\u0027t we","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-28T09:45:12+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-29T18:38:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"522570731","name":"Hammad Ahmed Virk"},{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"},{"id":"100003756103781","name":"Asif Jamil Ansari"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"504239316","name":"Hala Qureshi"},{"id":"516588335","name":"Muhammad Mujeeb"},{"id":"630206256","name":"Latif Bawany"},{"id":"627250136","name":"Tauqir Abdulla"},{"id":"603100292","name":"Abbas Bootwala"},{"id":"792915494","name":"Ahmad Fayyaz Ali"},{"id":"1799716009","name":"Sameer Anwer"},{"id":"867800502","name":"Hira Saiyed"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"613037941","name":"Faiza Afzal"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"1346742308","name":"Ijlal Malik"},{"id":"652512048","name":"Haris Ahmed Mojib"},{"id":"100002182992564","name":"Sam S Ali"},{"id":"1367979764","name":"Shamsi Zia"},{"id":"592450109","name":"Farhan Qasim"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"1188460281","name":"Hira Mohammad"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"618475615","name":"Khushbakth Rizvi"},{"id":"850315404","name":"Faiza Nathani Sagheer"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODUwMzE1NDA0","before":"NTIyNTcwNzMx"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_610749208976233/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dODUwMzE1NDA0"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"610749515642869","from":{"name":"Syed Ahmer Ali","id":"542490655"},"message":"go for it !! ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-28T09:47:12+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"610749778976176","from":{"name":"Aamir Basrai","id":"500293260"},"message":"100% .......
