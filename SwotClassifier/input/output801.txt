The best part about Cbg has always been its serene and comfy environment and today also we just sat there ,talked and enjoyed our time stuffed with good food but as iftaar is incomplete without tea so we had tea afterwards and no one rushed us .Although I missed Hussain Tariq today but his team was as courteous and efficient as always and that\u0027s always a cherry on the top if the service is as good as the food!
