It was empty but we were refused a place for two as all the seats were reserved, around 3 more couples came in front of us and all were turned down. The people who booked their table for 7:30 arrived at 7:48 or 7:50. Now I know, I have no right to talk about the rule of a restaurant, but as a customer, I am a bit disappointed with the rule. Ginsoy is a small place with around 6 tables on the ground floor and 9 tables on the 1st floor, the rule should be first come first served basis. I was really upset, I mean you go all the way from North Nazimabad, just to get this, and this is not the first time, it happened before too with and with my parents, with me n my friends. We had to order take away, as we came from as they say the other side of bridge!! We placed are order at 7:45 and it came at around 8:15, so yeah we had to wait. All the things we ordered were good, except the rice as they were bland, no salt, no soya, just veggies and plain boiled rice. One more thing you guys turned almost 8 people down and I am sure there will be a lot more who would come and you will turn them down simply because they did not make a reservation. I like the food, but I have my reservations against such a rule.

But this ruined our weekend, because we did not have reservations anywhere else, and knocked at three more restaurants\u0027 doors before finally finding a table at Deli. Had we known at 6:00 pm that Ginsoy would not accommodate us, we would\u0027ve made reservations elsewhere. Anyways, I have a suggestion for Ginsoy.. Of the 15 or 16 tables that they have, they should reserve 10 at any time and let the rest be filled by walk-ins.

The place is quite cozy but the food is excellent. I ordered Tacos, which had an amazing savor served with tarter sauce. Chicken tarragon was mouth-watering and succulent. Chicken Alfredo was huge in quantity, satisfactory in taste. Amongst the drinks, Their Mint Lemonade was very refreshing. The staff there was sweet enough to get us a nice brownie with ice cream (in house) when they discovered that it was my birthday!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-26T14:04:12+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-26T15:36:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"783794861","name":"Ayesha Oosman"},{"id":"100001531348244","name":"Mahwish Hussain"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcwMTAwMTk4","before":"MTIxOTgwMDIyOA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"386598914724598","from":{"name":"Hifza Shah","id":"512091261"},"message":"Thank you Natasha Khalid.\u003d)) Hope to see to again soon! \u0026 many happy returns!! \u003d)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-26T15:36:05+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid","type":"user","offset":10,"length":14}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzg2NTk4OTE0NzI0NTk4","before":"Mzg2NTk4OTE0NzI0NTk4"}}}}]}
