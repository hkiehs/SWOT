The service was quick and whatever time taken was conveniently spent analyzing the cook\u0027s skill, who was making 10 bun kababs at the same time, putting bruce lee or a samurai or whoever has fast hands to shame. However, the wait was fortunately and unfortunately over soon. Fortunately because the food was here and unfortunately because the entertainment was over, unfortunately.\n\nThe burger arrived hot and warm at the same time. Anyways whatever it was was was resolved by opening the burger for 5 minutes and letting the outside wind do the talking. Not really outside though, since I was already outside and there cannot be an outside when you are already on the outside. The bun was roasted just the right amount which is probably the only sane comment you will read in this post. The patti was soft and lacked any meat because it is too expensive and the people too poor. \n\nWont talk about the economics of the game since we all know how cheap the burger is and I ABSOLUTELY HATE stating the obvious. \n\nAnd yes I forgot to mention - the place was good!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-06T05:30:11+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-08T08:49:22+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002971695699","name":"Syeda Tehseen Zehra Naqvi"},{"id":"511617534","name":"Abbas Zulfiqar Ali"},{"id":"100004366567543","name":"Asim Ibrahim"},{"id":"616725751","name":"Mona Liza"},{"id":"100003873535791","name":"Aimen Farooqui"},{"id":"619032343","name":"Anica Moiz"},{"id":"100000956691585","name":"Sauliha Qureshi"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"100000213569402","name":"Nouman Ahmed"},{"id":"1035116617","name":"Saad Vohra"},{"id":"704325486","name":"Faiza Bhati"},{"id":"629848557","name":"Farisa Afzal"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"515167270","name":"Noor Fatima"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"653425056","name":"Zainab Ali"},{"id":"736425186","name":"Maryam Zahoor Ansari"},{"id":"653483244","name":"Hafsa Liaqat"},{"id":"585612434","name":"Chaudhry Abbas"},{"id":"100002574825488","name":"Zainab Fus"},{"id":"759025230","name":"Hassan Jan"},{"id":"685940552","name":"Alizeh Tariq Saigal"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"100002505633547","name":"Umme Kulsoom Khalid Ahmed"},{"id":"531870819","name":"Bushra Samad Abdullah"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTMxODcwODE5","before":"MTAwMDAyOTcxNjk1Njk5"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_645756942142126/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNTMxODcwODE5"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"645761382141682","from":{"name":"Syed Bilal Azhar","id":"519515584"},"message":"how cheap the bunkabab* is","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-06T05:40:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645761508808336","from":{"name":"\u0027Eihab Khan","id":"869165645"},"message":"Simple and yet so profound, loved it :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-06T05:41:09+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645773195473834","from":{"name":"Sameen Shahid","id":"746376004"},"message":"i miss aloo bun kabab with green chutney :( .. craving for it now :(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-06T06:24:03+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645773588807128","from":{"name":"Sahar Fatima Ali","id":"100004422695930"},"message":"Haha, True story","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-06T06:25:44+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645777105473443","from":{"name":"Ahsan Ahmed","id":"651969947"},"message":"Bunkabab Badshah?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-06T06:42:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645782858806201","from":{"name":"Ahmed Zawar","id":"504626258"},"message":"best.food review.ever","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-06T07:13:24+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645811275470026","from":{"name":"Mahnaz Fahad","id":"514392526"},"message":"Cheeky review!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-06T09:14:59+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645814592136361","from":{"name":"Nisa Ali","id":"564985482"},"message":"lol This one  should get selected for the most epic review of year 2013","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-06T09:24:28+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645817348802752","from":{"name":"Osama Siddiqui","id":"589730762"},"message":"And unfortunately u forgot to mention the fortunate time when unfortunate burger arrived :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-06T09:39:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645827235468430","from":{"name":"Hasnain Abbas","id":"510921988"},"message":"I see what you did there :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-06T10:24:59+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645875665463587","from":{"name":"Abdul Hafeez","id":"773317577"},"message":"Still a better story than BK!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-06T13:14:30+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645942445456909","from":{"name":"Xobi Shah","id":"100000579313166"},"message":"lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-06T16:20:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"646048598779627","from":{"name":"Talib Amin","id":"785200197"},"message":"ok for people who seem to have missed the point... what is this post all about ?
