And I have in my previous reviews on GD, made special mention of the patience the call takers at GD are loaded with. But last night, I as usual started craving their signature dishes. Ordered 3 items from main course. Prior to placing my order on call, I was informed that my order which previously takes max 45 minutes, will take an hour n 15 minutes, bcoz of overload of delivery orders since it was Eid day 2. The way I was communicated this message was soo sweetly phrased \u0026 toned that it felt that it was not a matter I should worry about. The order taker was soo calm, patient, helpful \u0026 cooperative that I regret not asking his name! Will do that next time for sure. Anyways, my order arrived in exactly 1 hour. When I tore open the bag, it had 4 boxes where as it should have had 3 only. The first thing that popped up in my mind was that the extra box might have been put in there by mistake so after checking for my 3 items, my eyes fell upon the 4th box that had a small cute paper chit slid between the lid and a sheet (of some sort of paper to lock the steam and freshness in). The note read: \u0027COMPLEMENTARY\u0027 and the box contained Thai chicken noodles.\nYes free food does take ur breath away at times but in this case I wasn\u0027t jumping in joy bcoz I received 4 items for the charge of 3....but I was just soooo impressed by the priority treatment \u0026 its presentation. Its surprises like these that coupled with quality food \u0026 other factors makes one speak high of a restaurant. It may have been something that GD had planned to do on eid but it just made my day! Its gestures like these that leaves a lasting impression! Absolute Happiness I call it!\nGolden Dragon, uv again exceeded my expectations,only that this time its with a memorable incident!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-22T18:40:55+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-22T21:00:29+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"545337083","name":"Sabeen Waqar"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"748420149","name":"Sarosh Muzammil"},{"id":"751030900","name":"Zoha Manzar"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"741265709","name":"Sarah Hasnat"},{"id":"631611761","name":"Adnan Zafar"},{"id":"1454993708","name":"Tehniyat K.
