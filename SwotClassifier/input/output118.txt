I try it almost every weekend and the desserts are out class! My personal favorite is the Rs.170 Brownie with icecream. The hot crispy brownie is just the right amount of sweet and delfrio has such amazing icecream . . the texture and the taste is so beautiful. Therefore both combined makes your mouth experience a divineee sweetblast .. you just can\u0027t stop after your first bite! I\u0027ve almost tried all sorts of icecream combinations but the best with the brownie is french vanilla or crunchy caramel! Heaven!\n\nHeaven se yaad aya. Their cake chocolate heaven (i think thats the name) is exactly like nandos chocolate cake and if i remember correct I was told by someone that they supply to nandos. \n\nSo for dessert. . it\u0027s a big yesss!\n\nNow for food: There are better places ofcourse. But they don\u0027t do that bad food. So i wouldn\u0027t say flop. Their burgers have dry buns but juicy patties, the alfredo pasta has less salt, and garlic bread is a little too toasted. Peri bites are wonderful. . sandwiches are tasty. . Pizza however isn\u0027t a great item!\n\nNO i don\u0027t eat alot. I\u0027ve just been to it alot of times since it opened and have had the chance to try alot of things.. My suggestion: Definitely for dessert.

Was slightly disappointed. Tried the chicken with original sauce n other with mexican one. Nothing much to write home about. The bread may be authentic but wasnt so fresh n fillings were ok too. Chicken was juicy but the shawarma lacked any real punch. The original sauce was like a runny hummus but pretty bitter. Lamb meat was bit smelly but thats how lamb meat is. Masala fries were ok. My hubby didn\u0027t want to finish them and he\u0027s a fries freak. Rating 5/10. Prefer the shawarmas at arabian nights, damascus n in front of mottas store. \nTo make up for the food, we had some boba bubble tea selling right in front. Apple/peach with lychee poppers was amazing. Apple/pomegranate with orange wasn\u0027t bad either. Wish the drinks had been more chilled though.
