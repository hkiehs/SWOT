Ordered prawn makhni handi which was yumm. Grilled prawns were spicy and succulent. Prawn biryani was tasty as well. We wanted to try the leather jacket fillet which so many swotties have recommended but it wasn\u0027t available. Instead, tried the grouper fillet on waiter\u0027s (Shabbir) recommendation, and it turned out to be pretty ordinary to say the least.\nAll in all, I\u0027ll give the food an 8/10.

Jus\u0027 sayin\u0027\n\nI\u0027ve always loved desi Chinese food. I\u0027ve been raised on desi Chinese food. The more sweetish side of things, with so many spices that one\u0027s left wondering whether to eat or wipe one\u0027s nose or eat one\u0027s food. But oh, so good. \n\nThus, I convinced the family to order Golden Dragon tonight, even though they were most reluctant to order from a new place. Since my father and I are both allergic to ajino moto, we requested that no ajino moto be added in our food. Stuck to the basics, since it was my first time ordering. We ordered the hot and sour soup, hot and spicy wontons, crispy beef, hot and spicy chicken, chicken in oyster sauce, and vegetable fried rice. The first thing we got to open was the wontons. All the food was steaming, amazingly hot. Since Abu was in the kitchen with me, the first thing he did was make a face and say, \u0027Aye hai! Steamed wontons hamaray matlab k thori hain.\u0027 I took a bite, then forced him to take a bite. When I raised my eyebrows at him in question, all he said was, \u0027Han, acha hai.\u0027 That\u0027s huge coming from a man who can\u0027t stand steamed wontons! The soup was a bit on the sweeter side,and had a kick to it, which wasn\u0027t quite enough to overcome the sweetness. On to the crispy beef, which wasn\u0027t very crispy, since it was delivery, of course, and a tad bit extra salty, but not bad overall. The rice wasn\u0027t under seasoned, which was good to taste, and the hot and spicy chicken was quite delicious, Again, a bit sweet since it was a red sauce, but the spice kick was enough to make up for it. The chicken in oyster sauce however, tasted suspiciously like garlic sauce, and also had the light brown color of garlic sauce. However, since it was relatively milder, my mother quite enjoyed it, since she\u0027s not a spice fan. \n\nOverall, the helpings were most generous, the food most enjoyable overall, and had the perfect desiness that makes one reminisce of the good old days. It was so good for my dad, he decided that if we ever throw a party where we want Chinese food, we\u0027ll order from GD. \n\nBy the way, this also validated to my father that my analysis of food CAN be trusted. Thank you GD, for a wonderful dine-in experience in this wonderful weather.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-04T17:56:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-05T20:31:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

I cant write each n everything here but if sumone like me who has love for interior n have an eye to notice small lil things in his café might ask a few questions as to how u manage to mke the place so interesting… I like the interior of café zouk n then it has to b log in .. \n\nFirst and foremost, the service was good - the staff was polite .. \n\nOur meal started with complimentary drink … ordered Fettuccine Pasta and my friend ordered Burger from Hell (which was way too spicy bcoz we asked for extra spice otherwise najmi bhai suggested the same spice level they use to marinate n prepare the burger ;) ………. Words fail me in describing how delicious each and every element of the meal served to us was. I still have a taste in my mouth that I would like to give a go again for sure.\n\nIn short I will say, this is a place for foodies and people who simply enjoy a great meal in casual café wth warm ambiance n an amazing company thts najmi bhai .
