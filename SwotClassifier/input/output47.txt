It was just me , my husband and our 1 year old. We opted for their Chinese buffet which was quite reasonable for Rs.790 per head. The 2 soups that were served were chicken corn and thai. But of them had the same traditional taste, nothing different. One thing which i didn\u0027t like was that, they have limited dishes in their buffet. They must add more dishes to it. (We mentioned this on their feedback too). Also a proper, good conditioned baby seat wasn\u0027t available. The one provided had a broken barrier and fixed by a cardboard.. Coming to the taste, everything except cherry chicken and mushroom salad was good. I especially liked their beef pepper , and fried chicken. Although fried prawns had bland coating but they were good nonetheless.
