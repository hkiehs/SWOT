We had to return two of the items because they could not even get the grilled chicken right. And to consider that we pay nearly double the amount for an ordinary quality of the same steaks we get at any other steak house in town. The peri peri sandwich was good. The shroom burger has literally a thin slice of bland chicken in it. The buns were crumbling too. And the icing on the cake was the 10% service tax amounting to a Rs. 900 that was included when we only ordered for a party of eight. It was courteous of them to not let us pay that IF WE ARE OUT OF CASH. All in all. Excellent service. Quite average food. Ambience was okay.
