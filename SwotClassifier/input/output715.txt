Because all the reviews unanimously suggested that the portions are very generous we opted to order a single person lunch deal with an appetizer. Hence, the order comprised of Steamed Spicy Wontons and Beef in Garlic Sauce with the Egg Fried Rice.\n\nThe wontons were true to their name, steamed well but kept their shape and texture intact. The flavor notes were also spot on with the red chili flakes adding a good kick to the dish. The gravy was average at best probably because it was too desi-fied for my liking. I could hardly taste the flavor of garlic in the sauce and the most prominent flavor in the dish was that of corn flour as not only the beef was coated in it, but the gravy was also thickened using it. The rice was again adapted to cater to the majority and if I asses it keeping that in mind, it was a nice and typical Pakistani long grain version of fried rice.\n\nConsistent with the earlier reviews, we found the portions to be large and filling. The person who took the order was courteous and polite and delivery was made well within the committed duration of 45 minutes. The next time that I give this place a shot I will refrain from ordering anything with gravy and choose dry dishes for main and perhaps try a different starter.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-20T05:52:45+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-20T05:52:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"639117805","name":"Aamir Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjM5MTE3ODA1","before":"NjM5MTE3ODA1"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_461265930591229","from":{"name":"Shamail Wasi","id":"513506728"},"message":"Sitting at the Upper Crust (Zamzama) right now, first trip and miserably disappointed to the lowest cadres of depression.
