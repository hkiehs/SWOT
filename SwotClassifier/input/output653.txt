First place where I\u0027ve actually had a salad that has rocket in it and the good parmesan in it. It was so peppery and fresh and crisp that I didn\u0027t need the dressing with it! Which was served in a separate container, and barely there dressing. I would suggest to at least half-fill the container with dressing, kanjooson! :p Unfortunately, I had the pizza cold, and since I was too tired to reheat it, I ate it cold, but even then, it was most satisfactory, simply because the crust was devoid of oil, as usual, and the beef and jalapeno combination with the diced tomatoes was bee-yoo-tee-full. The parents wanted Chinese, so Ginsoy was their pick of the day. Red hot and sour soup, kung pao chicken, chicken manchurian and egg fried rice, which they really enjoyed. But the winner of the day was definitely Pizzo for me!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-19T20:19:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-19T20:19:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"558530146","name":"Fariha Nadir"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQwNjE5NTEw","before":"NTU4NTMwMTQ2"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_489071454477343","from":{"name":"Aamina Jahangir","id":"501859943"},"type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-18T07:23:18+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-19T20:00:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"501891633","name":"Komal Tauqeer"},{"id":"504654956","name":"Hiba Ali Raza"},{"id":"505094421","name":"Nadia Niazy"},{"id":"1579977743","name":"Amena Zoeb"},{"id":"530485619","name":"Hana Faisal"},{"id":"201004010","name":"Saiem Nasir"},{"id":"571060327","name":"Fawad Irshad"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"522705412","name":"Marvi Shah"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTIyNzA1NDEy","before":"MTIxMzYzNzA4Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"489106857807136","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100003681493822"},"message":"Looks yummy","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-18T08:47:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"489133274471161","from":{"name":"Haroon Leghari","id":"100000059823691"},"message":"This is served at HLS","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-18T10:21:54+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"489140844470404","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100003681493822"},"message":"From cakery u mean haroon?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-18T10:47:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"489140984470390","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100003681493822"},"message":"Asked as most eateries don\u0027t mk desserts themselves","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-18T10:48:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"489682741082881","from":{"name":"Nadia Niazy","id":"505094421"},"message":"Just got this for my sisters birthday.
