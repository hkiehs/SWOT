If one phrase were to sum up our evening, it would be that the attentive and seamless service of the evening surpassed their great food. I have to say, the management of Aylanto deserve \u0027shaabaashi\u0027 for how they have come around in regards to their service, timing, attentiveness and in being accommodating. \n \nNow about the food- goats cheese and broccoli soup, chilli prawns, and crab gratin got the festivities underway. The soup and the gratin were great- love their fine-dining interpretation of two ultimate confort foods- potato gratin and broccoli cheddar soup. However, the chilli prawns were a little overpowerring- they were not just spicy, but seemed to have been treated with a sort of garlic \u0027tharka\u0027, making them a bit oily and taking away from the flavor of the red chillis.\n \nOur entrees were lobster ravioli, served with a nicely balanced white sauce and cherry tomatos, which made each bite fresh as well as bringing out the sweetness of the lobster. However, we wished that the ravioli were boiled in water that was perhaps more salty. The second entree was the favorite steak chanterelle- cooked and rested to our preferences, but again, a little low in the seasoning.  Seems like the salt-police has chefs and kitchen staff everywhere holding back lately!!\n \nDesserts were to be had, though were were stuffed! The white chocolate cheesecake with bramble/ blackberry compote and tiramasu were divinely light as they were both creamy, cheesy, and sweet! I just wish that they had put a candle on the cake, as I had asked at the time of making reservations, but I guess it was alright, considering the indoor section of the restaurant was a little warm... but overall, a good evening, perhaps a sign of the wonderful year that lies ahead for the both of us!

A group of friends along with me and my husband went to Gracias Cafe for dinner yesterday. When my husband told me the name my mouth started watering... I am a native Texan so I love Mexican food as the name implied. Unfortunately I\u0027m also a bit of a food snob so its hard to pull on over me if I know the cuisine ( if i don\u0027t I keep my mouth shut and eat). So when we reached Gracias we were the only 6 people there which is ok with me because when we friends get together we can be a loud bunch.The music selection was amazing good old songs. It took us 15 min to decide and order and we were set. Unfortunatly it took around 40 min before our starters appeared. When they did arrive the nachos were good but the Fried Basket was not up to our expectations the fries had a re-fried taste after a whopping one hour our food came and we all held our breaths hoping that the taste would make up for the wait. Yes yes yes.. the food was great, the burritos were filled well and the most important thing the sour cream was actually sour cream! I specifically asked our server if it was \"real\" sour cream and it was. A friend ordered the Alfredo and  the texture of the sauce was good but a tad under-seasoned ( no biggie). My husband ventured into the unknown and ordered Enchiladas at my insisting and they were made well with good, tender chicken. We also tried the Quesadillas and they were good too except that the accompanying salsa was a bit sweet .. maybe a little more lime? I must say the portions were more than adequate.. we had to pack a lot of the food. The main disappointment in terms of food was the fried ice cream.. no it was not fried .. it was rolled in corn flakes... ugh... and  the edible basket that it was in was stale.. when the server/ manager came to ask us if everything was good we told him about the one hour wait and he was sincerely apologetic and he told us that they had an on site catering event hence the slow service... that made us feel better.. the fact that he was nice and had a valid reason . he also gave us a complimentary drink so that we could try one of their specialities that we hadn\u0027t ordered ( The Red Lady) overall it was not a bad experience.. I\u0027m glad there\u0027s a restaurant that has real sour cream and good Mexican food","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-15T07:17:54+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-16T06:25:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"626316534","name":"Rabeeah Bawany"},{"id":"512185530","name":"Sidra Shah"},{"id":"680185313","name":"Khalid Ishaq"},{"id":"585622689","name":"Naveed Ismail"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"783794861","name":"Ayesha Oosman"},{"id":"674895636","name":"Hadi Vazir"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid"},{"id":"698885102","name":"Aamir Ghaffar"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"100001973577700","name":"Saad Asim"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA5ODQwOTE3MQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NjI2MzE2NTM0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"398241310227025","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Hifza Shah","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-15T09:11:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah","type":"user","offset":0,"length":10}]},{"id":"398242893560200","from":{"name":"Farah Faraz","id":"697141034"},"message":"Oh sounds good...where is it located exactly?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-15T09:18:35+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"398243760226780","from":{"name":"Aamir Ghaffar","id":"698885102"},"message":"Badar commercial...bundoo khan lane","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-15T09:22:13+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"398282846889538","from":{"name":"Hifza Shah","id":"512091261"},"message":"Sophia Ghaffar Your first swot, honored that it was about gracias \u003d), and one of the kindest review itself.. you don\u0027t need to say please be kind \u003dp Thank you so much for the great review and the patience.

The food at 44 was excellent - had the pan fried fish, and the molten lava cake.  The fish had the right flavour, and tenderness - while the sauce blended in with the flavour of the fish smoothly. The cake was truly \u0027molten\u0027 and was a delicious treat. \n\nMore importantly, the appetisers, main course, and dessert, all arrived in a timely manner, with lunch finishing in 45min.\n\nOverall, a pretty good experience and will definitely go again.
