{"datums":[{"id":"165861103465048_637129329671554","from":{"name":"Aqsa Shah","id":"1088748635"},"message":"So after so many good reviews about The Burger Shack, last night my craving for a good burger was too high and I gave it a try. We were six people and each of us ordered different flavors. Other than that we ordered onion rings, shack loaded fries, tangy loaded fries, peanut butter shake, lemon breezer and shack \u0027a’ bon from the dessert.  After a long wait of approx 30 mins we finally got the order.\n\nFull shack house from beef and honey mustard crunch from chicken are highly recommended. Smokey crunch was too simple and plain to be called smokey plus shack shroom from which I expected to have mushrooms hardly have any, though the burger was good.  Besides that all the flavors were worth trying. \n\nOnion rings were so good even the fries were. Tangy loaded fries were good in quantity and with the same expectation when I opened up the box of shack loaded fries, which costs the same; to my surprise more than half of it was empty. It hardly had number of fries. I felt sorry for my little brother!\n \nPeanut butter shake was so yummy that I was continuously asking for a sip from my sister. I found lemon breezer bitter in taste. And there I felt bad for not ordering shake for me.\n\nThe dessert I ordered was looking gorgeous and I was pretty excited to finish my burger and taste it, but to my big disappointment it tasted like a bakery wala bun that we dip in chai and eat so it do not dry our throats. It’s the picture of shack a’bon which was completely dry from inside. No one liked it and I’m still left with this! \n\nIf it’s only about burgers then I would give 8/10. But to the overall experience I would give 6.5/10.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-10-20T11:17:11+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-20T18:09:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501478359","name":"Mohammad Mikail Soomro"},{"id":"100000522564819","name":"Imran Bahadur"},{"id":"517920558","name":"Imran Khan"},{"id":"100004078952313","name":"Shazia Asghar"},{"id":"100003216046346","name":"Shezi Memon"},{"id":"574362941","name":"Murtaza Naqvi"},{"id":"100002971695699","name":"Syeda Tehseen Zehra Naqvi"},{"id":"1208451657","name":"Noman Babar"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"645099594","name":"Mujahid Iqbal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ1MDk5NTk0","before":"NTAxNDc4MzU5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"637157553002065","from":{"name":"Ovais Khan Yousufzai","id":"1492617104"},"message":"Ismai ek makhi daldayteen tow aur maza ajata 3:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T12:37:24+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637158923001928","from":{"name":"Zahra Sharif","id":"549360489"},"message":"Price bracket?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T12:43:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637159199668567","from":{"name":"Omer Ali Khan","id":"660370720"},"message":"Troll!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T12:44:17+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637161046335049","from":{"name":"Aqsa Shah","id":"1088748635"},"message":"Zahra Sharif The overall bill was rs.2580, which is quite reasonable.

Decided to order again after reading good reviews on food forums combined with prompting by the parents (who have always loved Dominos)and I am happy to say that the old Domino’s taste is back notable improvements. \nOrdered the Tandoori Feast (Chicken), Italiano Feast (Beef) \u0026 the Stuffed Tex-Mex Cheesy Bread  and the food came in 30 minutes on the dot. The best part about the Pizza – the beautiful crust, crisp yet soft \u0026 chewy, with a dusting of cornmeal at the edges! I became a fan of McD’s when they launched their cornmeal burger buns and exact same experience with Dominos! Toppings wise, there could have been more chicken and a little bit more consistency across slices might have prevented fights over the best pieces. However, both flavors were loved by the family. \nThen the Cheesy Bread – Domino’s is known for its Pizza, but the bread could easily have been the star of the evening! Breadsticks stuffed with cheese \u0026 tex-mex chicken topped with cheese made for 8 pieces of delicious cheesy indulgence!\nMy only complaints: the lack of condiments –there was no garlic \u0026 red chili flakes. Secondly, one small container of marinara sauce is not enough for the breadsticks, so more would be preferred. \nLastly, they need to update their menu on their website! The current deals link does not work, and they don’t have any delivery deals for ‘x’ number of people mentioned. Since the order taker told me about a deal for 4 people, I am sure there are some and updating them would save time in order placement. \nP.s. deleting \u0026 posting again because had mistakenly posted a really small picture earlier!","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-10-19T21:31:03+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-20T12:16:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"512777667","name":"AMmar Mursalin"},{"id":"100002971695699","name":"Syeda Tehseen Zehra Naqvi"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"579933313","name":"Ali Daudpota"},{"id":"675647072","name":"Ambreen Ashraf"},{"id":"1035196445","name":"Anusha Ahmed"},{"id":"521905536","name":"Umair Durrani"},{"id":"100003698171140","name":"Asra Mushtaq"},{"id":"500846017","name":"Sheharyar Mujahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAwODQ2MDE3","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc0MDgxMjMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"636902953027525","from":{"name":"Shahroz McRashid","id":"100003629416976"},"message":"where are the all the (Y) s?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-19T22:21:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"636945583023262","from":{"name":"Hasnain Hanif","id":"770944605"},"message":"this made me emotional :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T01:12:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637048449679642","from":{"name":"Khalid Saleem","id":"657031744"},"message":"your review is quite appealing and would definitely give it a try soon but i wonder why the pictures are so bland saying more of otherwise what you expressed","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T07:05:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637058733011947","from":{"name":"Kiran Afzal","id":"635810442"},"message":"Could be either of two issues: not great photography and pizza doesn\u0027t always photograph well, especially when its beef! ..better pictures next time, hopefully!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T07:40:10+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637089983008822","from":{"name":"Nasim Ahmad","id":"1343979604"},"message":"Very nice.
