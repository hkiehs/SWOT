Excellent food.  No complaints about the service except that the olive oil and balsamic vinegar was brought to the table a few minutes after the bread basket was served and by that time we had already attacked the bread basket and finshed all of it.  Another bread basket however followed.  Had a full red meat meal - Beef Carpaccio (i always thought that Flo made the best beef carpaccio but this one was as good as what\u0027s available at Flo) and Pepper Steak (asked for medium and got a medium) 300 gms excellent piece of cow meat which i really enjoyed - one of the finest steaks i\u0027ve had in the recent times.  All at our table went home very happy with the quality of food.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-14T19:34:19+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-14T20:01:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"734228975","name":"Rizwan Mustafa Yusuf"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4","before":"NzM0MjI4OTc1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"277909272260230","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"they have excellent salads and fish - you are going for a kebab and nihari dinner tomorrow\n\ni dont want to know whats your cholestrol level!!!!!!! yikes","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:37:06+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"277909442260213","from":{"name":"Najia Omer","id":"100001697733780"},"message":"we never got a bread basket!! i think the presentation of food is horrible at olivetto, taste was okay nothing amazing.. but seriously presentation was beyond horrible, i think it matters alot!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:37:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"277910698926754","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"cholestoral level is within the required normal range  Nezihe Hussain.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:39:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain","type":"user","offset":55,"length":14}]},{"id":"277910848926739","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"kitne ki bet lugi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:39:33+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"277910962260061","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Aalia Mahboob Elahi - care to answer that","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:39:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1048742368","name":"Aalia Mahboob Elahi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":19}]},{"id":"277911368926687","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"jitne ki bet lagani hai laga lo - its 157.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:40:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"277911782259979","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"i dont believe it - whose blood did you giv","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:41:18+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"277912302259927","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"my own, the docs also were surprised, asked to repeat and same result.  no one believes it Nezihe Hussain","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:42:01+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain","type":"user","offset":91,"length":14}]},{"id":"277914075593083","from":{"name":"Khalid Lakhani","id":"711077848"},"message":"Abid Aziz Merchant, didn\u0027t you announce you were on a fruit diet till tomorrow???","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:45:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"840619510","name":"Abid Aziz Merchant","type":"user","offset":0,"length":18}]},{"id":"277914175593073","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Najia Omer, that\u0027s very strange, i\u0027ve always got a bread basket at Olivetto and the presentation was perfect.
