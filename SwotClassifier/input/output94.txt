I ordered Thai curry (red) with egg fried rice which were accompanied by a relish. The curry had split in half green and red chillies, chicken, mushrooms and the sauce had a coconut-y flavor to it. The first bite was so tempting that I couldn\u0027t even wait to take a picture lol. As per my mom and sister it was on the spicier side due to the chillies but then I\u0027m very fond of chillies so I actually didn\u0027t feel it. The rice were done perfectly and the relish was the perfect sideline. The quantity was sufficient enough for someone with a normal appetite.\n\nMy sister order a yum crub salad (if I remember correctly) as her main (diet conscious :p). it had cashews, chicken, cucumbers, onions etc, the veggies were crisp and fresh and the salad had a tangy flavor to it. I personally don\u0027t prefer eating raw onions so I wouldn\u0027t opt for it but my sister loved it. \n\nMom ordered fettucine Alfredo since she had a sore throat and needed something soothing and mild to eat and the pasta was perfectly as needed. Very mild but delectable flavors with good amount of cheese and chicken. Dad ordered stuffed chicken, but didn\u0027t get to taste it,  was too busy eating mine :-D but it did look delicious although a little more mashed potatoes can be served.\nSince we all were either suffering/recovering from cold so we didn\u0027t order drinks. \n\nAll in all the ambiance was perfect, the service was a bit slow waited for atleast 30 mins or so for the food and similarly waited for the bill to arrive, the staff was very courteous and yes our bill was around 2800 something. Would definitely love to visit again","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-12T15:17:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-13T11:18:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"821845528","name":"Yesra Farid"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1223546771","name":"Anam Sohail"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"584486829","name":"Haris Hanif Loya"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"531176306","name":"Farah Khan"},{"id":"759025230","name":"Hassan Jan"},{"id":"617371190","name":"Samar Mughal"},{"id":"682502588","name":"Mahin Khalid Siddiqui"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjY4OTYxNDAz","before":"ODIxODQ1NTI4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"648933428491144","from":{"name":"Abdullah Ahmed Muhammad","id":"571594364"},"message":"where is it in smchs?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-12T17:55:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"648933628491124","from":{"name":"Bushra Waheed","id":"649980502"},"message":"Near Allah wali chowrangi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-12T17:55:48+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"649041395147014","from":{"name":"Rabeet Rao","id":"749204552"},"message":"Read this too:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/swotsrestguide/permalink/648611268523360/","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-12T21:45:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"649175251800295","from":{"name":"Bushra Waheed","id":"649980502"},"message":"Yes I did read that Rabeet Rao, it made my mouth water :-D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-13T04:01:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao","type":"user","offset":20,"length":10}]},{"id":"649291091788711","from":{"name":"Rabeet Rao","id":"749204552"},"message":":D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-13T11:18:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ5MjkxMDkxNzg4NzEx","before":"NjQ4OTMzNDI4NDkxMTQ0"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_648175595233594","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Do you think its time for another cooking competition?\n\nNot to bring out the mean competitiveness in anyone, SWOT-A-COOKOUT will encourage and bring forth hidden talents.\n\nWe are open to suggestions and ideas for this event.
