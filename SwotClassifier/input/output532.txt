Went to Ginsoy extension last Saturday with a friend around 2:30sh. Called in to reserve but the reservation wasnt made, but since it was just two of us so luckily didnt have to wait. Placed our order right away coz both of us were extremely hungry. Ordered Prawn Balls as appetizers, Large portion of Prawn chilli dry and a medium portion of Kung Pao Chicken. \n\nFirst the good....The quality of food was excellent and by the end of it we were stuffed and could not possibly have another bite.... Thats one reason I will go back...\n\nNow the bad....We got our appetizers in 25 minutes and on inquiring why it took so long they come up with the excuse that \"sir yeh tau sab fresh banta hai\", as if other restaurants serve re-heated food maybe? Instead of the prawn chilli dry they got chicken chilli dry and tried to convince me that it was fish...As soon as we dug in our main course the waiter comes up and hands us the bill... I was like \"What..!\" So then he got all uncomfortable and went back... While we were in the middle of lunch one of the \"managers\" comes up and says \"Sir aap ko yahan say hatna PARAY GA\"... My friend was like Excuse me... and then they tell us they have a reservation of twenty people.. My friend goes like well thats not really our problem especially considering you got our order wrong and made us wait another 15- 20 minutes... \nI actually started losing it and to add fuel to the fire they sent up the reservation of 20 upstairs so that we would make a move..So my friend got up and started asking the manager about what is going on to which he had the audacity to say \"Tau kya main iss reservation ko APNAY SAR pay bithaon ga\". I swear to God it was his lucky day that my friend was fairly cool minded and the so called manager didn\u0027t say that to me otherwise consequences would have been bad... Now unfortunately it was a huge group of ladies and we didn\u0027t feel right in making them wait furthermore, to which we found out that they got their reservation wrong as well coz apparently they had booked for Saturday and they noted it down for Sunday... So we asked the waiter to pack our food, but two of the ladies were nice enough to finish our meal and then leave, but ofcourse we couldn\u0027t do that.. \nWe paid our bill downstairs and the last nail in the coffin was that they didn\u0027t get all of the things we got packed and go like \"acha aap ko sab chahiye tha\"... \n\nOn our way out one of the managers downstairs apologised profusely but once u leave a bitter taste its hard to recover..\nWhen in the service industry one can\u0027t afford such goofups no matter how much pressure there is.. The food and service needs to be equally good.. Seems like the booming success of Ginsoy has gone to their heads and they need to come down a couple of notches before it gets too late.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-18T18:23:50+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T07:50:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"537640231","name":"Zara Gulabo Makhdoom"},{"id":"515251346","name":"Adnan Nazim"},{"id":"633231978","name":"Iqbal G Hussain"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"614385745","name":"Amber Haque"},{"id":"602590206","name":"Ariya Patel"},{"id":"219000363","name":"Deen Sheikh"},{"id":"600144971","name":"Khawaja Zee"},{"id":"649390400","name":"Amber Zulfiqar"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"286700230","name":"Umair Shafi Afzal"},{"id":"860945273","name":"Erum S Rahim"},{"id":"568861941","name":"Hassan Ahmed"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"},{"id":"553586655","name":"Ambreen Intizar"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"753811545","name":"Atiya Abbas"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzUzODExNTQ1","before":"NTM3NjQwMjMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"542850962432725","from":{"name":"Atiya Abbas","id":"753811545"},"message":"seems like nothing went right for them, terrible service","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-18T18:50:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"542851452432676","from":{"name":"Sharmeen Merchant","id":"765975396"},"message":"The service is pathetic.

Noodles were finished last eve and so were the accompanying raw veggies, paapri and the addictive laal chutney.  The curry was good enuff for 6-7 servings so this eve made my own version of SF\u0027s leftover Khowsuey.  Boiled a pack of noodles, poured the curry on top of it, added some freshly cut coriander and spring onions.  With no leftover paapri, added some Chill Flavored Kurkure, Tom Yum Kung Flavored Peanuts and Special Chaat Masala that I got from Silver Spoon on my last visit there (yes this is the masala that Silver Spoon sprinkles on their Meethi Puri).  So a whole new flavored Khowsuey this eve that didn\u0027t taste like the leftovers from yesterday.  SF you should either increase the quantity of noodles or reduce the quantity of curry by half.

Happy reading!\n\nI had a breakfast plan with a nayi naveli dulhan friend which didn\u0027t work out because she overslept this time, not me (Yaaayyyy!). So we ended up going for dinner instead. Met another Nazia (Friend of my dulhan friend), and obviously us Nazias are fun peoples, so it was really nice to meet another nice person. My dulhan friend is nice, anyway, one of the bestest peoples I know ? This time, I wanted to try something different, and my dulhan friend suggested the Mei Goreng, which she said reminded her of her favorite Singaporean food that she loved, which is a noodley-vegetabley-shrimpish dish, with just the right balance of spice and salt, with a hint of sour, and just absolutely a delight to eat. I also asked for the Kiwi Lime, which was a perfect drink for my dinner. I have never gulped down a drink as quickly as that one, except water. I like my water. Anyhoo, everyone already knows how I love Forty4\u0027s gambas and calamari, so I won\u0027t wax lyrical about those two again. Suffice it so say my appetizers were as fantastic as ever. It was only after the Mei Goreng came that I realized this was a complete seafood dinner for me. And of course, nobody makes churros like Forty4 does. The other Nazia didn\u0027t even want to try the dessert, and I insisted that she try at least one. Her expression when she took her first bite of churros was absolutely brilliant. That was the loudest I laughed the entire evening. And when she went in for the second churros, I was like, \u0027Achaaaaa? Aik aur? Heeeeeeeeeheheheheheheehe!\u0027 And of course, I got my leftover Mei Goreng home for my late night snacking. Yaaaayyy!
