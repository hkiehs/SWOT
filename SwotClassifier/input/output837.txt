Only because the deal looked very promising. No wonder it was. Started off with their in house served bread basket, this was fresh and filling. Amongst the soups ordered, hot and sour was good but chicken cream soup topped off all ,was delicious. thou the quantity could have been a little more. Then amongst the dished on the table I ordered grilled chicken with birds eye chili which was scrumptious, the other one I loved was the fried sea bass with lemon crème served with mash potatoes. I must say it was cooked to perfection with a mouth watering sauce to top it up. A recommendation for seafood lovers.. Wok fried beef with basil chili oyster sauce one was alright.\nIn desserts, their bread pudding is delectable thou chocolate molten lava cake was equally remarkable.\nOverall the experience was fun.

Perfect place to sit outside and have dinner. First rcvd the bread basked, the bread was okay but the chilli flvrd butter(or so i think it was, pretty good). Next came the mains for grilled jumbo prawns with risotto and pesto and shrimp pizza. Grilled prawns were great, pizza was good too(although i thought it would be some thing else), it was pesto instead of marinara sauce and shrimp, 2 kind of cheese with sun dried tomatoes and onion. I guess the experience was okay, not that good to get me through again.\nAfter that went to Berrylicious, had coconut and passion fruit with strawberry. Both were really great almost reminded me of Pinkberry in dxb. Both flavors were similiar to Pinkberry which made me think that is this the franchise of Pinkberry or did they make a really good copy of it?\n\nAlso went to friday to port grand and settled for charman mao, which was strictly average. Ordered bbq wings, manchurian chicken, dry beef with chilli and vegi rice. Everything was decent except beef, i couldnt taste the beef at all. Also went to dolmen city tariq road, went to chairman mao again with a friend as we had to go for dinner somewhere else, ordered crispy beef and prawn on toast. Crispy beef was bad, couldnt taste the beef at all + it was burnt. Prawns on toast were decent.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-24T17:02:58+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-24T17:02:58+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"667950490","name":"Usman Rauf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY3OTUwNDkw","before":"NjY3OTUwNDkw"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_402759023108587","from":{"name":"Hirah Sid","id":"514290400"},"message":"Has anyone tried Bellavita????","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-23T16:11:47+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-24T16:25:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"541276134","name":"Omer Jawed"},{"id":"200900469","name":"Hassan Ashfaq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjAwOTAwNDY5","before":"NTQxMjc2MTM0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"402927986425024","from":{"name":"Bisma Patel","id":"877870480"},"message":"I haven\u0027t been there but I have read about their chocolate lava cake on SWOT.

Ambiance was nice, a serene enviroment welcomes you on arrival. Unlike other places on that strip its not overcrowded despite having a crowded look on the outside. Seating arrangement is spacious and comfortable, with sofa\u0027s and chairs at three different levels. They have a upper deck, a middle level, a lower deck and a sheesha lounge, the middle two being right on the ocean and one can actually feel the tide come and hit the rocks below coupled will the flood lights on the sea which creates an enchanting effect.Coming to the service aspect both the staff and servers are more like programmed robots and need to be more vigilant to the diners needs, they keep sauntering around the place but to get hold of them is a tough task. A bottle of water took 15-20 minutes to arrive, its seemed like they were manufacturing it, drinks arrived ten minutes after dinner was served and I had to remind them, coordination is lacking and staff was not properly trained in this aspect. Ordered their Charcoal Combo platter, which was fresh and crisp comprising of batter fried mushrooms, chicken wings and fried chicken with mozzarella cheese accompanied with two yummy dips, also had the Beef Cheese Burger and Chicken Fajita Burger both well done, were well flavored, succulent pieces of grilled chicken breast and had a spicy tinge, but the bread was not as it should be, a bit soggy and quality of the bun could be improved, fries could be more crisp. For desert had Blueberry Cheese Cake was very good, light and fluffy with a biscuit crust, really melted in the mouth, a generous helping for two to three weight watchers. Overall experience was good, a place which stands out from the crowd and has an air of sophistication, recommended for foreign guests who may have the impression that Karachi is a city under siege or civil war, taking them to this places will showcase the soft face of Karachi and the beauty of the sea. They just need to work a tad bit more on their service.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-24T11:24:45+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-24T15:29:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"741265709","name":"Sarah Hasnat"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQxMjY1NzA5","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"403364046381418","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Try Kolachi next time.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T15:11:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403370973047392","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Kolachi is the next target...what do u recommend?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T15:27:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403372099713946","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Hunzai Handi.

I look after a chain of restaurants in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Have been following the eatery scene in karachi that has developed fast and furious but the biggest difference I see is the Management of a restaurant. I have witnessed Owners of establishments working full time, looking after all affairs. We on the other hand hire the professionals of the industry and the owners only have a say in upper level decisions (new menu, staffing, food sampling, vendor selections, etc.), Operations is manned by the personnel who have expertise in their respective fields. Food have been superb at many a new restaurants that I have tried but looking after costing, service, designing and other operational matters is better  left to the professionals to make it a successful venture. All said, I have been to a couple of outlets who have employed thorough industry people and reaping good results. On the other hand some owners who have knowledge of this industry are also doing very well but they have hired good helping hands.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-24T09:11:26+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-24T14:06:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003898006618","name":"Zarfras Siddiki"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"100000226398562","name":"Irum Ali"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzMzcxOTYzMA\u003d\u003d","before":"MTAwMDAzODk4MDA2NjE4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"403252559725900","from":{"name":"Shoaib Zaidi","id":"100002963111412"},"message":"The \"world is flat\" cliche may apply.
