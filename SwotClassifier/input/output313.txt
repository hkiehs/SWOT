The quarter chicken leg was quite small which was replaced. I do want to mention the energy and the exemplary service of the servers throughout iftar...I felt so bad calling my server again and again for refills and I apologized too but she just smiled and said no need to apologize.....they were short of garlic sauce but mild+wildherb has the same amazing effect....so all good. Came back home and spoke about my experience so much that my sister started craving for it like hell..she called up her friend and they went to the boat basin branch at 12am (tee hee). And she came back smiling from ear to ear and saying \u0027life is beautiful\u0027 hahaha.....Nandos does that to people I guess \u003c3 Her friend was also equally ecstatic about the food experience...so yeah Nandos made 4 people definitely happy today \u003c3 Yay!
