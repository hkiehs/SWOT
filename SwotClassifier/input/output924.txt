I have to say it was \u0027perfect\u0027. The level of sweetness was just right and the flavour felt extremely natural as per what their advertising campaign purports. The yogurt was also textured beautifully and felt soft and smooth with a just a negligible amount of coarseness. All in all a fantastic low fat dessert at a very reasonable price.

We ordered the mutton raan, mash ki daal, brain masala, seekh kebab, palak gosht, mutton handi green masala, and steam roast chicken….yes a bit over the top for five people but we hadn\u0027t been in ages.  This came with a variety of naans and parathas.  The mash ki deal was truly legendary (the best i have ever had) and I have not used that term to describe many things. The mutton raan as expected was also really good!!! The seekh kebabs were below average and in fact we didn\u0027t even finish them :-(  The brain masala again a super hit, we ordered a second round of this as the quantity was a bit stingy…..the palak gosht I thought was spectacular but others at the table felt it was good and not beyond.  Mutton handi green masala again very good with the mutton just melting in your mouth.  The surprise hit of the day was the steam roast chicken….I was expecting it to be very average but was completely blown away…it had some churan type masala on its coating which was quite addictive…the same type of addictive feeling you get when you start eating a pack of party slims chilli chips!!! All in all a great experience .. everyone must go and try all the dishes mentioned above minus the seekh kebab… and yes the place really needs to be done up again it is really lacking in the renovation department….but then again a true foodie will always over look that and concentrate on the food!!!  After this went to TUC\u0027s to wash down all the goodies with the best Froyo\u0027s in town…had the natural and the chocolate and both hit the spot!!!! What a night out!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-05T04:57:03+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-06T16:00:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000374500079","name":"Misbah Nizami"},{"id":"521690093","name":"Louie Sh"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"},{"id":"600021922","name":"Naveed Qazi"},{"id":"100003825603967","name":"Syed Ahmed"},{"id":"559881298","name":"Nadia Mahasin"},{"id":"672460650","name":"Yousuf Ali Sayeed"},{"id":"508588993","name":"Saroasha Eng"},{"id":"591335180","name":"Umair Aftab Mirza"},{"id":"656325157","name":"Adnan Amjad"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"524111275","name":"Zainab Dossa"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI0MTExMjc1","before":"MTAwMDAwMzc0NTAwMDc5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"373036079414215","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Was their air conditioning working Ziad?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-05T05:06:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"373037149414108","from":{"name":"Ayesha Mehmood","id":"648125726"},"message":"location?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-05T05:09:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"373039392747217","from":{"name":"Ziad Bashir","id":"791715789"},"message":"No air-conditioning just a TV with really bad reception showing the IPL matches……location is near lighthouse area…..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-05T05:15:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"373039736080516","from":{"name":"Ayesha Mehmood","id":"648125726"},"message":"ah okay, got it \u003d)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-05T05:16:16+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"373042179413605","from":{"name":"Adnan Amjad","id":"656325157"},"message":"Legendary!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-05T05:20:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"373044949413328","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Haven\u0027t been to kaiser in a few years now, good to hear it still serves great food.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-05T05:23:37+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"373045996079890","from":{"name":"Afroza Bhamani","id":"846664538"},"message":"Kausar has mastered the art of slow cooking and balancing the masala...

It was kind of houseful as a large group was present. It was very obvious from the service and staff\u0027s body language that they were not confident to serve the full house. First my daughter ordered Bruschetta for appetizer and the waiter brought something different. When the right order came obviously rest of us were finished with our appetizers. Our friend ordered a beaf steak and they came back to tell us that all the steaks were consumed by the other group so they were out of stock. Instead we ordered Grilled Snapper. When the main course came, the first bite from the fish tasted funny. I smelled it and Uuuughh it was stinking and very obvious that the meat had gone bad. We called the waiter and returned the dish, for 10 mins there was a corner conference near the kitchen, everyone smelling the dish and making faces. Finally they came and asked if they want us to order another fish? Hello....what about the one you served earlier? They said we have complained to the chef....bla bla bla......\nA restaurant experience is not just about the food although food is usually most important. But the experience starts from the moment you call them for a reservation or give your car to the valet till you leave satisfied and there is a smiling face at the door asking you to come again. Last night Blue Ginger failed miserably on all parameters, food, service, ambience (lamp shade on top of our table was also broken). I would certainly not recommend this place. Weather has changed and with so many power breakdowns food gets spoiled in the refrigerators. I am sure they at Cafe Blue Ginger do not take care of it. Probably meat is defrosted and frozen again....at least I won\u0027t go there again ever.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T05:22:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-06T12:52:46+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"373721009345722","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Fair balanced review.

I wrote a bad review once about their service, but boy was I wrong. I can\u0027t commend the service enough but let me try... First off, I love the positive vibes and smiles the servers carry with them at all times. My coffee had gotten cold while I was having breakfast, so I asked the server if he could heat it up. I was very pleasantly surprised to see him get my a freshly brewed cup of Americano instead. Second, I LOVEEEE how baby-friendly the place is. From the guard at the gate, to the waiters inside, everyone goes out of their way to accommodate me and my baby by helping me carry her bouncer/diaper bag etc. I was there for coffee yesterday and at some point the staff needed to spray the place with Mortein in order to prepare for the evening. I was extremely impressed by their consideration and thoughtfulness when they asked me to move outside with my baby, before they sprayed the place up. Of course, they assisted us in the move as much as possible and it wasn\u0027t inconvenient in the least bit. Third, when I left Xanders this morning, I noticed the valet had covered my steering wheel with newspapers so it won;t get hot. I was IMPRESSED and cannot give the owner a single suggestion on how the place can be improved! The food was outstanding, the service was impeccable, the decor and ambience is clean, fresh and modern.

This was a staff lunch for around 30 people, so we had the set menu.\n\nWhile we were waiting for the starters, we were served garlic bread accompanied by garlic butter and salsa. Unfortunately the crust was too dry and we had to ask for water to wash it down. I would suggest that the bread be sliced thinner.\n\nFor the appetizer, I had the chicken satay, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Skewered chicken can often be quite stringy, but this was very tender. The satay sauce delicately flavoured with pieces of peanuts in it and was just the right consistency to complement the chicken without overpowering it.\n\nHaving had chicken for the starter, I opted for the succulent stir-fried oyster beef for my entrée. I believe the regular menu mentions that this has basil, but it was not mentioned on the menu sheet that had been prepared for our group. Also, I had not expected the dish to be so spicy – the beef had a lot of chilli flakes in it and even the garlic rice had pepper in it so it couldn’t help to counter the spiciness. (I should add though that I have a very low spice threshold and other people at our table were OK with the dish.) Fortunately, the owner, Mr Hussain Tariq, came over just then to ask if the food was to our liking and so I told him honestly that it was too hot for me. He very kindly immediately offered to get me another dish instead. (I hate wasting food, but not being used to very hot dishes, I know I would have felt unwell if I had tried to finish the beef.) I asked for the grilled chicken in grain mustard sauce, which came quite quickly and was lovely. Just like the satay, the chicken was tender and balance of flavours just right to complement it.\n\nFor dessert, there was a choice of burnt caramel custard or blueberry crème brûlée. These tasted nice enough (though I think the crème brûlée needed to have set more), but were perhaps not exciting enough to consider going to CBG for just coffee and dessert. Also, I think the two choices for dessert on a set menu should be more different. I would suggest having a citrus or chocolate-based dessert as an option. The nice touch was that people who had to leave early got to take away their dessert.\n\nNow for matters other than the food itself.\n \nService: Fairly decent, considering the large size of our group, and that people came in and added their orders throughout the time. \n\nSpace: A little cramped while there were other groups (I thought the restaurant had been reserved for our lunch that day, but I might be wrong), but was okay once those other groups left.\n\nDécor: Loved it. Brightly lit with coloured (but not garish) lights. Carved plates, woodwork and paintings (including some by Mr Tariq himself) gave the place a cheerful rustic feel.\n\nSmoke: The big stumbling block. The place is too small to really escape cigarette smoke. I had to get up and move near the exit when a person in another group lit up to avoid having a coughing fit. I usually tend to eat out with my family, which includes very young children and other people allergic to cigarette smoke, and so being unable to avoid the smoke is likely to be a deterrent to visiting CBG, however good the food. I know that unfortunately restaurants in Pakistan struggle when they ban smoking, so perhaps an early evening time (e.g. 7 to 8.15/8.30) could be set aside as Family Time with smoking disallowed for that period only, allowing families to enjoy their meal comfortably without losing out on smoking customers in the peak hours.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T10:56:41+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-06T11:32:51+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"554760444","name":"Rushna Irfan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTY3OTc1MTc5","before":"NTU0NzYwNDQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"373852402665916","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Mariam Reza - Hope you are fine and doing well!!

I wish the weather were slightly better so we could sit outdoors, because the kind of racket these two separate huge groups of people were making, simply ruined our experience of such a serene setting. \n\nComing to the food, since I just wanted a light snack, I ordered Wasabi Prawns, to be followed by Tiramisu, and my husband ordered a regular cappuccino and Chocolate Fudge Cake with Vanilla Ice cream. It was rather disappointing to see just four medium sized batter-fried prawns placed on each corner of a rectangular platter with romaine and iceberg lettuce in the middle. Not just that, there was barely a hint of wasabi sauce brushed on top of the prawns. Rs 595 + tax for such a dish is a bit too steep by all standards! All I could think of at that time was Xander\u0027s OVERLOADED prawn sandwich! (which by the way, was what we had set out to eat initially, but the place was jam-packed and so I had the brilliant (?) idea of checking out Aylanto.) \n\nThe desserts fortunately were a saving grace and a half. The fudge cake was moist and dense, however, the ice cream was crystallized and even though we sent it back, the replacement was no better. My tiramisu was divine.. subtle balance of flavours, light and creamy . The coffee flavour was not overpowering but still made its presence felt. That is something I could go back to Aylanto for.. But I\u0027ll give it some time first to learn from and act upon the customers\u0027 feedback. \n\nThe service was fine, the manager was apologetic about the noise and commotion. Outdoors would be lovely once the weather improves. I really want to go back to Aylanto, hope they up their game soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T09:30:41+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-06T09:30:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"711699788","name":"Sanaa Zubairi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzExNjk5Nzg4","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}}}]}
