Dinner at Forty4 after a hiatus of more than a year, and failure to reserve space at Okra.  The place is meticulously done, with adequate lighting, formal (yet cozy) interior, and impeccable service.  \n\nThe menu is inventive, and is probably one of the better ones in the city.  More importantly, the place didn\u0027t have Moroccan Chicken, Tarragon Chicken, or any \u0027Chicken Steak\u0027 entree which shows that the management knows, and takes the food it serves seriously.  \n\nAnd yea, I was delighted to know that Forty4 has not jumped on the Wasabi Prawns bandwagon.  Was surprised to see tapas on the menu, which were pricier than Downtown Madrid, thereby defeating the whole spirit underlying tapas.\n\nThe menu is impressive, and demonstrates that the management has put in some serious effort in developing it.  All the prices on the menu ended with a \u00274\u0027, which makes mental calculation easier, and signifies management\u0027s attention to detail.  \n\nOrdered the Shrimp and Scallion Har Gow for starters, and the dumplings were delicious -- much better than that weird stuff that is served at Noodle House.  For the main course, the Beef Tenderloin was seasoned well, was succulent, and ensured that the \u0027meat\u0027 remained the star of the show.  Ordered it Medium-Rare, but was served Rare -- no complaints there, the rare it is, the better.  It was after a long time that I had some good ol\u0027 seasoned meat, with amazing sear marks.\n\nAbeer tried the Pasta44, and was delighted enough to exclaim \"If it wasn\u0027t for the power failure, I thought I was in Tuscany right now\".  The pasta was flavorful, and all the ingredients actually complemented each other.  Definitely one of the better pastas in the city.\n\nGot a 15% Discount on my RBS Credit Card, resulting in a per head cost of roughly PKR1300 -- which is fairly reasonable, given the quality of food served, and attentive service.  \n\nA flavorful experience.  Overall Rating -- 9/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-13T11:49:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-13T17:09:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501776623","name":"Shayan Shabbir Lakdawalla"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"787375286","name":"Zain Rauf"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"753624574","name":"Shazmeen Raza"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"683820727","name":"Aina Nasir"},{"id":"1423718906","name":"Saba Khan"},{"id":"677905296","name":"Shazia Carim"},{"id":"517470504","name":"Nida Ali"},{"id":"1510273456","name":"Daniyal Khalid"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"563320740","name":"Syed Tariq"},{"id":"524665437","name":"Saher Najam"},{"id":"635810442","name":"Kiran Afzal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjM1ODEwNDQy","before":"NTAxNzc2NjIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"633325330051954","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Excellent review.
