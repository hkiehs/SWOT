Got served the bread basket which was a delight to eat with its accompaniments. For drinks I ordered the very refreshing mint lemonade.skipped appetisers and moved directly to main course which was chicken with mushroom sauce- 2 orders,  - we asked for the mashed potatoes to be replaced by potato gratin, beef tenderloin steak,  chicken with jalapeno sauce and spaghetti with marinara sauce. The dishes were presented beautifully and the food vanished within no time. Apart from spaghetti in marinara sauce -which was found to be a little less flavorful - everything else was top class. We ordered a basket of fries which the server forgot to serve so we requested a cancellation but he insisted on it being complimentary and not only that but insisted on a complimentary bread pudding although we were planning to go to bella vita but the dessert was appreciated and enjoyed and the bella vita plan shifted to another day. All in all a very satisfying experience. Next time I\u0027m gonna go back for soup and salad.\nHT - I would like to make 2 observations/suggestions.  1. The menu which lists such divine and waiting to be ordered food is very plain and unattractive.  I don\u0027t mean to alter its look to anything fancy but it should definitely represent Cbg. 2. The table mats are made of paper so when a slushy drink such as my mint lemonade left a huge soggy patch on it and the mat required constant replacing .. maybe another type of material could be used for the table mats or you can keep coasters for drinks.  Other then that,  I\u0027m so glad cbg is back after closing its first operations and its better than ever.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-27T08:35:31+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-28T13:08:51+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"1048742368","name":"Aalia Mahboob Elahi"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"652674858","name":"Ali Allawala"},{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000093496883","name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"854940600","name":"Ozair Bilgrami"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODU0OTQwNjAw","before":"NjcwMTAwMTk4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"387151624669327","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Sarah Ashraf - Thank you for taking time out and writing this detailed review - so sorry could not come personally to your table, was busy doing the rounds of the catering site and attending few tables!!

Ordered a mixed berry smoothie and penne arrabiata. \nMy friend has ordered a Philly steak sandwich without onions And some starters for her son\n\nWhen she received her order it came with the onions, we asked the waiter to redo the order again....it came in good time...10ish mins but it was only 2/3rds the size of the one that came initially. Asked the waiter what was up with it and he said to just eat it and he would send some more sandwich in a bit... The sandwich still had some onions in it but my friend, who was expecting, couldn\u0027t wait n ate it. \n\nMy drink still hadn\u0027t arrived and I saw one of the waiters walking around with it.... I asked if it was the one I had ordered and he didn\u0027t say anything and walked away...5 mins later he comes n said it was mine but they made the wrong one for me...it was 3pm at that time....by the time he got it it was past 3:15.  Another 15 min later I see the same waiter walking around wid a dish....I was starving by that time since it was an hr since I had ordered... While the waiter was wlking with the dish he was frequently stopping to talk to other clients....I\u0027m sorry but I\u0027m not too keen on food being spoken over and images of spit flying over gross me out,...and sure enough the dish was mine....not only was it almost cold but they didn\u0027t even bring the garlic bread that comes with it...when asked, the waiter replies that the chef forgot to put it, so I asked why bring it out when u know it\u0027s not complete. \nThe pasta was a dismayal mini potion, (the size that comes in kids menu) at Rs 385...I would have liked a decent serving and not 20 pieces of penne. \n\nWe sat at the table for a good 20 mins after we had finished our meal and not a single plate was removed. We asked what happened to the sandwich the waiter had promised and he scurried out n got it but by that time none of us really wanted to stay there any longer. \n\nI wasn\u0027t too impressed with their service and their food system of running around looking for table numbers while food was getting cold. I find it very retarded. I never was tempted to try out the branch in sindi Muslim and I\u0027m not to keen on returning to this branch either until they work out the kinks","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-26T12:54:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-28T10:19:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1048742368","name":"Aalia Mahboob Elahi"},{"id":"559881298","name":"Nadia Mahasin"},{"id":"530103707","name":"Hina Dadwani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTMwMTAzNzA3","before":"NTA4OTIyNTA5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"386530801398076","from":{"name":"Najeeb Rehman","id":"749703456"},"message":"..dont hold your breath..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-26T12:59:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"386541088063714","from":{"name":"Basit Nasir Ahmed","id":"711705428"},"message":"Ali Nazim Aisha Basit","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-26T13:27:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"558255856","name":"Ali Nazim","type":"user","offset":0,"length":9},{"id":"1546481572","name":"Aisha Basit","type":"user","offset":10,"length":11}]},{"id":"386562774728212","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"What a horrible experience Zehra; i salute ur patience, I don\u0027t know how ppl can put up with this BS!
