The food arrived precisely at the time we had requested and even though we served it a half hour later it was still piping hot! Soup: great! Wontons: not that good, left kind of a flaky after taste that I dont quite know how to describe. The gravies we ordered were Sweet and Sour chicken and chicken with chillies and vegetables. Both were delicious as were the chowmein and chopsuey.
