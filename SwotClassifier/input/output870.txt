First, Tutti Frutti. Walked in with my bud, after making sure it wasn\u0027t too crowded. Enjoyed eying the toppings and immense variety of frozen yogurt options. I saw the mango flavor and made a bee-line for it. I like my fro yo straight up, so just took the mango and dug in. My friend turned his yogurt into a sundae, so I didn\u0027t touch that. The mango was nice, albeit clearly artificially flavored. After my friend tasted it, he compared it to peshawari ice cream. Happy, Taha? I added that it was without the creaminess which sticks to the roof of one\u0027s palate and coats the tongue. It was more on the tart side, and not really my thing. The rupee per gram and self-serve concept is pretty cool, though. A great addition to Karachi\u0027s fun places. Then, we walked over to Butlers, and got ourselves a Philly cheese sandwich which we shared. Honestly, it should\u0027ve been named something else. There were no onions, jalapeno, capsicum, and the cheese was definitely not Irish. It was thick, congealed and more difficult to chew than the meat, which wasn\u0027t very flavorful itself, but there was so much going on in there, the meat kinda disappeared. I suppose there are people who would enjoy it, such as my friend but me, not so much. The coffee however, was lovely. Thick, creamy foam on top, and strong, delicious coffee underneath. I do believe that the best was saved for last. Moved on to the Upper Crust for more fro yo (How could I not?) and lucky me, mango and Belgian chocolate were there today :D Of course I had to have both. And I gotta tell ya, that mango was just....and I\u0027m by no means being biased here, but mango was the bomb. The schnitzel (Taha again). The bomb diggity dawg. The shizz. Spot on. Rocking. And whatever other terms might come to mind when complimenting something out of this world. The Belgian chocolate was delicious as usual, but the mango frozen yogurt at Upper Crust was the star of today\u0027s show for sure.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-06T17:47:38+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-07T06:30:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"570766058","name":"Ayesha Saeed"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"643405172","name":"Sarah Ashraf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQzNDA1MTcy","before":"MTA2NjE3NjUxMA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"393664034018086","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"i think the girl likes mango FroYo","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T18:16:28+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393667197351103","from":{"name":"Nada Navid","id":"1621356970"},"message":"yep,that\u0027s what even i made out of this post :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T18:24:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393684984015991","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"I love mangoes.

We ordered Tacos, Quesadillas, and the Mexican sandwich which were truly scrumptious and a generous serving I must say. The cucumber / mint lemonades were absolutely refreshing especially in the afternoon heat. And the Toffee Brownie with Vanilla Ice cream was the cherry on the cake. Had a great time there and enjoyed Mexican food after a very long time. A must-try for all!!!\n\nHowever, I did have a few suggestions. Firstly, Mexican food is absolutely incomplete without black beans (baked or fried) and Mexican rice. Usually the main entrees are served with a side order of black beans and Mexican rice and well as much as we love French fries, they kinda/ sorta don’t go together. Secondly, guacamole / avocado is extensively used in Mexican food, especially the dip which was sorta lacking with the quesadillas and mind I say the dip definitely adds flavor to the food. Thirdly, could you add more Mexican dishes to the menu like chicken flautas, fajitas, chalupas and the like in the menu..oh also have the tacos in soft or hard shell. Just giving my 2 cents worth. \n\nCheers!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-02T17:25:41+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-06T16:05:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"512272922","name":"Natasha Ahmed"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"678500467","name":"Saba Shakeel"},{"id":"1091434889","name":"Haris Khan"},{"id":"100001375323502","name":"Rukhsana Malim"},{"id":"828190023","name":"Shaheen Nouman"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"100000522564819","name":"Imran Bahadur"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"512185530","name":"Sidra Shah"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA3NjI4NTIxNQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NTEyMjcyOTIy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"391294840921672","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"And after missing the quac.

The restaurant is cozy, calm and comfortable in the bustling karachi where you can sit, relax, enjoy and pamper your senses with the scrumptious food at a reasonable price. We ordered : mushroom and tarragon steak : 9/10 chicken cream soup: 10/10, chocolate nut sundae 9/10 and we also ordered the jalapeño poppers 8/10. Enjoyed both the meals. :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-06T14:47:58+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-06T15:25:40+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"603490700","name":"Mariam Bilgrami"},{"id":"1436448718","name":"Ambs Shah"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQzNjQ0ODcxOA\u003d\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"393589237358899","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Glad you liked Golden Dragon\u0027s food :) Look forward to serving you in the near future!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T15:25:40+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MzkzNTg5MjM3MzU4ODk5","before":"MzkzNTg5MjM3MzU4ODk5"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_393578624026627","from":{"name":"Tehniat Aftab","id":"544811222"},"type":"photo","created_time":"2012-06-06T15:01:39+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-06T15:01:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1473431885","name":"Syed Aamir Bukhari"},{"id":"501356389","name":"Ammara Haque"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAxMzU2Mzg5","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"picture":"http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/544832_495172983831104_661088061_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d495172983831104\u0026set\u003da.495172367164499.129216.226213184060420\u0026type\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_393432954041194","from":{"name":"De Joe","id":"597535350"},"message":"r we there yet","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-06T10:01:18+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-06T14:53:28+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"393493280701828","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Huh!!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T12:26:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393496524034837","from":{"name":"De Joe","id":"597535350"},"message":"its an ole joke","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T12:35:58+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393498757367947","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"I know.
