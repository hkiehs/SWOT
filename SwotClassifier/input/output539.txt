The main course however was Spicy Cheese Broast, Double Beef Burger Delight, Chicken Delux Burger and drinks. It was a big let down to see the fries (all of them) literally overcooked and dripping with oil, the broast was a sorry state of oil on top. The beef burger was an absolute delight to eat however the remaining food quality was very poor. I got embarrased infront of my friends as I had suggested the place to them.

It was a very bittersweet experience. \nOrdered at 8:30. Was told that the food would arrive at 9:15pm. After 9:30 had struck the clock, I called to be told that the rider had left and should reach in 15 min. 20 min later, I called again only to be told now that they had ruined the half pizza I had ordered and had been forced to remake it. Although I appreciate that they did not send out substandard food, it still upset me that by now it had been over 1hr and 15 min for the food to arrive.  (compared to the 40 min I was told). \nEventually another phone call resulted in the food being delivered at 10:10pm. Almost an entire hour after the delivery time. \n\nNow to the sweet part. I was happy that the food was warm and hot on arrival. We had ordered the full pizza deal and the half pizza deal. I loved their pepperoni and tikka stix, and the spicy buffalo wings were delicious! We had gone with the Fajita and the Beef pizza. Both were very good, extremely cheesy but not stingy with the toppings which is something I\u0027ve come notice is a problem most places. The toppings were also flavorful and it was fun dipping them in the sauces. The sauces that were served lacked a little punch. I asked for all 10 types but yet they sent me doubles so wasn\u0027t able to try the entire range. The jalapeno ranch and the smokey bbq sauces were great but the hot sauce wasn\u0027t spicy at all, and the peri mayonnaise was also lacking in flavor. \n\nAll in all a good value for money (Rs 3198) for 2 1.5 Coke, 1.5 20\u0027 Pizza, 2 orders of Stix (Pepporoni and Tikka) and 6 Wings and cumulative 15 sauces. \nI would\u0027ve been happier if they had been prompt with their delivery, but the customer representative was always extremely polite with me even when I was on the verge of losing my cool. \n\nWill be trying it again, however I\u0027ll probably order a little earlier next time to get some grace period.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-21T18:30:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-21T19:12:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"550220458","name":"Humayun Azhar"},{"id":"509315108","name":"Daniyal Qazi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5MzE1MTA4","before":"NTUwMjIwNDU4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"544778615573293","from":{"name":"Daniyal Qazi","id":"509315108"},"message":"I can totally relate to what haooened with you.
