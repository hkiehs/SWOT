Yesterday, my extremely generous friend Mr. Paracha of Orient Express fame offered to share a New Zealand ribeye steak that someone had presented him. Knowing my love of steaks, he prepared it and sent it to me tonight. Having eaten steaks all over the USA, Pakistan or anywhere I have been ... I can safely say this was among the best.\n\nFirst the sheer size was daunting and resulted in an exclamation that isn\u0027t able to be shared in polite company. However, one bite told me that this entire steak was going down tonight! I write this post even as I am struggling to stay composed because my stomach wants to know why I would eat a whole cow, no matter how delicious it was!\n\nThe taste was truly amazing and therefore the preparation, combined with the quality of the meat, made for an outstanding ribeye steak experience. Ribeyes are my absolute favourite steaks and given the chance, I always order one. It has been a long while since I had one that came close to this ... probably Morton\u0027s in DC in 2001! Frankly, I am struggling to see how I am going to enjoy another steak because every future steak is going to be compared to this one and somehow I do not see successful comparisons ... but hope springs eternal!\n\nI share because it seems selfish to enjoy such a meal without doing so. Ahhhhhhhh is the overriding sentiment at this moment along with tremendous gratitude to Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Paracha for sharing ... I am not sure that I could have been that generous but I am sure that I couldn\u0027t have made it taste as it did!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-14T16:11:08+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-14T16:11:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"513878303","name":"Shazeya Hadi Ghani"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"503886516","name":"Bilal Hameed"},{"id":"567181369","name":"Ifty Zaidi"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"864470709","name":"Syed Muhammad Taha Askari"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"1790757126","name":"Mehar Bano"},{"id":"517583112","name":"Rafia Farooqui"},{"id":"521690093","name":"Louie Sh"},{"id":"1476330208","name":"Zoha Sohail"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI5MzYxNzk3","before":"NTEzODc4MzAz"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_519707331413755","from":{"name":"Saira Qadri","id":"609681937"},"message":"Had Simple Dimple\u0027s Thai sweet chilli lime noodles (chicken).

I\u0027m sure by night time it would\u0027ve looked very romantic! The menu was limited which made it easier to choose. \n\nWe decided to order the chili fried prawns for starters along with vegetable chow mein and crispy beef in a birds nest as main. The prawns were yummilicious... the first bite had evoked moans of delight from me. It was lightly fried in some batter and sprinkled with crushed ginger and red chillies. The sauce along with the prawns was sweet and tangy.... the combination was quite divine... I loved it!! The beef was also quite good, neither too crispy nor too soggy and the taste was just right. I was a bit disappointed with the chow mein though... it had a typical \u0027desi\u0027 taste and too oily... \n\nOverall the experience was quite good and I wouldn\u0027t mind visiting the place again to try something different!
