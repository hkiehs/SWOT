I\u0027ve ordered it enough times to know that this is isn\u0027t a regular occurrence but i feel that i should highlight it so that it doesn\u0027t occur again.\n So i ordered Chicken Chowmein, Beef with basil and chilies, chicken in coconut cream and chili and prawn chili dry. The order arrived on time and was piping hot, but when i started eating i realized there was something off. The chowmein was bland, and by that i don\u0027t mean that it wasn\u0027t spicy, it just had no flavor (no instructions were given as to make it less spicy), doused it with the chili sauce and only then it was slightly eatable. The chicken in coconut cream and chili tasted like the coconut cream had gone bad (and i\u0027ve eaten it a couple of times to know what it tastes like). The only saving grace was the beef w/ basil and chilies which i enjoyed. The prawn chili dry was also eatable.\n  I understand that an eatery might be having an off day but it should not be the day when i am ordering in. I enjoy Chairman Mao and i feel that such bad experiences should not deter me from ordering again.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-02T07:15:20+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-02T20:45:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"1205101053","name":"Misbah Vaid Rizwan Hussain"},{"id":"513566148","name":"Falak Sher"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEzNTY2MTQ4","before":"NzEwNDcwODgy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"499346006783221","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Did you call back and let Chairman Mao know about your experience?

I am sure to most people who have been to “44” can back me on saying that the place has “ambiance”. Some aura in the air about it, that is almost indescribable about the ambiance. Its food and atmosphere can stand “almost” toe to toe to the best out there in Karachi. \n\nWe contacted the semi owner of the place Mr. Aman on Monday about the party to be hosted tonight. He invited us over to discuss the menu on which we decided on a buffet menu as following: \nHot \u0026 Sour soup \nThai Chicken Salad\nPapaya Salad \nHoney glazed BBQ smoked wings\nPan fried Sea bass with lemon thyme sauce\nRed Thai chicken curry\nChili \u0026 Basil Beef\nFried Rice \nRed sauce pasta (simple pasta olives and vegetables)\nFudge cake. \n\nNow my family was a bit skeptical that a restaurant that is not used to serve buffet will be able to manage it. Well the food was amazing the Hot \u0026 Sour soup was different from the usual out there and tasteful. Pasta was ordinary but that was expected. Fish \u0026 the beef get a special mention because everyone raved about it. \nNow you must have noticed the “almost” part in my heading. 44 lost out on two things one very small that is the refilling of the buffet was a bit slow but not so slow that you would cry over it. But the major disappointment was the dessert it was in fact what all our guests did actually complaint about, it was a huge disappointment it was dry, fudge was barely existent. And I really hope they improve on that part. All in all i would recommend the place but not for the dessert.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-31T11:24:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-02T10:14:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"871750088","name":"Adnan Rao"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"2320004","name":"Hassan Baweja"},{"id":"529620428","name":"Roomana Nasir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI5NjIwNDI4","before":"MTEzNTIzNjMzOQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"498497360201419","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Fair and thorough review.
