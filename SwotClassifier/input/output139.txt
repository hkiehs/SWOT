Had the misfortune of going to their Boat Basin branch. The queue was surprisingly short and my turn came in 10 minutes! Before i could even open my mouth to place my order the order taker cheekily said \"Sir Beef mei kuch nahi milega kyunke gas ka pressure nahi aa raha!\" I was like whaaaat??? Teething issues samajh mei aatay hain but if you cant provide customers with 2 of the 3 burgers currently in your menu then i am sorry you should have taken your time to open up rather than hastily opening 3 branches. More importantly you should have a proper gas connection instead of relying on gas cylinders!!!! No restaurant ever has came up with this dumb excuse. Ever! Needless to say i am not going back atleast to this particular branch. Seriously disappointed!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-13T20:21:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-14T08:28:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"561712779","name":"Syed Zohaib Hussain"},{"id":"509507958","name":"Omair Ahmed"},{"id":"625571272","name":"Fahad Hanif"},{"id":"738641022","name":"Sundus Shahid"},{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid"},{"id":"100003495204029","name":"Noman Faysal"},{"id":"512818995","name":"Nazia Ahmed Mirza"},{"id":"695844072","name":"Komal Waqar Ali"},{"id":"602358073","name":"Saad Ahmed"},{"id":"652568733","name":"Humair Abubaker"},{"id":"100000223684855","name":"Sana A.

Being a Pizzo regular, ordered my standard Deep Pan Pepperoni Pizza, and a Cheese Calzone.\n\nPepperoni Pizza is always a winner with a crunchy crust, just the right amount of sauce, and some amazing pepperoni.   But what was delivered today was a disaster.  They simply forgot the sauce in the pizza (there was barely any), the pepperoni looked depressed, and the crust was the worst I\u0027ve had in a while.  \n\nThe pizza represented something that one can get from a bakery, while shopping for eggs, and biscuits.  Disco bakery does a better pizza than what was delivered today.  I really enjoy the Pepperoni Pizza, but today it was horrendous.\n\nThe Cheese Calzone was excellent though.  Just the right quantum of marinara loaded with mozzarella.  Every bite was delicious, and if served hot can easily compete with the best ones globally.\n\nThe Pizza was a major disaster.  Hoping that Pizzo gets back its lost flavor, and I really don\u0027t want to lose my regular pepperoni fix.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-13T18:37:04+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-14T04:28:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"575220192","name":"Asad Ahmed Leghari"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTc1MjIwMTky","before":"NTA4OTIyNTA5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"633450653372755","from":{"name":"Arsalan Siddique","id":"560380437"},"message":"tu kitnaa khaata hai yaar?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-13T20:08:40+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"633656686685485","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Since that is my favourite Pizzo pizza too, I think they must have simply made a mistake since the one I got last night was outstanding!
