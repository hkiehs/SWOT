His attitude was more arrogant than the earlier waiter\u0027s and he just walked away caring two hoots.

Goat meat, for instance, is very clean in Pakistan and extremely healthy. Goats can\u0027t be farmed as effectively due to the prevalence of disease, and hence there is  little economic incentive to stick them with antibiotics and hormonal growth promoters. This is not to say that your local butcher does not do a little hanky-panky with the meat before selling it to you. Fish (depending on where it comes from) is another great source of protein.
