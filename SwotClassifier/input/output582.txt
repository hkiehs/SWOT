My sincerest apologies for your bad experience.  “Feeling like spitting out food” is never pleasant and next time, best thing would be to send the food back immediately and complain to management. Our aim is to make your dining experience pleasurable and I can assure you, the staff is very friendly and accommodating and would be happy to help, be it the food or the AC. \n\nI know it might sound like an excuse but it might have just been a one-off that happens to every establishment once in awhile. We would love for you to come back and we will see to it that you have a great experience with us. Your name is already at the reception. \n\nSumiaya Arif and Tabinda Salman Please do not reconsider visiting us due to 3 bad reviews. What about the other 60 good ones that don’t appear on this forum? I hope you will give us a chance.\n\nAbid Aziz Merchant: Forty4 is also the bread and butter for all the people involved in the eatery. Just like any other business, we strive for excellence and want to make spending all that money worthwhile and satisfactory. However, just like any other business, sometimes things can go a bit awry, blame it on human error.  \n\nHowever, I do agree that everything else takes a back seat to the food. Ali Mirza I appreciate you liking everything else but naturally, you are there for the food so I cannot stress enough how important it is to tell the staff if things are not to your liking so we can rectify the situation, effective immediately. \n\nRaheel Masood; Thank you for your suggestions for asking management to rectify the issues. The customer is always right and in following that age-old mantra, we are always here to better ourselves and make up for any mistakes. I hope we will be seeing you again. :) \n\nThe management at Forty4 has taken note of all these issues. Thank you for your feedback. I sincerely hope you will give us another chance and for those who have not yet visited, give us our first. :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-11T18:54:55+0000","like_count":15,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"585571679","name":"Kanza Ali","type":"user","offset":0,"length":9},{"id":"559845057","name":"Tabinda Salman","type":"user","offset":769,"length":14},{"id":"840619510","name":"Abid Aziz Merchant","type":"user","offset":945,"length":18},{"id":"504538403","name":"Ali Mirza","type":"user","offset":1344,"length":9}]},{"id":"517998348251320","from":{"name":"Ayesha Chundrigar","id":"665091820"},"message":"Kiran Murad, Owais Thanvi, Rabiya Syed, Maha Khan, I appreciate the vote of confidence from you all and hope to see you all there again! :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-11T18:57:08+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"672466884","name":"Kiran Murad","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11},{"id":"595996119","name":"Owais Thanvi","type":"user","offset":13,"length":12},{"id":"557225252","name":"Maha Khan","type":"user","offset":40,"length":9}]},{"id":"517999681584520","from":{"name":"Ayesha Chundrigar","id":"665091820"},"message":"Nezihe Hussain, here\u0027s hoping our restaurant makes it to another ten years with consistency and good food...I want my grandkids to eat there!
