However, despite our concerns, fate and some courage saw us at Oishi over the eid weekend. We started off with 12 pieces assorted sushi, the usual salmon, tuna, snapper, crabsticks, prawn, udon and the one curve ball, the eel. The fish was fresh and the sushi satisfactory, no complaints but Fujiyama is still the favorite. My wife and I were the only ones who wanted to try the eel, and I am glad we did, the eel sushi was extremely flavorful and I wished there was more. \n\nOver to the mains, two of us ordered the eid platter, one friend ordered beef teppanyaki, and another some chicken dish and I excitedly ordered the tempura udon. The eid platter included California rolls and 2 piece sushi, miso soup, tempura prawns/veggies and a surf \u0026 turf style teppanyaki. The rolls seemed a bit mayo heavy, the soup and the teppanyaki, however were done quite well. The tempura was done to perfection with a light, crispy batter accompanied by a delicious sweet chilli sauce. The friend with the chicken was not happy as the meat was overcooked and quite tough. As for me, well let’s just say it was completely not what I was expecting. The tempura udon is actually tempura prawns and veggies in miso soup along with udon noodles. This is a genuine Japanese dish and I am at fault for ordering without inquiring, but if there is one dish that stands against all my food beliefs, it’s this. I mean, you make perfectly good, crispy tempura, then, maybe out of hysteria at your own perfection, or fear or sheer madness you drown it in what is pretty decent miso soup, converting it into a soggy mess and destroying both in a single master-stroke. Then, you add egg noodles. I just couldn’t have it no matter what I told myself, each food has a purpose and it’s nobody’s business trying to mix and match. I shall restrain myself before I rant on, even though I slept wishing that someone would have added the word “Soup” at the end of Tempura Udon (This is still NOT Oishi’s fault). Overall, Oishi was a mixed experience and based on the tough chicken, average sushi, serving size and price, would not visit again and would rather go to old favorites, Fujiyama. However, if I can’t find the eel I might come back for a taste and would definitely order the tempura prawns. I am not too picky about ambiance, a good one earns points but I don’t mind if a place isn’t overcrowded, smell, smoky or noisy. For those who care, Oishi has beautiful seating outside, however, the top floor where we sat was seemed clinical. Closing comments: Oishi is a hit and miss, try it as an alternative, just make sure you know what you’re ordering :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-14T18:01:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-15T04:48:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"670475299","name":"Amal Zehra"},{"id":"894105612","name":"Ahsan Areeb"},{"id":"514605350","name":"Ruquia Jawed-Hammad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE0NjA1MzUw","before":"NTE2NTgyNjY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"603198056398015","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Eel is available at Sakura sometimes.
