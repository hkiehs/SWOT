Food arrived, I received it myself, tasted awesome... Life was good. \nUntil the next afternoon. A rider arrives at my house and rings the bell. Answered by the maid. He tells her he is here to receive \u0027payment for food\u0027. No further explanation. I was alone at home with my nephew, trying to put him down for his nap. Maid came to relay message and I told her I haven\u0027t ordered any food thinking there must be a genuine mistake. \nShe returns again saying the rider is insisting he talk to you and says please go see him at the gate. I was genuinely stuck with a cranky unwell nephew and didn\u0027t know what to do. \nDuring this process she hands over a dominos receipt of the previous days offer and obviously I\u0027m FURTHER confused. \nI called dominos from my cell and in the mean time also ask to speak to this guys manager on his cell.  Manager\u0027s name was Faisal ( of Dominos Shujaat Branch). \nI explained to him what is going on and he said the rider who delivered the food to me yesterday had conveyed to him that I had requested to pay a day later!!\nNext obvious question from my side was \u0027do you have a policy of handing over free pizza after an assurance of being paid a day later?\u0027 And \u0027even if you do, could you not have called me there and then to confirm if your rider is telling the truth??\u0027\nAt this , the manager retracted and apologized and I thought that was that. \nIt wasn\u0027t :-/\nRemember I was on call with the call centre on the other line? Well they looked into it and returned to me and said this Faisal guy had told them he had spoken to me himself and I had requested a latter day payment from him!!!\nI\u0027m flabbergasted! \nFirst time ordering from Dominis.
