One person posting about a bad experience they had at some restaurant etc, and then a million comments .Initially the discussion starts off on a low note, and soon becomes a heated arguement between two parties, each one insulting the other and getting all personal. I do not intend to talk about anyone specific over here, but guys, speaking for myself, i mostly end up on this group either when im looking for food suggestions and reviews or when i just want to be part of a discussion and read a few discussions amongst others. Who wants to see two people arguing over petty issues, and trying to have their word as the last. \nThis group, im sure was created out of the intention of serving as a platform of discusison, so that we can all experience good eateries and be aware of the not so good ones. And im sure there arent many of us who are under 18 and need to have the last word on everything or else throw a tantrum.\n\nThe only point i try to make here is that i wish we could tolerate a little freedom of speech, and not only expect it coming from others.This is  a group and every member is an equal part, and thus reserves the right to openly share their opinion without being attacked personally. I hope i have been able to make a point out of this page long post, and if someone gets offended, freedom of speech guys? :)\n\nGood day!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-07T14:38:43+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-08T06:18:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"500416023","name":"Maheen Meenai"},{"id":"100000545845896","name":"Sonia Ahmed"},{"id":"635183830","name":"Rashna Jaffer Shabbar"},{"id":"1655946149","name":"Imtiaz Merchant"},{"id":"100000416623123","name":"Imran Ali"},{"id":"512612823","name":"Leena Faruqui"},{"id":"600700316","name":"Emaad Shamsi"},{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"863275486","name":"Maimoona Abdullah"},{"id":"1407877011","name":"Huma Shamsi"},{"id":"1072105633","name":"Fatima Zaidi"},{"id":"513232132","name":"Nazia Latif"},{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"557216100","name":"Vikki Mohsin"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"1025016220","name":"Nabila Khawaja"},{"id":"769030393","name":"Muhammad Danniyal Jafri"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"508776548","name":"Meher Saigol"},{"id":"577409061","name":"Maaz Jamal"},{"id":"502393296","name":"Raheel Masood"},{"id":"585371256","name":"Muzammil Naeem"},{"id":"816005065","name":"Syed Hasan Meerza"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI5MzYxNzk3","before":"NTAwNDE2MDIz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_581781931872961/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNjI5MzYxNzk3"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"581785968539224","from":{"name":"Arsalan Khatri","id":"1074849551"},"message":"Just would like to add that if anyone indeed hate or dislike a specific eatery, please follow it with the experience or reason for that particular opinion.
