To my surprise, in less than hour after I commented, I got a phonecall from a Food Panda manager by the name of Haya, who was very apologetic and sincere, and repeatedly said that she hoped I\u0027d try Food Panda again and not have any complaints this time. I was pretty impressed by their diligence so today, I decided to give FP another chance. I ordered two sandwiches from Petaco\u0027s via FP, my total bill was Rs. 755. I gave the rider exactly Rs. 780, and instead of giving me Rs. 5 change, he asks for Rs. 50 more. I\u0027m very dreamy-minded and tend to miss the obvious so I checked the bill, and asked why I had to give Rs. 50 more. The rider then says that those Rs. 50 charges are for HIS delivery. Like, I already paid Rs. 100 for delivery, but the rider gets a special Rs. 50 tip. I called up FP and they picked up after MUCH delay. Thankfully I wasn\u0027t passed from one rep to another, they were prompt in getting someone to talk to me and I explained what was going on. The rep apologized and said I didn\u0027t need to pay any more amount at all and he\u0027d call the rider and speak to him. The rider didn\u0027t even return the Rs. 5 he owed me, btw. And I know the trolls will be commenting here saying its just Rs. 5, etc. but I\u0027m more pissed off on an ethical level. This was my third time ordering from Food Panda and honestly, one or two hiccup here and there is normal, I\u0027ve had them with Urbanite as well but this is just the limit! If anyone is thinking of trying out Food Panda, DON\u0027T! At least Urbanite will respond to you and apologize and their bad hiccups happen once or twice. Food Panda hiccups with each order, and the severity of their problems only increases with each incident.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-12T16:07:07+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-14T21:11:29+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1324057559","name":"Safi Ahmed"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1497320748","name":"Fauzia Farhan Hashmat"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"507563555","name":"Sara Omran"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"783958571","name":"Rabia Rajput"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"1406140922","name":"Sufyan Khan"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"100004754324237","name":"Usman Kabir"},{"id":"554875549","name":"Imran Siddiqui"},{"id":"882650316","name":"Sabah Shaikh"},{"id":"100001565357082","name":"Sinan Charania"},{"id":"605974561","name":"Aneeba F.
