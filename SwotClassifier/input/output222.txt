I love their muttons chops, bhindi and haandi the best! Went to the new Cafeela in Zamzama Lane 9, last night with an out of towner friend. Both of us had a cold and wanted something thai. We ordered some fried prawns and a hummus platter as starters which I have to be honest don\u0027t recall much since we were busy catching up on some gossip but tasted fine or else I would have definately remembered. My friend ordered the Thai baked fish and i played safe and ordered the Thai chicken in red curry. My friend liked his fish and I loved the curry! Servcie was very prompt and courteous.  We skipped dessert but was a relaxing and quiet dinner. Looking forward to some more Cafeela dinners soon!","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-07T17:54:56+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-07T18:28:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003243160835","name":"Shahbaz

I guess its okay, nothing spectacular, but not disappointing either. \r\n\r\nNext time: I\u0027ll try pizza and then brownie with Belgium  icecream (if they have it)\r\n\r\nBtw, it was packed at around 12:30 am today!","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-06T21:27:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-07T17:04:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"100003533323814","name":"Sarah Muhammad"},{"id":"887810323","name":"Aicha Zahid Randhawa"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"100003436586217","name":"Asim Shafi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAzNDM2NTg2MjE3","before":"NjI4NDkxNjc0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"615007465217074","from":{"name":"Aisha Talha Farooqui","id":"100001165528409"},"message":"Friday night buzz.. next time try the brownie (if they have it in stock) either with Belgium chocolate or chocolate fudge!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-06T21:31:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615008138550340","from":{"name":"Sohail Kamran","id":"1254183890"},"message":"sure will..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-06T21:34:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615009688550185","from":{"name":"Muhammad Ahmad Azfar","id":"571951019"},"message":"I kinda (really) liked their Decadence cake.
