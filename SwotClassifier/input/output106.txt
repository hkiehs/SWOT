I went to OPTP DMTR today and I was utterly surprised to see the staff there. They were loudly talking in a \"Tu Tara\" manner among themselves. \"Aye inko fries dede pehle, aye daant andar rakh kaam kar jaldi\". They looked untrained and uneducated. Oh well as long as I get my order I dont care. Just as I was observing them, a goodlooking lady came to the counter to place her order and the cashier went absolutely ga ga, he started passing ridiculously obscene comments about her to his fellow their at the counter. I found it extremely unprofessional and disgusting! I feel the management of OPTP has changed about a few months back just after they discontinued their Gourmet Fries (which I miss alot). And after all this the fries that I got were alot more golden than I usually like.

A friend of ours wanted to order a low-fat, grilled item specifically, and the friendly owner was most helpful in suggesting a few options out of which she chose the Chicken Chimichurri, which was truly delectable. The Buffalo Tenders in the appetizer trio were my favorites! We also ordered a hot chocolate (which was a bit of disappointment), and a vanilla shake. Last but not the least, we ordered the Red Velvet Cake - the perfect ending to the lunch.\nThe waiters were very courteous, its a neat place and I\u0027m definitely going back there to explore other items on the menu!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-04T18:13:51+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-05T13:15:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"579815464","name":"Asad Ali"},{"id":"790617927","name":"Misha Abid Mallhi"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"622624323","name":"Mansoor Teli"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

First on the list was Fish hot and sour soup (white) which was the appetizer followed by the Dhaka finger fish the all time favorite, Jumbo prawn tempura and then the legendary Leather Jacket fillet in green masala, Fish Behari boti a new entrant as i had not tried it before, Pangush Boti Karahi,Chicken Fried Rice, Kids meal Crispy Chicken Burger Zinger,Garlic Nan, cold drinks and mineral water.\n\nOK, now for the mixed reviews i had been reading about Bots, well yes its has changed, it has evolved for the better and now is a proper food street fine dining dhaba style restaurant :)\nLimca stall was their earlier, now their a doc juice shop, i don\u0027t know the name of the doc but its good,dai bara stall and a pan stall plus loud music playing so the ambiance was definitely lively and more festive.\n\nNow coming to the revision in prices, yes their has been an slight increase in cost due to 16% GST but they are GST registered and the GST/SNTN is S3966140-7 and my bill had an addition of Rs.500, but rest assured it is being deposited in the national exchequer 100% which is cumulatively a substantial amount.\n\nThe real increase in prices is not that much considering they are delivering on quality and quantity, the fish was fresh, juicy, well marinated and had great flavor, as good as in the past if not better. The chatnis and the lemon add to the flavor too.\nThe service was quick and the food was served piping hot. Only one dish that was the Pangush Boti Karahi lacked flavor and was quite bland, i think that needs to be worked on and can improve with some minor adjustments.\n\nLadies and gentlemen Bots is known as the best seafood Dhabba in Karachi and upgraded its position now to a \"food street fine dining dhaba style restaurant\"\nnot a bad deal considering that a similar meal at a fine dining seafood joint would cost you 60% more with the frills and fancies, but as far as I am concerned the core issue is the product, and as long as I get value for money in terms of quality and quantity I am a happy camper indeed and plan to return to Bots soon for another round of scrumptious sea food delicacies.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-03T22:13:06+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-05T06:30:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"100000674735601","name":"Muhammad Patel"},{"id":"1004056348","name":"Zaryab Shaikh"},{"id":"100001433820134","name":"Hasan Raza"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"1413795365","name":"Hiba Jamali"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"521735682","name":"Aamir Shahnawaz"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"593601228","name":"Muhammad Saifullah"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100000446704703","name":"Almas Mehmood"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"564100900","name":"Fawad Hai"},{"id":"645099594","name":"Mujahid Iqbal"},{"id":"100002698452985","name":"Rabia Mahmood"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjk4NDUyOTg1","before":"MTE5ODgzMTM3Ng\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"644634672254353","from":{"name":"Mahad Mustafa","id":"805150435"},"message":"Syed Zulfiqar Ali Kazmi!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-03T22:58:39+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"585210551","name":"Syed Zulfiqar Ali Kazmi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":23}]},{"id":"644851935565960","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Oh I see it now.
