Not being big eaters, yet wanting to try several items on the menu, we ended up ordering lettuce wraps as an appetizer ( excellent!), turkey jalapeño pizza ( just perfect), Gouda burger ( patty was grilled to perfection ) \u0026 chocolate tart (yummy!). We thought that there was no way that 2 people could do justice to this much food, but boy, oh boy, we ate almost all of it. The staff \u0026 owners were extremely attentive \u0026 courteous, the ambience simple yet appealing, the food impeccable. What I simply loved about this place was that they had many healthy options \u0026 variations.. For example you could get a fresh salad with the burger instead of fries, or have fresh fruit with granola \u0026 honey as a dessert. The salads were crisp \u0026 fresh \u0026 not drenched in dressing. The food quality indicated high quality ingredients. In all, I was thoroughly satisfied with my meal \u0026 given that they have an attractive children\u0027s \u0026 breakfast menu, and a non smoking area,  I will definitely be a frequent visitor at the Pantry.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-15T18:41:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-18T12:32:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"100000144649501","name":"Durray Sadaf"},{"id":"1268142470","name":"Monty Mashooqullah"},{"id":"684670075","name":"Maham T.
