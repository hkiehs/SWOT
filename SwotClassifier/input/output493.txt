uncooked veges, italian chicken was fried and extremely oily yet atleast tasted better, cake was ok and for sure wasnt prepared by the chef. above all, it was damn humid in there as the ac\u0027s were

It was a nice enough place and the service was attentive. The food was a disappointment because it just didn\u0027t taste that good. There wasn\u0027t anything \"bad\" to say but it really was not comparable to what one expects at a good restaurant. The limited selection of chicken dishes was a problem for Mariyam Masood, and funnily enough, another couple walked out for the same reason after reviewing the menu. The appetizer of boneless chicken was bland without major amounts of dipping sauce and was pretty dried out \u0026 solid in consistency. My gouda burger was alright but there are plenty of significantly better burgers around. Mariyam\u0027s chicken sandwich in olive bread was similarly alright but she didn\u0027t particularly enjoy it. As I said, we didn\u0027t have anything \"bad\" to say about the food or the place, and service was prompt and good ... but it was not an experience that made us want to go back there unless we hear of major changes!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-25T15:12:17+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-27T08:34:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQwNjE5NTEw","before":"NTI1MzMxMjgx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"561982257186262","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"My experience of the Gouda Burger was good and I lived the Chocolate Tart.

The CT was cooked to perfection with a side of mash jst as i had asked and the Mushroom burger was delightful and was exactly as described.
