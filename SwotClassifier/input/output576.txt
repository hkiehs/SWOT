Special WOK Soup (white) is refreshingly different in taste from other special soups being offered by Chinese food outlets. Butterfly Prawns for starters were excellent. Prawns were of good size and just the right amount of batter. We were recommended fried fish with crumbs by the order taker (not in menu I guess) and although it\u0027s not really Chinese food but perhaps best fried fish you can have in Karachi. I requested for something in beef and was suggested Beef Bulgoki, another stellar dish which was adequately spiced, and meat was tender as compared to any normal Beef Dry Chilly. Thai Chowmein is also a great offering for people with taste for Chowmein, again a recommendation from the gentleman who took order. I found WOK great in terms of value for money as portions were generous (specially rice) and food arrived well in time (about 35 minutes, but then I live in Clifton) and in piping hot condition. Definitely a must try for Chinese food fans.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-20T07:12:40+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-20T07:12:40+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"656462656","name":"Mustafa Ahmed"},{"id":"585054134","name":"Helal Enver"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTg1MDU0MTM0","before":"NjU2NDYyNjU2"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_523203491064139","from":{"name":"Faisal Naseer","id":"780902784"},"message":"Happy tummy.
