Perfect weather and time of day for a leisurely stroll up and down the broadwalk. Decided on the Aylanto Bistro, drawn by its very mod glass facade. Scanning the Menu kept outside when joined by young and intrusive waiter who insisted on giving me a running commentary, having come to the conclusion no doubt that I was faking it and looked like the type who couldn\u0027t read. Even more offensive was his casual \u0027hands in the pocket\u0027 manner. Anyway, ordered Shrimp Vegetable Soup-of-the-day. Excellent. Followed it up with a Classic Beef Burger. Thick juicy pattie, and all going well until encountered unchewable bits in the pattie testifying to the presence of \u0027charbi\u0027 in the mincemeat. Terrible! and very irritating having to spit it out. French fries scored passing grade, but the thick creamy white sauce in the burger interfered with the taste of the pattie, and kept it slipping in between the buns at crunch time. Smart, well appointed and clean toilet. But there were issues with the Menu comprising black fonts on dark blue background making for a difficult reading proposition. Black fonts on white backgrounds please. Keep it simple. Also, your printer needs a new cartridge. Could barely make out the bill. And now that you have a view of the Creek, its time to clean up the Creek. It\u0027s embarrassing, specially if you\u0027re with an overseas guest.","type":"photo","created_time":"2011-12-12T17:29:03+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-13T17:12:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"756666353","name":"Yawer Shameem"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwMjQ1MDc0MTk1","before":"NzU2NjY2MzUz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"277054605679030","from":{"name":"Tanya Azmi","id":"505248635"},"message":"Adil Ahmad, i apologize for the over enthusiastic waiter - regarding the burger - this is one of our most popular items will definitely look into the matter and have it solved.

I tried Chicken Taco...big portion and great in taste...totally hooked up with Cuccumber lemonade (a must try, Unique taste)...highlight of the night was the chilli garlic sauce cheif specially made for us!! We wanted some chili sauce beside regular Tabasco or Chinese chili sauce...the guy in the kichen mixed a few spices and herbs and come up with his own chilli sauce which was a total treat!! Will go again for sure!!","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-13T11:37:13+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-13T15:52:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"615046216","name":"Sadiq Kamdar"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"859775626","name":"Saba Musharrif"},{"id":"537275209","name":"Faisal Iftikhar"},{"id":"686712045","name":"Irfan Aslam"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"775425216","name":"Imran Muhammad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nzc1NDI1MjE2","before":"NjE1MDQ2MjE2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"277214342329723","from":{"name":"Hifza Shah","id":"512091261"},"message":"Thank you Danish Raza hope to see you again!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-13T15:52:49+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"578840177","name":"Danish Raza","type":"user","offset":10,"length":11}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mjc3MjE0MzQyMzI5NzIz","before":"Mjc3MjE0MzQyMzI5NzIz"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_276608682390289","from":{"name":"Faiza Nathani Sagheer","id":"850315404"},"message":"Box of 6 red velvets up go grabs tomorrow ... contact Baker\u0027s Avenue ( Faiza Nathani Sagheer @ 0321-2415522) and book your order before its late  :)","type":"photo","created_time":"2011-12-12T18:11:09+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-13T15:20:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"508976973","name":"Shanaya Shahpur Maneckji"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA4OTc2OTcz","before":"NTA4OTc2OTcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"277042079013616","from":{"name":"Shanaya Shahpur Maneckji","id":"508976973"},"message":"Yum yum Faiza.... i want to gobble it up as usual :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-13T10:01:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"277201125664378","from":{"name":"Faiza Nathani Sagheer","id":"850315404"},"message":"hahahaha.... coming up with exciting offers for christmas ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-13T15:20:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mjc3MjAxMTI1NjY0Mzc4","before":"Mjc3MDQyMDc5MDEzNjE2"}}},"picture":"http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/378375_10151031810425405_623037420_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10151031810425405\u0026set\u003dgm.276608682390289\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_275932339124590","from":{"name":"Hina Hasnain","id":"541645222"},"message":"Where does one find good peking duck in Karachi?","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-11T17:29:05+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-13T15:10:46+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"275939705790520","from":{"name":"Jawad Hai","id":"600315056"},"message":"i believe dynasty in avari have that on their menu, havent tried it thought","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-11T17:43:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"275939749123849","from":{"name":"Jawad Hai","id":"600315056"},"message":"though*","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-11T17:43:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"275951069122717","from":{"name":"Haya Emaan","id":"508497032"},"message":"local is available through out - but for imported a 24 hr notice","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-11T18:07:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276372925747198","from":{"name":"Erum Zehra","id":"100001677628921"},"message":"Is imported worth the wait?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T10:11:48+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276468482404309","from":{"name":"Haya Emaan","id":"508497032"},"message":"its also triple the price. and some might say its worth the wait \u003dD depends on the wallet","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T14:37:25+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276533652397792","from":{"name":"Adnan J.

I should mention that they major complaints regarding them is the issue with their phone lines, that they never pick up. I must tell you that the phone lines business is definitely not their fault. PTCL has screwed them over badly, and not just once. The security downstairs, is not Atrium Cinema\u0027s security but the Mall\u0027s itself. Atrium Mall and Cinema are two separate entities. \n\nNow if you\u0027ve had complaints regarding the service at the cinema itself, you should have talked to the manager there whose always available on the floor. And for bigger issues, the owner is also ALWAYS there, in the back that is. DHA Lahore cineplex is owned by the same people that own Atrium Cinemas, and also Nishat. They\u0027ve been in the business for quite a long time and trust me they\u0027re definitely the best in the business.
