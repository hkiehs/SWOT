We had to wait for around a quarter of an hour before any proper seating arrangements were given to us. I ordered a Cream Tikka Pizza based on the reviews i read on Swot. To my surprise they delivered it within 10 minutes and everything was perfect about it,Although my little brother felt that there were less topping of chicken pieces on it but i was completely satisfied by it. One thing which pissed me off was that all the bottles of sauces were uncapped. I called the waiter and asked him to bring new capped bottles and stopped him to takeaway those uncapped ones. Other than that everything was good and acceptable. \nI will rate the food 9 out of 10 and the place 2 out of 10\n\nPlus they need to focus more on hygiene . Customers like me are not easily pleased.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-13T19:44:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-14T09:41:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"602946906423130","from":{"name":"Buland Iqbal Burney","id":"100000430891226"},"message":"critics.............. lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-14T08:36:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602963499754804","from":{"name":"Shareq Rehman","id":"577118901"},"message":"hahah","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-14T09:41:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAyOTYzNDk5NzU0ODA0","before":"NjAyOTQ2OTA2NDIzMTMw"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_602921339759020","from":{"name":"Shahjehan Maniar","id":"745945065"},"message":"Any suggestion and recommendation for RED EMPEROR ???","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-14T06:53:55+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-14T09:24:20+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"602944093090078","from":{"name":"Saad Ansari","id":"702935789"},"message":"yeap, go for golden dragon or chairman mao instead","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-14T08:25:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602948756422945","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"Order emperors  chicken kindo fish and garlix prawns","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-14T08:44:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602952553089232","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Shahjehan Maniar prawn toast and hot n sour soup r totally yumm!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-14T08:58:16+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602954546422366","from":{"name":"Muhammad Hammad Ab","id":"852905477"},"message":"Emperor chicken ...

And it was good service.\n\nOn the sehri of the last roza, which was early morning-ish Thursday, 8th of August, I decided to order BROADWAY PIZZA. I had tried it before and really liked it. I placed the order at 2:15 AM for a large pizza deal, half chicken sausage and half pepperoni. My parents don\u0027t like pepperoni at all so they wanted smoked chicken, but they had run out of it so they chose chicken sausage instead. For heavy sides we chose supreme chicken garlic bread.\n\nAt the time this order was placed, we were informed it would take 45-50 minutes, but they will probably deliver before that. The order arrived at 3:45 after calling them 4 times to make sure the order is actually coming so we could make alternate arrangements if it wasn\u0027t do-able. And when it arrived, it wasn\u0027t at all what we ordered. The whole pizza was pepperoni, the vegetables were not what we asked for and the garlic bread tasted 4 days old. Not only was it late, but it was inaccurate as well. And since it was last minute, it was too late to make any other arrangements. My usual habit is to check what I get before handing over the payment. And when I realised the blunder, I called them up while standing with the rider who brought the order. On the receipt it said what I ordered, but the food didn\u0027t match the receipt. \n\nUpon calling them, I was told I would get a replacement for the order and that I should keep what I got without any payment and whenever I was ready, that I should order again and pay the bill at that time. I was IMPRESSED because that kinda service is unheard of in this country. The manager told the rider to just come back. Now when I got over the shock of such a statement, I didn\u0027t feel right because I don\u0027t like taking anything for free. So I just told the manager dude that I would give half the money now, and I will give the remaining half when he fulfilled his replacement promise another day. \n\n5 days later, I called them to take up their offer. And they recognised me as if they were waiting for me to call them. And voila! Everything was delivered as promised, on time and perfectly cooked. Just to let you know, we got one HUGE chicago style pizza (enough for 6-8 people), 6 chicken wings, tikka sticks (which were amazing), 1.5 litre drink and TEN sauces (each one of them equally good) for Rs. 2100! I ofcourse paid the half that I owed from before but even then, it is an awesome deal. And as far as the quality of the food is concerned, I don\u0027t think I have had a better pizza in karachi so far.\n\nImpeccable service and amazing food. What more can anyone ask for? Bravo BROADWAY PIZZA for a job well done! You just got yourself a customer for life (or atleast till whenever I feel fat enough to quit pizza altogether).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-14T06:15:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-14T09:12:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"586560258","name":"Zehra Alidina"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1454993708","name":"Tehniyat K.

We were 5 friends and since the place is \"known\" for its steaks we all ordered it. I ordered Arizona Fire Steak which by name seemed Arizonas specialty, when my order arrived, which was in due time and served in correct temperature, it was the opposite of what I expected. By \"fire\" I thought it would be something hot, saucy, spicy but when platter was placed in front of me I wasn\u0027t sure I was at Arizona. The presentation was zero, it looked like a piece of dry meat placed in a platter with mashed potatoes to go with it, which looked liked uncooked pizza dough, and few boiled vegetables on the other side. Too unprofessional. Anyways I started to eat still hopeful that it might not taste the way it looks, but that was disappointment too. The taste wasn\u0027t that bad but nothing extraordinary. The mashed potatoes were too salty, out of all the things on it i liked the boiled vegetables :P. Then we ordered dessert which was Chocolate Silk Pie. It arrived with same, unappetizing presentation. The taste was good but there was nothing silky! Infact the bottom layer was so hard that I might have to stand up on it to break it. \nSo my experience at Arizona was really bad. after paying such a big amount I still left with half stomach empty. The staff was good and co-operative. Good service. But who goes to restaurant for the good service only?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-13T18:21:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-14T01:48:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001882596023","name":"Mansoor Zaheer"},{"id":"673197577","name":"Syed Talha Khurshid"},{"id":"559881298","name":"Nadia Mahasin"},{"id":"100001420487264","name":"Saqib M Ibrahim"},{"id":"651245042","name":"Falak Zahid Sheikha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjUxMjQ1MDQy","before":"MTAwMDAxODgyNTk2MDIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"602689159782238","from":{"name":"Faryal Naqvi","id":"739670623"},"message":"sadly arizona has really detoriated over time","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T18:25:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602691326448688","from":{"name":"Xaraa Aar Kay","id":"100001611544621"},"message":"the last time i went to Arizona.. it was Awesome!\ni went to Arizona at Atrium Mall...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T18:31:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602691796448641","from":{"name":"Sarah J.

We arrived with big appetites and high expectations. For starters we ordered the flame grilled soya marinated beef. We inhaled the dish in about 12.4 seconds. The beef was moist, tender and bursting with acidic flavors. After that, the wait for the main course seemed a bit long but it was most probably the pent up anticipation. Then the red curry chicken with chili lime and steamed fish in chili and garlic sauce arrived. Wow. Absolutely unbelievable flavors. The curry was rich and creamy as promised and the fish reminded me of the road-side steamed fish in garlic and lime sauce from Bangkok. I was in heaven. Rather, I was in Bangkok again. The service was impeccable and the experience was perfect. If I were to nitpick, I think the portion sizes are appropriate for two but a little small for 3-4 diners. With that said, the entire meal came to less than Rs. 2000 so I dare not complain. Needless to say, the waiter got a big tip and I came home with an even bigger belly :) Fuchsia","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-13T18:16:50+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-13T23:59:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"514017528","name":"Omar Kazmi"},{"id":"759420423","name":"Huzefa Marvi"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"582076905","name":"Obaid Sattar"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"617601286","name":"Insia Iqbal"},{"id":"639961936","name":"Moiz A.
