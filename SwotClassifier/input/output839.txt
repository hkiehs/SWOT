They were sweet enough to give us an amuse-bouche (I got excited cause I remembered when Chandler from friends tried it) of beef with rocket and something else that tasted like chicken.. their bread basket was so good i think we slightly filled up on it a bit much- cause the garlic butter served with it went so well with it..For starters we had chicken money bags. quite the cute these fried dumplings were, beause they were actually shaped like money bags out of a cartoon heist.. for which they gave with an assortment of sauces to go with, one was spicy, one was garlicy and the other a sweet hoison sauce.. i reallyreally loved my steak with chardonnay sauce. Whoever cooked it knew exactly how to get a medium-rare just perfect. It came with not one but TWO sides.. I chose potatoe zuchini gratin and potatoe wedges... I\u0027m a sucker for gratin and this is the best ive tasted so far... and The blackened honeyed hoison beef tenderloin tasted like what I hear is the next best thing to General Tsao\u0027s chicken... which is what we were kind of hoping for. Only thing was it wouldve been better on rice rather than rice noodles. Overall it was like eating out of Masterchef kitchen- so much YUM! \n\nAlso, and I cannot stress this enough- they played the perfect music. instrumental up-beat jazz. Its good enough to enjoy as background music, and not distracting enough to pull away from the conversation.

The staff was so attentive and polite. Everything was pretty much perfect- the food, the ambiance, the service!! The bread basket, chicken mouse and rice cakes were absolutely delicious. For the main course I had chicken steak in rosemary sauce which was soft, juicy and the best steak I have had so far.. the watermelon juice was very refreshing. I was so full after having all this but still wanted to try the dessert so had the bread and butter pudding parceled which I enjoyed to the last bite! would definitely go there again :D","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-23T13:29:08+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-23T13:29:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"1108385601","name":"Marvi Jatoi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NjY1MDkxODIw"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_402246919826464","from":{"name":"Mehr Azeem","id":"562192428"},"message":"Hey!
