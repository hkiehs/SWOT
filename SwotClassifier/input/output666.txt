Zipped through the short and simple menu of snacks , great to keep lebanese snacks menu not too long. So i went ahead and ordered it lastnight . Delivery time was not mentioned on the telephone but it came within the expected around 40minutes, well packaged, piping hot. My sister ordered the hot dog saaj , and my order was the mortadella and cheese saaj, we ordered the honey and sugar saaj bites as dessert and a potato saaj as a tester for my mum to try out later. \nIt was very disappointing to eat a \"saaj\" that is supposed to thin bread was basically our very \"naan\" heated probably on grill , folded and stuffed with tomato sauce (ketchup) , way too much of it. I didnt notice it till i opened the whole wrap up , turned it over and saw that it was naan . The dessert bites were burnt and too thick. :( \nMy eager wait for some arab food connection was totally diminished, my sister and i eventually ended up eating home cooked food. \nSorry Saaj bite , these are not lebanese snacks.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-05T08:57:57+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-08T15:24:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002785190370","name":"Vseem Gaved"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNzg1MTkwMzcw","before":"MTAwMDAyNzg1MTkwMzcw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"484831448234677","from":{"name":"Haaris Anwar","id":"519185625"},"message":"give Arab Connection a shot, its inspired by Al-Tazaj , middle eastern fast food:p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-08T15:24:03+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"272653896108977","name":"Arab Connection","type":"page","offset":5,"length":15}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDg0ODMxNDQ4MjM0Njc3","before":"NDg0ODMxNDQ4MjM0Njc3"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_484709098246912","from":{"name":"Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi","id":"684515056"},"message":"LIVE chat/Q\u0026A with UK-based Celebrity Food Blogger Pukka Pakistani as she talks about her mission to put Pakistani food on the world map! \n\nThis is a great opportunity for budding food bloggers, writers \u0026 photographers to connect with her and learn the tricks of the trade!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-08T08:40:58+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-08T14:19:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"579351039","name":"Nazzia Momina"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"502436694","name":"Batool Habib Curmally"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAyNDM2Njk0","before":"NzE3NzYwNjU4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"484766878241134","from":{"name":"Shoaib Taimur","id":"687580830"},"message":"I can\u0027t wait. she is a lovely person and a good friend.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-08T12:16:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"484808741570281","from":{"name":"Shoaib Taimur","id":"687580830"},"message":"have been doing that :) hope others do so as well. let me do that on twitter.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-08T14:18:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"484809014903587","from":{"name":"Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi","id":"684515056"},"message":"Thanks :) Let\u0027s support her in her mission to putting our gorgeous food on the world map!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-08T14:19:15+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDg0ODA5MDE0OTAzNTg3","before":"NDg0NzY2ODc4MjQxMTM0"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_484771768240645","from":{"name":"Zara Zahid","id":"100000372514965"},"message":"a good place to arrange a party for 150 people in Karachi can be?\npls help.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-08T12:35:14+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-08T12:35:14+0000"},{"id":"165861103465048_484425574941931","from":{"name":"Maryam Zahoor Ansari","id":"736425186"},"message":"Does any one know where I could get banana chips in Karachi?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-07T17:57:17+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-08T12:11:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1683849703","name":"Uzma Saeed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTY4Mzg0OTcwMw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTY4Mzg0OTcwMw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"484441528273669","from":{"name":"Rizwan Moosa","id":"695280170"},"message":"Try Sunday Bazar.
