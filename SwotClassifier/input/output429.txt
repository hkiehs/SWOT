Was pleasantly surprised. A humble environment but very neat and clean. My wife and I are on a moderate diet so we grilled the server about dishes that could be served without rice and noodles. Instead of throwing his hands up (like so many people do nowadays), he smartly suggested the drier dishes (Kung Pao Chicken and Fish in Tamarind sauce). For starters we got the hot and sour soups. The soups were not bad but the stars were the main dishes. Fresh, tasty and packed full of flavor - the taste was a departure from the wasteland of Pakistani-styled Chinese dishes. Overall, not overly spicy either, which is always appreciated. Overall, if you\u0027re looking for good Chinese food without the frills, The Lantern is a great place to be. Good food. Great service and a quaint atmosphere to boot. Good job guys.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-04T08:45:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-04T14:29:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001882596023","name":"Mansoor Zaheer"},{"id":"506243943","name":"Saud Ahmed"},{"id":"512612823","name":"Leena Faruqui"},{"id":"829355187","name":"Sadaf Sarwar"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"100000087144502","name":"Nadia Nadeem"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"570778381","name":"Safia Ali"},{"id":"514286144","name":"Lamaan Malik"},{"id":"502280426","name":"Husnain Zahid"},{"id":"571870541","name":"Faizan Yousuf"},{"id":"645995992","name":"Rida Sadiq"},{"id":"1382454645","name":"Shariq Jamil"},{"id":"647041983","name":"Haseeb Chaudhry"},{"id":"649049339","name":"Basit Saeed"},{"id":"639961936","name":"Moiz A.
