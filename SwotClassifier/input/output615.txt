As usual.\n\nA friend of mine who is a recent return from Down Under was very frustrated with the negativity he was seeing all around Karachi. So I decided to show him the finer things Karachi had to offer. With me, the finer things always begin with food. Duh! So since he and I both enjoy seafood, Hook Line and Sinker was the way to go. Having been there once before, I knew the ambiance, service and quality of the food itself would definitely be a good experience. Although we had made dinner plans, we ended up going to lunch, since there was a family dinner I couldn\u0027t manage to wiggle my way out of. I do believe that was the first day of lunch service, and what a lunch it was! \n\nUpon entering, I met the charming Haider Zaidi, and after the introductions, he took me around on a small tour of HLS. It was beautifully done, and the sofas in the cigar lounge looked exceptionally comfy. I could just imagine myself curled up in a corner with a good book and a cup of coffee. The deck seemed like such a wonderful, cheerful place, but was closed unfortunately, because there was some repair work being done in a neighboring house, which was causing a whole lot of noise. So we chose to sit inside the dining area, where we could actually see the kitchen! My friend was most impressed, as was I. Once we got settled in, we ordered the grilled calamari, seafood chowder and Prawn ala Rooni for me, and the Red Snapper with Pepper Onata for my friend. Although there was a bit ofa hiccup with the calamari, which I told Haroon about once I got home, the flavor was sharp, spicy, and tangy. Then came along the seafood chowder and our mains. I have already raved about my food in a previous post, and my friend also thoroughly enjoyed his meal. Wiped his place clean, in fact. I was also kind enough to let him taste Prawn ala Rooni the way I enjoy eating it. I skip the rice, and ask for the bread instead, dipping it in the delicious sauce and eating it along with the prawn. He actually enjoyed it more than his own meal! Anyone who orders the Prawn ala Rooni, I urge you to ask for the plain bread that\u0027s served in the bread basket, and have that instead of rice. I guarantee there will be an entirely different dimension of delicious flavors to your meal. We had wanted to round off our meal with the kiwi mousse, but unfortunately it wasn\u0027t part of the lunch menu. Which is fine, because now I have an excuse to drop in for dinner and have my dessert then :D","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-17T20:40:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-18T11:14:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"507728929","name":"Sarah Sherazee"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA3NzI4OTI5","before":"MTA3NjI4NTIxNQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"506941222690366","from":{"name":"Amna Saeed","id":"763004361"},"message":"Whats the budget per person?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-17T20:41:58+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"506941902690298","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Depends on what you order, but round about Rs. 2000 per head.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-17T20:44:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"507114012673087","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Nice one. \n\nWe sat on the deck yesterday since it was a Sunday and the construction next door had been stopped.
