Had a mix of banana, lychee, choco, tutti Frutti and strawberry.....my fave taro wasn\u0027t there.....but the lychee flavour saved the day...it was Delish..... Banana was a Lille Eire but the rest were excellent....\n\nAfter that we went to snog...... I refused to buy a cup there and settled on the testers.... Snog doesn\u0027t suit me...to each their own.....for me...it\u0027s gives me the feeling of the dhabba wali dhai.....and honestly I tried the choco one and it felt like dhai gone off sprinkled wid a miniscule amount of coco.....my apologies once again to the owners n it\u0027s supporters but.... froyo queen I am but this is one snog I won\u0027t be Puckering up my lips too!! \n\nAfter which we ended up at TUC.....and I had a plate of French fries to remove the snog after taste..... TUC...I don\u0027t need to taste...I have had it often enough to tell u blindly that their blackberry, raspberry and choco froyo is amazing. \n\nWe have saved Yo! For another day.....was looking forward to that as I have head good reviews....\n\nNow.....excuse me...while I go n brush my tongue to get the snog aftertaste out!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-16T18:44:33+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-17T10:07:13+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"611720320","name":"Quratulaien Tanveer"},{"id":"567197680","name":"Seema Mustafa"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"100000391823197","name":"Farah S.
