Started off with ordering jalapeno cheese balls as appetizers but sadly after ten minutes we were told they weren\u0027t available so ordered the shrimp cocktail appetizer instead (don\u0027t remember the exact name and I can\u0027t seem to find their menu online). Anyhow it was delicious, very tangy sauce to compliment the shrimps, loved it. We all ordered steaks for lunch and they were quite good. very huge serving sizes. I ordered the beef tenderloin steak with jalapeno sauce (half eaten in the pic) and it was quite good. Ordered mashed potatoes with it but they got a baked potato instead but anyhow the waiter replaced it without any hesitance. Moving on to the dessert, ordered a double chocolate sundae and bread pudding. The sundae was divineeee, couldn\u0027t get enough of it. However, I can\u0027t say the same for the bread pudding, it was just the most non appetizing pudding I\u0027ve ever had. Everything was wrong about it.\nAlso, the ambience was quite pleasant ...so I\u0027d rate the whole experience 8 out of 10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-19T15:33:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-19T18:49:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"716205426","name":"Hina Lakhany"},{"id":"100002154180249","name":"Afifa J Maniar"},{"id":"557355290","name":"Zaid Sheikh"},{"id":"602890081","name":"Farrah Faruqui"},{"id":"100004861441059","name":"Ifrah Hameed"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"100000545822658","name":"Adnan Hussain"},{"id":"100004024524064","name":"S M Uzair Raza"},{"id":"1134812784","name":"Amjad Siddiqui"},{"id":"732665092","name":"Mariam Bandukda"},{"id":"100006083859539","name":"Muhammad Amir"},{"id":"613589687","name":"Asim Pervez"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"100003317055814","name":"Suleman Khan"},{"id":"715730576","name":"Afshan Khan"},{"id":"100002759539286","name":"Sehar Mansoor"},{"id":"517470504","name":"Nida Ali"},{"id":"1669415344","name":"Emil Farooq"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"541805157","name":"Hira Jafrani"},{"id":"552135156","name":"M Ijlal Siddiqui"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"724148371","name":"Rabia Hai"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzI0MTQ4Mzcx","before":"NzE2MjA1NDI2"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_653913421326478/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNzI0MTQ4Mzcx"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"653945547989932","from":{"name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui","id":"532862764"},"message":"Ill add it in my list !

Dinner at Pantry over the weekend, and was surprised by the eclectic menu, quality of ingredients, and flavor of the meals served.\n\nOrdered the Gouda Burger, and after much hesitation, the Margherita Flat Bread.  The Gouda Burger was flavorful, and I was glad to finally find a good gourmet burger in the city.  \n\nThe Gouda accentuated the flavor of the tender, and juicy patty, while the condiments all complimented each other.  The Bun-Patty ratio was optimal, and the fresh texture of the bun made it all perfect.\n\nThe Margherita Flat Bread was exceptionally good.  The bread was baked well, and was topped with some good quality Margherita.  The flavor was light, and not overpowering -- enabling one to enjoy the flavor, without eating too much of bread.  Not exactly gourmet, but a perfect entree to munch on, during a casual dinner.\n\nPantry is a great addition to the dining scene in the city -- and one certainly hopes that quality remains impeccable.  Overall cost per head was PKR1500 (incl. drinks, meal, tips, etc.) -- which is a bit on the pricier end.\n\nHighly recommended for those looking for a not-so-usual menu, and flavorful food (at a price, though).\n\nOverall Rating -- 9/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-19T17:31:30+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-19T17:31:30+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"691430365","name":"Muhammad Ali Teli"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"1652751344","name":"Rameen Alvi"},{"id":"501776623","name":"Shayan Shabbir Lakdawalla"},{"id":"780560073","name":"Anita Zeeshan Al-Najjar"},{"id":"521961347","name":"Rabeet Ahsan"},{"id":"1137654497","name":"Maha Siddiqui"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5MjA0NTUy","before":"NjkxNDMwMzY1"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_653372798047207","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Cafeela gaajar ka halwa with malai...perfect","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-11-18T18:27:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-19T17:12:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100006717730226","name":"Cafeela Authorities"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"100003243160835","name":"Shahbaz Ahmed"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"100005370692630","name":"Muhammad Kamran"},{"id":"1637134436","name":"Haider Naqi"},{"id":"539261836","name":"Sid Raja"},{"id":"100004078952313","name":"Shazia Asghar"},{"id":"100006519972294","name":"Ali Raza Q"},{"id":"633982348","name":"Syed Ali Pasha"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"},{"id":"100007013108103","name":"Marium Khan"},{"id":"100000405676339","name":"Aisha Qayyum"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"100000696198876","name":"Zain Sheikh"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"635706999","name":"Syed Saad Pasha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjM1NzA2OTk5","before":"MTAwMDA2NzE3NzMwMjI2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"653374081380412","from":{"name":"Wasim Khan","id":"100001580114154"},"message":"The taste ?
