Well except maybe authentic chinese Bok choy with garlic! Anyhow I love China Kitchen. I went there initially when it opened and my friend (who loves Chinese) was swooning by the end of the meal. And I would agree the cuisine at China K is definitive of delectable. \nMoving on! Im not much of a sea food person either but I tried the Crab Rangoon the wontons were scrumptious and melted in my mouth. Will definitely have them again. Also tried the chicken lettuce wraps, the iceberg was crisp and the chicken melange was succulent. I wasn\u0027t as adventurous as to try the prawn on toast but since it was devoured I\u0027m sure it was pretty fantastic too.\nI also tried the duck for the very first time and to my surprise quite liked the meat. But since i\u0027m not an expert on duck meat cant say more :)\nKung Pao chicken at China K keeps getting better with every visit. The Orange chicken was zippy and full of flavor. Another favorite was the Singapore Noodles, a perfect, seasoned and light combination of veggies and noodles. The wasabi sauce on the Wasabi prawns was a little too sharp. And how can i forget the Crispy Beef? The sticky sauce is so tangy and rich - heavenly!\nIt was a perfect meal, everyone at the table enjoyed their food, the ambience was lovely and we were probably the loudest bunch in the restaurant. \n\nSpecial thank you to the hostess :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-04T21:48:47+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-06T08:12:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"100001432075867","name":"Suhaila Tobeh"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"738981577","name":"Sohail Maskatiya"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzM4OTgxNTc3","before":"Nzc3MjMzMDQy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"392586077459215","from":{"name":"Ahsan Rasheed","id":"199900911"},"message":"How were serving sizes?

Got to see the presentations, followed by the spheal of that lovely Chocolatier, the owner of Lals focused on Belgian Chocolate. I enjoyed the making\" your own dipping part of tasting, which sure tasted better then the any existing choc-bars of Walls. Not sure about it being Belgian, but tasted good. Let us see how it makes the business, the ice-cream at Rs.85/\u003d which does taste good but not much different, but is a good one dipped in crunch, and candies bits and several layers of melted chocolate that freezes beautifully sealing inside the crispy crunch and chocolate chip oooooh what luxury.
