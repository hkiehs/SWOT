We went as a large group around 7.30. The restaurant was empty at that time but during our stay the crowd kept pouring in. We had three servers managing our table and i should add the food was delicious however the service was dismal. \nThe servers had to be called multiple times to pick up the dirty dishes, requests for clean cutlery was ignored and there was a lot of confusion with the orders! It seemed that despite 3 people managing the table they could not somehow organize themselves. However the worst bit came in the end. A group of recent college graduates we were chirpy group but that does not mean we get accused for paying less! When we paid our bill the server who miscalculated the cash in his hand came to our table accusing us for paying less! One of my friends Hassaan AY politely asked him to recount the cash and it was discovered that he missed a 500rs note 400rs from which was his tip! It was weird being accused without reason! He should\u0027ve counted and recounted the cash before coming on our table and telling us we paid less! My sincere request to the owner to talk to his staff about such errors because though we enjoyed the food all we could talk about was the dismal way we were served...","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-20T08:21:04+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-21T05:00:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"567240021","name":"Marium Noman"},{"id":"541353397","name":"Nida Azwar"},{"id":"738235787","name":"Rimsha Siddique"},{"id":"1473431885","name":"Syed Aamir Bukhari"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQ3MzQzMTg4NQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NTY3MjQwMDIx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"382743765110113","from":{"name":"Rimsha Siddique","id":"738235787"},"message":"Just want to add another bit about the interior (ill) design of the false ceiling on the top floor where we were seated.

I had a similar experience at BBQ Tonight when I was managing an event for 110 people. However, the waiter there was courteous enough to request recounting in my presence as he felt the cash was less than the billed amount. Dealt in a courteous way, both parties realized that it was just a human error on his part. I believe such restaurants can safely assume that their customers will be respectable enough to not do such lowly stuff as paying less cash. Having said that, the fact that management says they will look into the matter speaks volumes of the importance they give to the customers.

It didn\u0027t have anything in excess (which I always take out)...the amount of mushrooms, baby corn, chicken, coconut milk, the consistency of the curry, the fact that it did not have an overdose of ANYTHING like the leaves or other thingys....I am SO happy its not even funny......The noodles...never had anything like that earlier so cannot really compare it to any place BUT it was again SUPERB AND JUST perfect, again no overdose of peanuts or veggies...just the way I love pasta!!!! Even the prawn tempuras were yummilicious...Thank you GD for yet another outstanding experience!

Surely enough five minutes later we were seated inside and quickly placed the order.  We ordered three types of Pizza\u0027s to start with  the margarita, pesto with anchovies, and the chicken and jalapeo.  Also for the starters we ordered the fried calamari with scallion and garlic plus the honey glazed wings.  Though the service was good on the whole I had to remind them three times in ten minutes to bring the water which was a tad bit irritating.  Apart from this little glitch service has vastly improved.The pizza\u0027s arrived promptlythe first the margarita was good but not great, the same with the second the chicken jalapeo it was good but not something which one would say hit the spot.  The third the pesto with anchovies I will be bold enough to say flavor wise was the best pizza I have eaten in Karachi period.  I say flavor wise because the toppings were a perfect \"10\" but the base in all three pizza\u0027s was a bit limp I prefer my base to be a bit crispy so not to droop in half when picked up from the plate.  That said if they can quickly fix this easily addressable problem they will definitely give the Pompei pizza a run for its money!!!  The fried calamari and the honey glazed wings arrived next.  Both were excellent !!! The garlic and scallions were perfectly balanced with the fried calamari as not to over power the taste and this dish was truly a pleasure to eat and the wings were also simply brilliant.  For mains we ordered the jalapeo cheese burger, the sliders, scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, and penne pasta with chicken and alfredo sauce.  I didn\u0027t have the scrambled eggs but my friend who did said they were excellent.  The jalapeo cheese burger was good but not as great as the sliders especially the blue cheese one..it was really super!!!  My daughter loved the penne pasta and said it is as good as any she has had  just as we had finished devouring are meal Sikander show up with a new dish he was sampling and asked if we would like to try it, we loved it but don\u0027t know if I should mention it as he is still working on it.
