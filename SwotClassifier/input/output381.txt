PATHETIC with a capital P. I did tag the damn location but it didn\u0027t appear here :( and neither did my cute emoticon :p\n\nKher. Firstly, it was the 10th iftar yesterday so there should not have been the problems that occurred yesterday, The menu was chicken in sticky red sauce, manchurian, fish tamarind, beef chilli gravy and vegetable rice. \n\nWe were the 1st ones to arrive...around 630ish. The place is tiny and cosy in the first look. The wall and ceiling look cool. Every and I mean EVERY single chinese place I have been to has the soya sauce, vinegar with chillies and red chilli sauce but not at Lantern. Anyways. the place was houseful by iftar time and even the tables outside were filled. We thought its a promising sign. \n\nIftar platters were placed with literally miskeen looking drumsticks. They had ZERO salt in them so all went back. The chicken meatball thingys were consumed by 1 of us, the other 4 didnt like the hardness and no-taste fact. The only saving grace were the fried wontons. Missed GD a lot at tht time. \n\nOh there was no TV, no announcement - nothing about the iftar time. AND no arrangement for prayers for ladies. The server had very conveniently informed us that u can go pray with the men in the garden and we were like  ----\u003e :o\n\nOk, then a server comes and takes our order of soup. Options: Hot n Sour Red and white. We ordered both. All I\u0027ll say about the soups is that usually the red chilli sauce and vinegar and soya sauce makes the worst of soups consumable. BUT not Lantern. Firstly the sauces came when the soups got cold...and they were the most bland and horrible tasting soups I have tasted. I mean places like Karachi Broast and Chips have served me with better tasting soups.\n\nWe asked the server can we eat coz it was 8 already. (There were 2 tables who were still asking for their soups at 8...poor souls). He said yes and when we reached, all the silver thingys were empty. 2 minutes later, the food (labelled on the silver lids) came but was incorrectly placed and a lot of food was spilled all over the table. I swear I felt like I was in some shadi hall at that time.\n\nNot too much of a fish person, I took the other 3 things. The Beef Chilli Gravy, like the soups were bland and utterly disappointing. The chicken in red sticky sauce had to be cut with steak knives. The sauce was just ok. Not worth the calories. The Manchurian was nice. Thank God, I could at least eat SOMETHING from the table. When I went for the second round, none of the dishes had meat in them and no one had bothered to check.\n\nThe operations manager had apologized for the mishaps saying today everything was going wrong. Well, after paying 970 per head, not even 1 of us wanted to give them any benefit of doubt. The comment card was photocopied with stuff doodled behind it. Gave them a very honest review and wished them the best of luck in the future as the 5 of us wont be going back at least. \n\nWORST IFTAR EXPERIENCE. \n\nOne day before iftar at Nandos was SUPERB. Pics and review following. I will just stick to my favorites next time for iftar that are at least worth it after 14+ hours of fasting.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T19:05:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589805244403963","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"when she said detailed review she was NOT kidding!!!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T19:09:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589805287737292","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"i will read this by Eid and get back","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T19:09:39+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589805711070583","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"I\u0027ll skip it probably.....too much detail.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T19:11:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589805954403892","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Sure Nez.

The honey chicken wings, and chicken wontons were delicious and so was the soup (cant recall name). Also ordered some potato croquette type appetizer which none of us liked, was to spicy. For the main course we ordered thai fried rice, beef chilli dry, kung pao chicken (my fav) and manchurian, all tasted yum, except the last which was a bit too sweet. The main course reached the table with a bit of a delay, but the overall experience was great!
