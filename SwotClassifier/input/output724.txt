This time everything was superb. Crunchy n crispy veg filling in the spring rolls though dint understand the purpose of the sauce served with it. Nothing more of a soy with diced chillies...the hot n soursoup,roast duck n noodle soup, crab n coriander, Tom yum n sweet corn were all served promptly n liked by all of us. The chicken in plum sauce, sweetness sour fish, honey chilli chicken, salmon, mixed vegetables stir fry, pad Thai noodles n shanghai beef noodles were all very nicely made. Lovely sauce n crisp fresh vegetables did all the justice. The rice I feel needs more flavour. Although the veg n egg fried rice served with the kids menu was far better. Oh yes!they have a kids menu which was an added pleasure n relief. My daughter loved the crispy chicken. Last the Mango pudding was the best ever I have had. It tasted of fresh sweet mango n very refreshing after the meal.

The wasabi prawns and mushroom buns were delicious !  The chicken satay was average and I didn\u0027t really like the peanut sauce. The shrimp dumplings are usually tricky but they were scrmptious ! The  duck , sesame honey chicken and beef teriyaki were so good that we had to order more. The service was a bit slow and the drinks especially the frozen fruit punch tasted awful, the lemon cooler wasn\u0027t anything to write home about either. We had baskin robbins for desert along with the chocolate buns which l thought were nice with a coconut and chocolate middle but the rest didn\u0027t quite like.

Disappointment #1. As a backup, we called Kolachi at 10pm, they said that if we wanted to reserve a table.. they expect us to go all the way to Phase 8 and get our name written which would result in us getting a table 1 hour AFTER the name was written. Disappointment # 2. So we went to Charcoal, and were HIGHLY disappointed. We ordered Hot \u0026 Sour soup and Mozarella sticks from the starters, Chicken Lasange, Ultimate Double Chicken, Jalapeno Burger, Chicken Peshawari, Tarragon Chicken and one more steak. EVERYTHING WAS SO BAD! Also, our food was cold. My brother got the Jalapeno Burger AFTER everyone was already done eating.
