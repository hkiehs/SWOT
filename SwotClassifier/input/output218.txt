Boxed I a simple cardboard box the cake was as modest as Bombay Bakery’s modest beginnings. It was very plainly decorated. I was expecting a fluffy moist cake but what I got was disappointment wrapped in a box. The cake was really dense and dry, but on the plus side it did not crumble. It hardly melted in my mouth and I had to chew through each bite. The coffee frosting was a bit better but it lacked the bitterness of the coffee that is supposed to cut through the sweetness. It was a bit too sweet for my taste. I’ll give it a 6/10. I don’t know what all the hype was about. There was nothing impressive about it, local bakeries make better cakes.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-06T14:15:51+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-08T15:41:51+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1385831564","name":"Mehvish Ayaz"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"827180267","name":"DrJoyo Tabsheer"},{"id":"100001772445260","name":"Zamzam Shah"},{"id":"517744955","name":"Haris Gala"},{"id":"584361907","name":"Maira Hasan"},{"id":"812005234","name":"Lubna Satar Choudary"},{"id":"720585459","name":"Aisha Abrar"},{"id":"571951019","name":"Muhammad Ahmad Azfar"},{"id":"517439826","name":"Muhammad Farhan"},{"id":"624683135","name":"Kashif Rehman"},{"id":"537012748","name":"Abdul Ahad Parekh"},{"id":"557540354","name":"Maliha Ehtram"},{"id":"588680855","name":"Tasneem Abbas"},{"id":"1834188826","name":"Mohammad ALi Khan"},{"id":"592929129","name":"Aqsa Jaliawala"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTkyOTI5MTI5","before":"MTM4NTgzMTU2NA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"614870125230808","from":{"name":"Aqsa Jaliawala","id":"592929129"},"message":"Bombay Bakery k cakes are never soft ..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-06T14:18:47+0000","like_count":10,"user_likes":false},{"id":"614871445230676","from":{"name":"Hassan Hayat Khan","id":"606730233"},"message":"My opinion may be biased as i am a loyal fan of The Bombay Bakers.
