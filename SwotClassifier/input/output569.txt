The food at Solen was in NO WAY unlike that street food found on the sloping pavements of Hudavandegar Cadessi in Sirkeci borough of Istanbul... There is NOTHING desi-fied About the food, all the flavours of sumac spice and paprika are apparent in the food, and what is thankfully missing is the nasty MSG-Dubba masala...\nThis is gr8 news as all I have to do is drive down to dolman mall to enjoy every thing from the succulent shawarma meats, the seasoned onions, tangy tomato sauce made with olive oil, and to contrast this w/ some yogurt, charred peppers, and of course lets not forget that sumac powder. I\u0027m only upset that it took me this long to visit and indulge my nostalgia for the cuisine of one of my favourite cities...","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-03-24T14:05:44+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-24T17:10:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"1360134242","name":"Fahima Mubashir"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAxNDE1NzE2","before":"MTAwMDAxODU4NDUwMDEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"526354564082365","from":{"name":"Faisal Naseer","id":"780902784"},"message":"I absolutely love Solen","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T14:30:56+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"526454027405752","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"it\u0027s damn good Turkish street food... so long as you stick to beef i presume... im SO glad to have waited and even MORE glad to not have listenned to other people...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T17:10:42+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI2NDU0MDI3NDA1NzUy","before":"NTI2MzU0NTY0MDgyMzY1"}}},"picture":"http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/482149_10151416382098743_414002375_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10151416382098743\u0026set\u003dpcb.526347237416431\u0026type\u003d1\u0026relevant_count\u003d5","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"},{"id":"165861103465048_526442280740260","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Ahmad","id":"536832784"},"message":"Zarnak Sidhwa\u0027s garlic dip \u0026 gooey choco brownies have been added to my list of all time favorites.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-24T16:38:31+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-24T16:39:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"510589585","name":"Omair Khan"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"1016847377","name":"Zartaj Mohmand"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"777488661","name":"Zarnak Sidhwa"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nzc3NDg4NjYx","before":"NTEwNTg5NTg1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"526442980740190","from":{"name":"Zarnak Sidhwa","id":"777488661"},"message":"thks !!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T16:39:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI2NDQyOTgwNzQwMTkw","before":"NTI2NDQyOTgwNzQwMTkw"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_526381967412958","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Just ordered from Rowtisserie.

Port Grand is such a blessing for us Karachiites! And I am so happy to see that they\u0027re maintaining the place well and the dining/ snacking options are increasing and improving. \nWe were there last Sunday to watch the match. Had a nice long stroll in the food street before settling in the match arena. Boba Tea and Twisty Crispy Fries kept the kids entertained (although I thought Twisty Crispy Fries were quite tasteless, soggy and overpriced), while Irfan Malik and I were tempted by the live cooking station of Thai Me Up. The Tom Yum Goong clear soup with prawns was amazingly pleasing to the senses of smell and taste, and the serving was whoppingly generous! Chicken in Oyster Sauce was also delicious although could\u0027ve done without the overload of onions in the sauce. Prawns in Red Curry on the other hand was delightfully fragrant and was packed with zest and richness. Overall, Thai Me Up is a great find. The only hitch is that since the food is made to order live in front of you, it takes a bit long... Long enough to make you miss a spectacular Afridi knock of 88 off 48! :( And therefore stressful enough to make you forget to click pictures before devouring it! :/ Anyways.. the place is a welcome addition. Oh and by the way, watching the match there was super-exciting with a very enthusiastic crowd, a live DJ covering the commercial breaks with Jazba Junoon, Josh-e-Junoon, and the likes, and of course, the Dhol walas. It was quite festive and I\u0027m sure tomorrow\u0027s match would be quite a treat too. :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-23T20:45:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-24T09:05:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"679913965","name":"Hina Dhanani"},{"id":"674095744","name":"Nadia Rauf"},{"id":"585612434","name":"Chaudhry Abbas"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"691451746","name":"Ayaz Sheikh"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"201004010","name":"Saiem Nasir"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"Njc5OTEzOTY1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"525928340791654","from":{"name":"Saira Malik","id":"1133719630"},"message":"Nezihe Hussain/ Snaps Har..
