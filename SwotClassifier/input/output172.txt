An ordinary one but less ordinary. more special in a way that it was filling.\n\nBacon Peperroni Jalapeno Pizza, 6/10 but upto the mark. maybe change the cheese topping. loved the crust though. fresh and crispy, this was a thin pan. \n\nTeriyaki Chicken, 5/10. big no from us. i think everyone just cannot do teriyaki. \n\nChicken Scallaponi, 8/10 this was my order. i dont remember much about this one, since i was busy tasting the others but i do remember that next time i goto monte cristo, i have to order one of these again.\n\nthe highlight of the night was the beef fillet, after such a long time, someone understood what medium rare is, and it was cooked to perfection. i was so happy to see it, that i forgot everything on the table. i found this to be so heavenly, i was almost envious why i did not order the fillet. Mushroom Sauce, impeccable. 9.5/10. perfectly seasoned, grilled, butter fried oh i want to have it right now !\n\nThanks Montecristo, i think we will become good friends. \n\nHaris Shaikh","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-25T06:30:55+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-26T11:26:29+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100006409002964","name":"Sirfraz Ali"},{"id":"530060365","name":"Abdul Wajid Qureshi"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"505552596","name":"Rabiya Anjum"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"558178102","name":"Safoora Fahad"},{"id":"569219957","name":"Naveed Ashraf"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"517470504","name":"Nida Ali"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"100003698171140","name":"Asra Mushtaq"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"642953122","name":"Amer Zahid"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"571357266","name":"Khurram Zameer"},{"id":"100001651622767","name":"Fatima Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNjUxNjIyNzY3","before":"MTAwMDA2NDA5MDAyOTY0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"624086504309170","from":{"name":"Umair Hassan","id":"755585401"},"message":"Fahad Farooq shayan ko dekha do yeh :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T07:36:50+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"577115473","name":"Fahad Farooq","type":"user","offset":0,"length":12}]},{"id":"624191927631961","from":{"name":"Sidra Khatri","id":"514359736"},"message":"lol we also went to Montecristo when we found Olivetto closed and recommended to many friends who also loved it... looks like Olivetto is giving away customers to Montecristo :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T13:32:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624214927629661","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"olivetto is closed on tuesdays","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T14:40:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624244844293336","from":{"name":"Anwer Jamal Chandna","id":"1424317236"},"message":"Haris Shaikh if you could pls name the items in the pictures for better understanding...though liked yr detailed review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T15:42:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624245077626646","from":{"name":"Haris Shaikh","id":"694723124"},"message":"Ok.

Located in a cozy and quiet neighborhood, rubbing shoulders with Hook Line and Sinker and overlooking the tomb of ghazi shah is this epitome of creativity and a culinary experience with something slapstick about it. You are greeted by a life size moustache which is the signature object of their branding strategy. \nThe décor has been done tastefully. From customized furniture, crockery and silverware to creatively done walls and walkways, SB definitely looks straight out of some intense brain storming session carried out by people with some exposure to the field of advertising. The menu is designed keeping in view the basic philosophy behind a dhaaba or a modern day café with entrees and appetizers named using street lingo for e.g the bhinnot bun kabab, besharam burger etc. You are welcomed by a group of young and old men and women who seem to be the managing partners as well. The regular servers can be spotted taking orders and running around but the fact that the people running the show are actually at your service is something not that frequently witnessed in this part of the world. The moment you step in you are attended by one of the managing partners who makes sure you are provided a seat at the earliest. We went on a Sunday evening when the café was packed to capacity but after a 10 minute waiting time we did manage to grab hold of a table. We ordered their famous bhinnot bun kabab, grilled chicken pizza and a bara gosht mushroom and beef burger. The bun kabab was not bad at all. It was served quite the dhaaba style wrapped in a page torn out of a telephone directory and chutni and ketchup as the dips.  The bun kabab was filling and crisped to perfection. However it was a bit bland which could have been worked on. The beef burger was quite good. Minced beef patty with the right temperature, coupled with mushrooms, white sauce and fresh veggies sandwiched in between a crispy pair of buns and with the right amount of sauces. Their pizza was served hot with just the right quantity of cheese, chicken cubes and veggies. For drinks we had the shikanjabeen which was quite rejuvenating and had a distinct spicy touch to it. Dinner was followed by dessert for which we ordered the Philadelphia cheese cake and chocolate walnut brownie served with vanilla ice cream. One of the managing partners was quite honest about the cake and gave us a forewarning regarding the sloppiness we might experience but it was quite the contrary. The cake was soft, fresh and adequately sweet. The walnut brownie was however the dessert of the night. Together with vanilla ice cream the brownie made a nice scintillating combo. \nAll in all, Sattar Buksh was a good experience amidst all the mixed reviews we had prior the visit. Their staff was attentive and the managing partners were, warmly welcoming and hospitable. The overall theme and the philosophy behind this modern day dhaaba has been brilliantly communicated with the help of their décor, furniture, messaged on their tissue boxes and humorous taglines and one liners. \n\nMy personal recommendations:\nBhinnot bun kabab, Bara gosht mushroom beef burger, Grilled chicken pizza, Walnut brownie with vanilla icecream and Philadelphia cheese cake\n\nWhat seems to be their USP? \n• A friendly and hospitable team of managing partners making you feel at home. \n• Slapstick feel to the whole place. \n• Creativity at its best. \n\nWhat do they need to work on? \n• Their servers need to be well versed in communicating the contents of the food being ordered. They should know the menu inside out. \n• Accessible phone numbers for prior reservations will be really helpful.\n• The quality of food needs further improvement.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-26T06:50:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-26T08:37:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"695341673","name":"Syeda Abmreen Saira"},{"id":"761278691","name":"Abdullah Soomro"},{"id":"508947500","name":"Cyra Baria"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"851800404","name":"Aamna Mansoor Badshah"},{"id":"1203190290","name":"Tayyab Tanvir Bhatti"},{"id":"513648490","name":"Fatima Javed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEzNjQ4NDkw","before":"Njk1MzQxNjcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"624578950926592","from":{"name":"Amad Ul Hasan Siddiqui","id":"538934895"},"message":"I am not sure about Sattar Buksh but the review gets full points (Y)..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-26T08:37:31+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI0NTc4OTUwOTI2NTky","before":"NjI0NTc4OTUwOTI2NTky"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_623669631017524","from":{"name":"Haris Hassan","id":"673567501"},"message":"Folks, \u0027Koel cafe\u0027 or \u0027The patio\u0027?

It\u0027s a little bit nuts how much I like it. If you ever visit, you must try their moroccan chicken and chicken with spinach sauce - divine and great pricing too! One night I was craving something from their fabulous kitchen so I placed an order for a Prawn Fettucine Pasta and Chicken Wrap for my mother. I was utterly heartbroken to receive what I did - pasta with no white sauce, instead it was doused in oil. I would have still eaten it without the white sauce but it was impossible to consume with all that oil. My mother\u0027s wrap was ridiculously small, it was embarrassing because I\u0027d blindly promoted everything - What could be wrong in the eyes of a fan, right? To top it off, they had put GST charges on\nthe bill. This is where my knowledge might lack a bit, but is that a common practice? Shouldn\u0027t they inform the customer when he\u0027s ordering? I complained about this to them when I received the bill and they said they would check and get back to me and I never got a call.
