This new kid on the block needs lot of time to reach the required level. The area is not really ideal for sitting outdoors so opted for sitting in the car, no proper lighting and seating as it was too sandy. The order was taken promptly but it took twenty minutes to serve it. Fish and Chips was thin and the fish was bland and lacked body, seemed like frozen fillet\u0027s fried and served instead of fresh fish, no tarter sauce only chatni. Malai Fish Tikka was good served on four skewers and Fish fillet grilled was ok, thin slice of fillet, masala was more on the surface and didn\u0027t sink in. We asked what happened to the bread rolls but they didn\u0027t have them so a guy was seen rushing on his motorbike to fetch them and even the ones he managed to get were not fresh, lemon provided was like rock and needed a ton of pressure to yield a few drops. Met the owner a young man who ably dealt with a situation that happened their with some people who should not have been their in the first place, anyways value for money its 5/10,quality of food its 6/10, service is slack and no one asked us after we were served if we required anything. They need to work hard and diversify their menu, no rice, only 38 items on their menu. A lot needs to be done to improve by leaps and bounds starting with the whole ambience of the place.Prices versus value for money, were not competitive. I hope this critique is taken positively and helps the place to improve as a lot is lacking and can be improved upon considering that the location is fantastic with Village on one side and Cineplex right behind, this can yield benefits if measures are taken for improvement.Goodluck!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-01T22:27:39+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-02T14:48:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"726690443","name":"Danial Rizvi"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1473681227","name":"Shabnam Jabbar"},{"id":"100001822097920","name":"Sara Kazmi"},{"id":"543405800","name":"Tahir Wahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNDA1ODAw","before":"MTAwMDAyOTY3NTA0MTU5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"371123056272184","from":{"name":"Saira Qadri","id":"609681937"},"message":"rock and needed a ton of pressure to yield a few drops.......lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-02T10:43:02+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"371184869599336","from":{"name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi","id":"1198831376"},"message":"Lol ....

Loved the food. Especially my mom enjoyed her grilled chicken with mushroom sauce. I had the blue ginger salad and loved the blue cheese and dressing. Also, they were nice enough to substitute smoked veal for chicken. Also, i tasted my mothers entree and the chicken along with the mushroom sauce was yummy..","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-02T10:04:16+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-02T11:56:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"1463201564","name":"ArtScene Galleries"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"},{"id":"643405172","name":"Sarah Ashraf"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"513648490","name":"Fatima Javed"},{"id":"585155431","name":"Atiqa Ali"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjY4OTYxNDAz","before":"ODM0MjcwMDY0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"371110482940108","from":{"name":"Saeeda Rizvi","id":"100002668961403"},"message":"i went with my mom a few weeks back and she ordered the same entree and really enjoyed it :)\n i love the spinach and spaghetti they serve with the chicken!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-02T10:11:19+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"371127429605080","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Ammara Haque - Thank you!!
