Laziest and the most unprofessional service one can imagine!\n\nCalled to ask if order (Biryani Centre) can be placed via phone. The operator said that due to a large number of orders, it is not possible to take orders via phone. Please order through the website or app.\n\nNext thing - order placed on the website within 5 minutes, at 6.12pm. Called myself just to confirm if they had received it and expected delivery time etc. Four attempts, call drops each time it gets to the operator. \n\nAnnoyed. Called Indus Foods directly and placed the order. Called foodpanda again to cancel the order. Three more attempts but still can\u0027t get through. Indus Foods order arrives within 30 mins. All is well with the countdown to iftar until...\n\n7.09pm - SMS, email and call - all received simultaneously from foodpanda! The operator started with \u0027I\u0027d like to confirm your order. Your order will be delivered within 50 minutes\u0027. When I told him to cancel the order due to super late response, the operator dares to go ahead with his FIRST LIE: \u0027Due to the long order queue, confirmation calls are SLIGHTLY late\u0027. Hmm... 60 minutes late - are they that understaffed? Nah! They must be getting a zillion orders by the minute. Good for the pandas.\n\nAsked him to cancel the order but he wouldn\u0027t budge. Told him 60 mins of no response (plus 50 mins delivery time starting from this minute) is not acceptable. Even if I confirm now, it\u0027ll take the order minimum 15 mins to get here, wont it? Then the operator dares to lie for the second time: \"Your order was being processed. It will be there any moment. Let me coordinate with Biryani Centre, the rider might just be outside your gate even.\"\nSo now orders are being delivered without any confirmation? Interesting.\n\nWhen I questioned him on how he had initially called to confirm and then said the rider might be at my gate (in which case calling was futile anyway), the operator continued to digress or argue. Told him he\u0027s welcome to \u0027confirm and forward\u0027 the order to Biryani Centre but, if and when it arrives, it won\u0027t be collected or paid for since he\u0027s flatly refusing to cancel the order.\n\nWhile I\u0027d like to believe the refusal thing worked in getting the order cancelled, I hope a Biryani Centre rider does not show up at my gate any time now. After all, its been only 2 hours since they called. One never knows, due to their \u0027order queue\u0027, they may well (forcefully) deliver after 6-8 hours.\n\nPoor service is one thing. Lies on top of lies to refuse mistakes are an altogether different thing. Wishing the pandas all the best with their zillion orders.

The concept is novel, providing a diverse menu, better service, and relatively premium items, compared to the standard quetta hotels/dhabba.\n\nTried the Masala Chai.  Well, it was just chai, nothing really special about it -- and neither does the taste justify the price premium.  Similarly, there are other better options for Saada Chai as well.  The tea menu is interesting, and it will be great if the management (which I think is on these food groups) provides a description of the teas on the menu as well.\n\nThe menu also had various derivatives of the paratha, and we tried the Pizza paratha, Cheese paratha, and Nutella paratha. The parathas overall lacked the layers, and the flakiness associated with parathas served at these dhabas, and isn\u0027t really something I\u0027d like to try again, given other better options.  The pizza paratha was basically \u0027anda on a paratha\u0027 which one can have from pretty much any other dhaba.  The Cheese paratha just had a bit of Mozarella on top, which wasn\u0027t really complementing the taste of the paratha.  Finally, Nutella paratha tasted good -- BUT its NUTELLA, it is supposed to taste GOOD with EVERYTHING.\n\nOverall, the service was great, but the flavor leaves a lot to be desired.  Will I be ditching Quetta Alamgir, Chai Dhaba, the hotel on the corner of HotSpot, or Quetta Sufyan for this.  I really doubt that.\n\nThe concept is Amazing.  Tweaking the flavor a bit, and the parathas can do wonders for this place (which already is doing really well).\n\nOverall score: 6/10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-07T00:47:09+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-07T04:33:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"619015976","name":"Marium Zubair"},{"id":"504392072","name":"Ali Ahmad"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"501776623","name":"Shayan Shabbir Lakdawalla"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAxNzc2NjIz","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc0MDgxMjMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"599619346755886","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"good review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-07T04:33:31+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTk5NjE5MzQ2NzU1ODg2","before":"NTk5NjE5MzQ2NzU1ODg2"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_599172873467200","from":{"name":"Kiran Majid","id":"516120343"},"message":"Where would i find yummy bun kabab in PECHS area?
