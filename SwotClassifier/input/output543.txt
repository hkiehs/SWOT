Being on a low cal and healthy and  green lifestyle it is not easy to eat out.  \n\nKoel’s menu did not disappoint at all, had many fresh vegetable and low fat and low cal choices. I ordered courtyard salad (350), a plate full of rocket, lettuce and tomatoes with olives and feta topped with olive oil and herb dressing.  Totally fresh packed with all the micronutrient and phytochemicals. Main course it was an awesome baked vegetable stack  (235) that was thick slices of bringal, tomatoes layered with mashed  cheese and vegetable  and herbs, no oil or spices, palatable and filling. To wash it all down i wanted my old time fav tamarind cooler (150) but no added sugar, so a mildly salted version is served topped with toasted crunchy cumin (zebra).\n\n I found the prices, quality and quantity or the dishes very reasonable. For a lunch of 3, we paid 1875/\u003d (20% discount for Standard Chartered Card). The ambience was calming and the service good, nothing to complain about. Koel I will be visiting you more often now.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-19T11:21:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-19T14:44:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"766095724","name":"Kashif Malim"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"542306225","name":"Faizan Karsaz"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNDU2MDU5MDk1","before":"NzY2MDk1NzI0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"543281082389713","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Welcome back to SWOT FSK.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T11:26:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543281885722966","from":{"name":"Farah S.
