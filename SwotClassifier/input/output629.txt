Let\u0027s just say that I was in food heaven when I finally got back home, and was thus unable to land back down to Earth long enough to compose and post a review. It was a small group, and since Okra is a small place, we were well-suited. Saira, AC, Rye\u0027aan and I set out on an Okra binge, and man, did we binge! I had already stuffed up on the brilliant breads with the chili oil, butter and balsamic vinegar in olive oil. For appetizers, we ordered the carpaccio, which has to be the thinnest, most flavorful meat I have ever had. AC insisted we try the mussels, which was a first for me, and it won\u0027t be the last, that\u0027s for sure! The mezze platter, let\u0027s just say, caught my attention. I don\u0027t know what everything was on there, and I was too busy eating to ask. I\u0027m pretty sure I had the stuffed grape leaves, which was different and delightful to eat. But then again, everything there was different and delightful to eat.\n For mains, everyone else ordered beef, and I asked for the lamb shank with saffron risotto. I haven\u0027t found a risotto like that anywhere in Karachi. Soft, creamy, and actual arborio rice! The short grain, starchy stuff which actually makes a proper risotto! The gravy served with it was the way it\u0027s supposed to be. Not too thick, a reduction of concentrated flavors which teased the taste buds rather than full on flavor of salanish, cornfloured-to-death gravy. The shank itself was soft, falling-off-the-bone buttery meat. The flavor of the meat shone through brilliantly, and the strong, meaty taste of lamb which often prevents me from even going near lamb meat was barely present! That\u0027s one place I won\u0027t mind ordering lamb again. Everyone else\u0027s mains looked amazing, specially the vegetables. Blanched properly, retaining their color, vibrant, healthy looking and not soggy or dripping butter or oil. Brilliant. \nThe desserts we ordered were creme brulee, chocolate tart with pink peppercorn ice cream, and crepes suzette. I didn\u0027t try the crepes, but the creme brulee was the star of the show. The sugar was caramelized to perfection, and the velvety smooth dreaminess underneath was a beautiful contrast to the crispy burnt sugar on top. The tart was a bit of a letdown, too dense and oily, although I couldn\u0027t find any fault with the pastry, which was crisp and yummy. The pink peppercorn ice cream was interesting, something I\u0027d like to try again. The actual heat came through when one took a bit of the pink peppercorns sprinkled on top, otherwise there was a mild, barely discernable heat resonating through the ice cream, which lasted the first 3 bites, but lost its kick as I ate more of it. \nAll in all, it was a wonderful evening, with lovely food and even lovelier people. Yes, AC included, no matter how much he acts up on the page, he is a delight to have as a meal companion. His hits don\u0027t stop, but his facial expressions and intonations help lessening the blows :p I think I was one of the rare people who haven\u0027t been to Okra as yet, but not anymooorreee :D","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-08T13:05:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-08T13:05:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"602358073","name":"Saad Ahmed"},{"id":"575486349","name":"Amber Rizvi"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"530485619","name":"Hana Faisal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTMwNDg1NjE5","before":"NjAyMzU4MDcz"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_502454216472400","from":{"name":"Mahvash Siddiqi","id":"724851212"},"message":"A lot of reviews have already been posted for the \u0027Lantern\u0027.

The meat for the galore of dishes ordered was cooked perfectly, though I felt that a lot of the dishes had been overpowered by oyster sauce \u0026 hence tasted the same.   The dessert of candied fruit was yummy. The lantern has just opened up by people new to this business. They have a long way to go, but I think they\u0027re going in the right direction.
