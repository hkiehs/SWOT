Ordered Garlic mayo fries and American Chop suey. Great food.. Huge portions. One is good enough for four people to the least. The ambiance is really nice, the music is lovely.. But all I want to rave about is their chocolate mousse.. It is truly by far the BEST chocolate mousse I have ever had! literally lip-smacking.. We could not get enough of it.. Tahir Wahid sent it to us as a complimentary dessert, just as we were about to leave. Thank you Tahir! We both loved it!! You have opened up the pandora\u0027s box..
