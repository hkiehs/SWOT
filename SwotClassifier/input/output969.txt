China Kitchen.............. Here is the low down. I took the set menu (thank god for simplicity) Started with Hot and Sour soup, Wonderful smoky taste, adorned with Tofu, ginger and Shitake mushrooms. Brilliant, as good as any soup in a decent New York restaurant. Then came the wontons, crisp with a plum sauce.The most amazing dish was the fried squid, covered with sechuan pepper, tiny diced chillies was pure heaven. Moist, flavourful, balanced with shrimp. Awesome. Then the crispy beef in a noodle nest. Once again the tang of orange peel, the sweetness the crisp crunch. Then came the mind blowers. The black pepper beef, was moist tender chunks of beef, delicate, juicy and tender, like top sirloin. Spotted Ayaz of Okra  dining next to us. The tender chunks of chicken in a tangy sesame sauce.  The Sechuan fish was awesome. I do not praise restaurants much, usually I am underwhelmed. BUT.... China Kitchen has done something that few will appreciate, they have REDEFINED the ketchupy food we have come to expect from Chinese restaurants. The food, the service was Awesome.... I hereby award my RED HAT for the best upcoming ground breaking Chinese Restaraunt. The food was divine, except the fried rice.

I\u0027m sure most of the members here are familiar with the term, “crabbing” and know that in karachi it (crabbing) revolves around, not the act of fishing for crabs in the sea, but just feasting on them. Captain Saleem, the man, or should I say his \"venture\", needs no introduction (because now it’s more like a pvt. Ltd company; he should seriously consider registering it at the kse), was our “Kaptaan”. To cut to the chase, he did a fantastic job last night. The chutney was phenomenal. His team never fails to impress me. Every time I\u0027ve opted for another kaptaan, I have been disappointed…to the point where I have been reprimanded by my friends for making the evening uncomfortable by going on and on about how captain saleems food tastes SO much better than his rivals. The point is, don\u0027t waste your evening in another kaptaans boat if you want to enjoy the real crabbing experience, saleem will never disappoint you and will never fail to surprise you with new crab-concoctions each time you hire him. Ask Saleem to serve boiled claws. I tried them for the first time last night. They were delicious. I still love my masala ones but this was a pleasant change.
