So I ordered the Spicy Ladies and Burger From Hell through Urbanite (Love, love, love). Within 5 minutes of placing my order, the rain and wind started. A while later, I was pleasantly surprised to see a Facebook inbox from Najam sb, showing his concern for my order and letting me know that the food had been packed and ready for twenty minutes before it was picked up by the rider. Having lived in Karachi all my life, I understood of course. I also felt guilty for sending a poor man out on a motorcycle to deliver food in such a heavy downpour, and assured Najam sb not to worry. So thank you, Najam sb.

How shameful it is to serve such quality of food. Aren’t they supposed to check the meal before they serve? I’m sorry but I dnt think, I will ever go to that branch again.
