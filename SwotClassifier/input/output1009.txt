Ordered from BOT last night and was very dissapointed with the experience. I was told delivery would take an hour which was late by any standards, but at least you can say one was informed. However despite five follw up calls the foood did not arrive till an hour and a half later, which is way too long to wait for dinner espacilaly with a diabetic person waiting.  when he came the rider informed us that he was the only rider and hence the dealy. if we advertsie to such extents i think ncessary resources should be deployed. Due to the delay, the food was cold and unimpressive. Was particularly disspaointed with the fish biryani, which was fish on top of regular birnai as opposed to a proper fish layered biryani. the lady answering the phone seeemd to have no clue as to the whereabouts of the rider and despite promising to locate him and call me back (the fourth time i called) i never recived a call back. I had already fried omeltte and defrosted frozed food by the time the food came, which also resulted in wastage. if we are delaing with the cosumner market we need to be mindful of these consequences that cosumers have to face due to bad service.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-12T07:34:16+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-12T18:10:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000578236531","name":"Naheed Asim"},{"id":"10403487","name":"Mehreen Obaid"},{"id":"666695402","name":"Marium Ejaz Karimi"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"688336352","name":"Abbas Farid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg4MzM2MzUy","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc4MjM2NTMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"276316139086210","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi, an unsatisfied customer.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T07:54:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":19}]},{"id":"276320659085758","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"one of the rare unsatisfied customers of BOTS","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T08:07:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276321659085658","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"their delivery problems is one of their only ones. first of all grilled sea food can not travel - even the 20mins it takes to anyone\u0027s house. lets be fair. the fact it takes a long time to serve is also faced by people sitting there to order - coz certain items have to be de-frosted and that takes time.\n\nas far as biryani goes - i have not had the fish one so cant comment but LOVE the prawn one.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T08:12:42+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276322189085605","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"Prawn Biryani is the trademark of BOTS.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T08:15:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276322875752203","from":{"name":"Najam Malik","id":"610590030"},"message":"its best if eaten then and there. takeaway not recommended!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T08:18:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276323925752098","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Nadiya...thanks for sharing.
