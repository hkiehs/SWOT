Wonderful food! Service was a bit slow and there were a few mess ups with the food ordered, but that is understandable seeing as it\u0027s Eid and they were probably short on staff :)\nFor starters we ordered a Tomato and Olives Bruschetta. We ordered one, but they gave us two orders :p well, that doesn\u0027t matter because we quite enjoyed the starter as it was quite lovely. The soup was ordered was Tomato Soup. It was absolutely divine and creamy and just plain yumm.\nThe main courses were Grilled Chicken with Tarragon Sauce, Grilled Chicken with Mushroom Risotto and Spicy Japanese Chicken. My own main was the Tarragon Chicken and I loved it. Though I do wish there was a little more tarragon sauce. Either way, the chicken was cooked to perfection, the sauce delicious, as were the accompanying sautéed veggies and mashed potatoes. My mom\u0027s main was the chicken with mushroom risotto and she loved her dish, as did I. I love mushrooms and i love risotto and I\u0027ve found that not many restaurants can put the two together and make it taste divine, by Olivetto and Gon Pacci really do make a really tasty mushroom risotto. I didn\u0027t get to try more than a bite of the Spicy Japanese Chicken, that too at the very end, but what I tasted was quite lovely and perfectly spiced.\nOur drinks were a Hazelnut Frappe and an Affogato. Both were perfectly sweet, cold and refreshing, as they were meant to be. All in all, a wonderful fine dining experience! Thank you Gon Pacci for a lovely night :D","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-10T19:39:09+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-10T20:16:25+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"698764443","name":"Shahnawaz Moti"},{"id":"504513463","name":"Fariha A Farooqui"},{"id":"100000087541003","name":"Sarah Iftikhar"},{"id":"813405111","name":"Moiz Ali P"},{"id":"100001132050300","name":"Noor Un Nisa Daudpota"},{"id":"1103653032","name":"Maha Raheel"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEwMzY1MzAzMg\u003d\u003d","before":"NTc1Mjc2NzUy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"601283709922783","from":{"name":"Marvi Shah","id":"522705412"},"message":"Oh and one more thing.

Any ways after being turned down from Yogen Fruz we went ot Del Frio which was a mixed experience. We ordered Belgian cocolate ice cream, Apple crumble, cold coffee and one more thing that i dont recall which we were told was not available after 30 min. the rest of the orders were served quiet late around 30 min. The Belgian chocolate ice cream was looking more like a soup. the Apple crumble was good though. The AC wasn\u0027t working and it was quiet hot inside. When we told about the melted ice cream, they were courteous enough to offer a complementary scoop of straw berry ice cream which was to our surprise frozen! The staff was apologetic for the inconvenience though this could have been avoided if they are well prepared for the customers before hand.

Malt cake and chocolate fudge brownie were yummy. Overall not bad. The only hitch was the ambience. Seating needs a redo. We were a big group of 8 so they joined 2 tables which were not balanced.

Downsides: for people like me even the double burger wasn\u0027t enough, don\u0027t know what\u0027s happened to their burger sizes it seems yet are catering the catwalk circle, so if you like eating buy yourself at least two burgers, the other issue is the pet bottle served with the meal, for crying out loud at least give us a can when we order a Rs. 480 meal","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-10T09:17:08+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-10T14:25:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"520882045","name":"Ghulam Ali"},{"id":"100004993633855","name":"Mahzareen Mama"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"509686069","name":"Hasaan Mubasher Sheikh"},{"id":"737997112","name":"Jehanzeb Aftab"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"548806223","name":"Sheikh Arsalan Saeed"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"593385155","name":"Mubashir Zuberi"},{"id":"515079700","name":"Ammar Ahmed"},{"id":"614180346","name":"Ahmad Zafar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE0MTgwMzQ2","before":"NTIwODgyMDQ1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"601084336609387","from":{"name":"Mohammad Tapal","id":"573800671"},"message":"Same here..tastes great but one double burger is just not enough.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T09:23:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601109979940156","from":{"name":"Nadeem Roomi","id":"526053686"},"message":"Still it\u0027s the cheapest burgers in town.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T11:11:12+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601177836600037","from":{"name":"Asim Nawab","id":"780112866"},"message":"what fries are they serving ? crinkle or thick fries ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T14:18:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601179609933193","from":{"name":"Ali Saeed","id":"100001081337199"},"message":"Crinkle","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T14:25:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAxMTc5NjA5OTMzMTkz","before":"NjAxMDg0MzM2NjA5Mzg3"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_601166766601144","from":{"name":"Altan Ahmed","id":"514224246"},"message":"Need number for California pizza and suggestions","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-10T13:42:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-10T13:59:29+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"601171589933995","from":{"name":"Ali Khoja","id":"658190120"},"message":"(021) 34928158\n0302 8287171\nCheese Lover \u0026 Creamy tikka are must try !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T13:56:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601172606600560","from":{"name":"Altan Ahmed","id":"514224246"},"message":"Thank you, will definitely order them....!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T13:59:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAxMTcyNjA2NjAwNTYw","before":"NjAxMTcxNTg5OTMzOTk1"}}}}]}
