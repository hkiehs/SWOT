The children fell in love with the place instantly. Activities are really great. Very courteous staff. The only low thing was a limited menu. Wish they add few more items like chicken drumettes or Mini Burgers for children. Also the menu for older lot has just two main items, Cheesy Pasta \u0026 Pizza. They should have a lil bit more variety like club sandwich etc on the menu. Overall a good experience.

Golden Dragon - My new love for Thai and Chinese food. Hot favourites: American Chopsuey, Crispy Beef, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Hot and Sour Soup, Thai Soup, Thai Green Curry, Wontons, Zingers and Chicken Karhai (the last two from their Lunch Xpress section)\n\n2. Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb\u0027s warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I\u0027m not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away. Will go soon to be blown away by other things too.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-25T18:59:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-27T14:47:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"505164013","name":"Yasmeen Agad-Kothawala"},{"id":"515396294","name":"Danish Ali Dahraj"},{"id":"100003249618202","name":"Heer Ahmed"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"500907007","name":"Murtaza Moiz"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNjUxNzIy","before":"NjU3MDMxNzQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"404073356310487","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"i see myself featured here too, obliged and humbled Hajra Amir","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T19:33:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir","type":"user","offset":52,"length":10}]},{"id":"404123489638807","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Thank you Hajra :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T21:13:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra","type":"user","offset":10,"length":5}]},{"id":"404386042945885","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"These places are on my fingertips 24/7!!!
