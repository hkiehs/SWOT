for my liking. and i only judge a place by its vanilla since im not fond of chocolate in any form other than itself. \n\ncookie dough was good. also synthetic but far less and therefore too sweet for me.\n\ncoffee brownie was goooooooodddd. had a lovely flavour of well roasted coffee. 150 for 1 scoop. the scoop, though, was half the cup, not a full cup. as in think of a ying-yang from top. that was a mild peeve. but the flavour and texture were lovely.\n\ndidnt try anything else cuz that would be much too much sugar to burn over 1 week. the stuff looked good. prices 180 and upwards for slices of cake/ brownies/ cupcakes. since i dont have much of a sweet tooth: would love to hear feedback from others. \n\nnow i dont know what authentic gelato is supposed to be like so i cant judge that. but. it was good.\n\nthe ambience: very cafe-in-NY or other western urban centre. lovely music. decor. for a while after the burst of roasted coffee flavour in my mouth i did feel i was back in

I\u0027ve heard a few people take issue with the scooping method and we\u0027re really thinking about switching to the rounded scoops instead of the italian spatula for this reason, so stay tuned on that front. As for the taste of the gelato, we use nothing synthetic i assure you, all the ingredients we use are real and fresh. Our cookie dough flavour called Chocochipper, is made with real chocolate chip cookies that we make in house, the same you can buy. The vanilla is a madagascar vanilla and while I can understand if you didn\u0027t love it, rest assured it\u0027s not synthetic. I\u0027m so glad you love the coffee brownie, it was one that I decided should go in the menu and is again made using Lavazza 100% arabbica coffee and Lal american brownies.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-11T16:59:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"458980837486405","from":{"name":"Madiha Sultan Tai","id":"24440"},"message":"For next time, please do try the pistachio, which is made with real pistachios, the mint choco flake as well as the kinder which might appeal to you if you love vanilla-ish stuff.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-11T17:00:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"458983530819469","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"Thank you so much Madiha.
