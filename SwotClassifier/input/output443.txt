For months I had heard great reviews of the kind of treats that came out of the kitchen of Fatso’s; being a big supporter of startups as well as sucker for desserts, I decided to give Fatsos a try. I was also constantly being told that the owner of this sensational catering company; was an alum of Le cordon bleu, and hence, she was fully versed in her ingredients and baking skills. So one fine day I finally went on the Fatso’s facebook page and went through the menu list. The one dessert that caught my eye was the Mango, Dark Chocolate \u0026 Cinnamon Cake with Mango whipped cream and Bourbon Vanilla bean.(I’ll be honest the Bourbon Vanilla impressed this jutt) The picture that was posted was a beautiful designed Mango cake that had mango pieces cut to perfection and placed-oh so gently on top of the cake. The picture alone made my mouth salivate, and without another thought I messaged the owner of Fatso’s. When asking the owner how much the cake would cost she said Rs.3000. A little hesitant I became from the price-but then as a true foody (self proclaimed) I understood that I was paying for the expensive ingredients and a 360 degree experience on my pallet. So there was nothing left for me to do, and so I placed my order for an Rs.3000 Mango cake. A few days later I had to pick up my order, unfortunately, I was stuck at work and made the mistake of telling my fiancée to pick it up instead. When he asked me how much he had to pay Fatso’s, I told him the price, and for that, he very calmly stated that all my financial decisions makings after marriage would be revoked, as we do not own oil fields.(just a reminder in case i hadn’t gotten the memo). I told him the return of investment would be worth every penny, and that he was too cheap to understand that the cake was being crafted by a true pastry artisan.  \nThe next day I had gone over to my fiancées with my sister to have cake and chai. My first reaction when I saw the cake was an underwhelmed one- just by the presentation, the cake was like any ordinary round cake with yellow frosting. The topping of the mangos were not cut beautifully as the picture, instead, the mango was cut in long strips and looked like mango worms, an extremely careless job and def not of a professional. Yet, my optimistic self said let’s not judge the book by its cover. So now it was time to try the Rs.3000 investment…the experience… forgettable (even for this jutt). There was no sign of cinnamon or bourbon vanilla bean taste, the frosting tasted like kaybees mango ice cream but in the form of frosting. The chocolate cake I must admit was nice and moist and definitely had a good chocolate flavor (but so does Betty Crocker chocolate cake mix for the price of Rs.350). The 360 degrees experience was limited to a mere 65 degrees. By the end of cake tasting I willing gave up my rights of my financial decision making…(a little experience note)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-29T07:36:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-29T14:10:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"607771212","name":"Maira Ahsan"},{"id":"514292991","name":"Marium Hosein"},{"id":"521420389","name":"Syed Jami Amin"},{"id":"786471893","name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed"},{"id":"675866757","name":"Vijanti Perwani"},{"id":"1807053822","name":"Sahrish Naseer"},{"id":"857175366","name":"Usama Qureshi"},{"id":"1088748635","name":"Aqsa Shah"},{"id":"539145384","name":"Saher Shaikh"},{"id":"504398246","name":"Uzma Arij Bilgrami"},{"id":"504654956","name":"Hiba Ali Raza"},{"id":"546160156","name":"Kahkashan Hassan"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"503086792","name":"Mehreen Rohan Shoaib"},{"id":"515193342","name":"Mesam Akhter"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.
