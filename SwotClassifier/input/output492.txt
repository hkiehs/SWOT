I would recommend the sweeter flavors than the tart one\u0027s, but to each its own. \nAs it opens to the public tomorrow, I would suggest giving it a try, if you\u0027re into strong flavors then you must try the espresso, as it wasn\u0027t just the \u0027coffee\u0027 flavor other franchises offer, it almost felt as a real espresso shot! Also if you\u0027re into exotic flavors then Peanut butter should be your best bet. \nAnother really cool new addition at the Yogen fruz was the mix in corner, we now apparently have the option of mixing up flavors to make a fro-yo of your choice, plus they had a huge sprawl of berries and fruits.

(Do keep in mind that we were the only patrons in the restaurant till we left) on inquiring the dish was bought over to our table and once we took a bite the tempura were cold! We did not make a fuss about it and finished what was there and ordered another round of the same dish while informing the waiter to please make sure they are served to us the minute the food is ready, alongside we also ordered the 15 piece Sashimi platter. The Salmon was frozen not cold I repeat it was frozen! I called for the floor manager and he had no clue and his only response was that we are short on fish and this was taken out of the freezer. After the Sashimi fiasco we just paid for what we had consumed and left. On a side note we also ordered a bottle of Perrier, the menu says it’s a litter bottle for PKR 375 however the bottle that was served was 750 ml. they should fix their menu to what they are serving.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-27T12:42:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-28T12:37:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1642400541","name":"Fatima Kashif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTY0MjQwMDU0MQ\u003d\u003d","before":"MTY0MjQwMDU0MQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"562851837099304","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"WOW!

I was there for the 4pm show yesterday (iron man 3 3D). firstly they had they were out of nachos or had not started serving them as yet so they were unavailable , I ordered Mountain dew with caramel popcorn. the Drink was a mixture of everything (pepsi, miranda, Dew) so it tasted horrible and the popcorn were not up to the mark. \n\nwe went in and got seated getting the 3D glasses on the way , it turned out the glass was dirty and i requested for another one. this is where everything went south. I was given 25 pairs in the next 45 minutes and non of them were working either they were so dirty that you cant see properly or not working at all(CINEPAX has active 3D, so powered glasses) they felt more like night vision goggles with a green tint. \nFinally i had enough and i went out to speak to the management who offered me to sit through the 6.30 show which i didn\u0027t want to as it wasn\u0027t possible for me all the time they kept on convincing me that as it was a new cinema that just open i should be understandable that not everything was working in order. upon my protest i was told to contact them after the movie and make alternate arrangement. Finally in the end i was offered to be accommodated on any day of my choosing for the screening of the movie but now i am having second thoughts as to whether i should go back and watch the movie with stale popcorn or splash a few more bucks and visit atrium instead..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-27T19:28:07+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-28T08:06:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100005246919211","name":"Sami Hashmi"},{"id":"100004957325068","name":"Uzma Ash"},{"id":"517243075","name":"Annie Ali"},{"id":"1014052691","name":"Natasha Arif"},{"id":"100000424156000","name":"Afza Khan"},{"id":"100000170759285","name":"Abbas Sajjani"},{"id":"739231013","name":"Aiya Quli"},{"id":"1551738621","name":"Syed Yousuf Aßidi"},{"id":"720924223","name":"Ayeshah Farooq"},{"id":"100004072783257","name":"Rija Ahmed"},{"id":"505580927","name":"Nabil Babar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA1NTgwOTI3","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"562968297087658","from":{"name":"Nabil Babar","id":"505580927"},"message":"agreed.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-27T19:31:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"562973800420441","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Well after this, im cancelling my plans for sure ..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-27T19:48:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"562974953753659","from":{"name":"Haseeb Qamar","id":"502813985"},"message":"honestly i would want them to fix things and fast cause it can be alot better and i have a free ticket :D.. i bet 2D would still be enjoyable but  if you are planning to watch iron man than go to atrium","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-27T19:51:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"562976720420149","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Atrium is too far.

Not extraordinary, maybe even a little bland. \nWas looking forward to the egg rolls the most! The description immediately caught my eye and its been forever since I had a good egg roll. The filling was perfect! The avocado was a perfect addition to the classic egg roll BUT, and it is a big but, it was just toooo oily. Literally dripping with oil. Not very appetising. \nOn to the cappuccino- it was cold-ish. The biscotti served with it was soggy and when we informed the waiter of it, he took it away and never came back.
