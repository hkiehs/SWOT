Submitted a post on KFD and SWOT. Case closed. \n\nApparently that was unacceptable to the Brand Spokesperson PIZZO. \n\nI was intrigued that such a position even existed. My initial reaction was that it was a superficial attempt only to combat bad reviews from customers on facebook and was therefore limited to the various food pages with no intentions of improving or bettering the quality of service / food.\n\nA little later I was contacted by the spokesperson, l would like to add here that I have had many such conversations on numerous occassions with various representatives of franchises, both local and international. What you usually get is a series of apologies and promises. Quite run of the mill really. So I was ofcourse not looking forward to having yet another. However this Brand SpokesPerson, although apologetic was no YES man. I soon found myself discussing in detail the various shortcomings of the meal I had ordered the previous night. It was genuine and I felt there was an eagerness to improve. On his insistence I was compelled to try the new and improved version of what I had ordered. \n\nThe pizza was a cross between the vegetable and pepperoni pizzas that are currently offered on the PIZZO menu. \nSundried tomatoes, capsicums, mushrooms and ofcourse Pepperoni on a thin crust.  \n\nI have to say in all honesty it was a huge improvement, not earth shattering or ground breaking but nevertheless memorable in its own way. In any case something I see myself ordering again. \n\nWhat needs to be understood and appreciated here is that there are a large number of restaurant owners on these pages, all of them are very aware of the comments being posted about their restaurants, I have been contacted by a lot of them over the course of time due to the posts I have submitted, however I feel PIZZO has taken customer service a step further with this. \n\nWhen one customer is made to feel special by taking into consideration his or her feedback and to see that feedback implemented not a few days later or a few weeks later but right there and then, that is when you know the place means buissiness.\n\nIn this case my compliments to the brandspokesperson PIZZO, all I can say is that PIZZO is lucky to have you on their side buddy. \n\nP.S: I would like to state for the record, that the Pizza that was delivered was in no way complimentary and was not an attempt to garuntee a good review. I can assure you I would not have taken kindly to that.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-30T16:12:00+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-30T16:12:00+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"680185313","name":"Khalid Ishaq"},{"id":"507428445","name":"Yasir Khan"},{"id":"513232132","name":"Nazia Latif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEzMjMyMTMy","before":"NjgwMTg1MzEz"}}}},{"id":"165861103465048_418692474848575","from":{"name":"Fatima Yousuf","id":"588167591"},"message":"Salam, This Eid we are doing an Eid event at National Institute of Child Health.
