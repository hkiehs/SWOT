The caesar salad is always a favourite, and CBG does it best. \nDinner consisted of a classic creamy and flavourful fettucine alfredo pasta, and the pesto pasta as well; and it\u0027s actually hard to find a pesto pasta that actually tastes like PESTO. The chicken and feta cheese pizza was absolutely delectable, it was bursting with different flavours and has found its way into my favourite pizzas of all time! I can\u0027t wait to try more flavours. And how can we forget the healthy piccata chicken, which was beautiful and tender. Recommend for anyone who wants a balanced but delicious meal. \nDesert! That means perfect bread pudding and gooey chocolate lava.

But then again along with the cutlery, food presentation not being fancy (which is fine when you’re paying lesser than your fine dining restaurants) does the food quality have to be so poor as well? \n  \nSo here is my review as was agreed by the 8 out of 10 people with me. \n  \nWe had a reservation for 10:30 for 10 people, we got there for about 10:35 had to wait 15 mins for our table to get ready. \n  \nOrdered Hot and sour soup, prawn tempura and garlic chicken wings for starters. The wings were nice (a friend suggested I however did not try them so cant comment) the tempura were ok the soup would have been great had there not been the over powering taste of coriander (am I getting it wrong or has coriander always been an ingredient in a Hot and Sour soup?). \n  \nFor mains, we played safe and ordered Vegetable fried rice, mix chow mein, chicken in black bean sauce, beef with vegetables and STIR fry beef with broccoli (STIR fry just to mention again) and Chicken with mushroom and oyster sauce. The chicken with black bean sauce was edible but nothing great, the STIR fry beef with broccoli was as a friend put it “Beef Broccoli salan” I mean wouldn’t STIR fry mean a dry dish and not one with a thick grey gravy where the broccoli is floating? Whereas the beef in the Beef with vegetables tasted like the “gosht (used to indicate desi taste of meat) of an aloo gosht salan that may be slightly undercooked. \n  \nThe service was far beyond SLOW, not once were we asked if our food was ok or if we needed anything we had to call out atleast 2 times for each extra thing that we needed. We were served rice and 2 mins later the chicken with black bean sauce and after a good 7 mins and a mention to the manager we were served our other dishes minus the chicken with mushroom and oyster sauce. \n  \nI mean was it a bad day for Ginsoy or do my taste buds and service expectations (along with the majority of our table) need fixing?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-13T08:11:54+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-13T18:40:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"508353910","name":"Asma Uzair Warsi"},{"id":"612365902","name":"Uzma Jahangir"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"100001770091484","name":"Maria Tahir-Shah"},{"id":"100000349262919","name":"Fiza Khuhro"},{"id":"740390246","name":"Jahanzeb Jahangir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQwMzkwMjQ2","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"423701461014343","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100003681493822"},"message":"i dont like ginsoy food too..i totally agree with u just bcause its light on pocket i wouldnt eat a below average meal.i went there once,service below average,food has never wanted me to go back again.though a couple of times few friends have suggested to go n dine there i have given other alternate suggestions to go to ..i wondered if i was the only one...lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-13T08:19:13+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423701787680977","from":{"name":"Aiza Khawaja","id":"506031208"},"message":"You\u0027re not the only one !
