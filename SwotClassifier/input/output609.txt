The veggies though seemed to have been added in the end, something we didn\u0027t expect but didn\u0027t really mind\n\nGoan blue crab curry: Waiter recommended we have it with rice, the curry was delicious but it was really difficult and messy to eat with the crab, specially with rice. How does one eat this?? I ended up extracting the meat and then having it with Naan. Syed Ali Raza Abidi, maybe crack the prawns open for easier access before serving?? it was delicious though!\n\nPrawn makhni: deeeelicious!\n\nTsunami prawns: Poor waiter had forgotten and served it in the end. The prawns were perfectly cooked but there was just tooooo much sesame and we peeled some off. i was expected three different chutneys but got only one, so i inquired with the waiter. he said this is the only chutney but graciously brought us the imli and red chutney we get with the fish too. The original chutney was spicy but had a latend kick meaning the taste lingered but didnt kick in, the red chutney was awesome though!\n\nBOTS is a favorite and maybe the above foods need a minor adjustment, we went home full and happy in the end!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-22T05:31:03+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-23T10:14:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002785190370","name":"Vseem Gaved"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"732701791","name":"Saeed Umar"},{"id":"1415702282","name":"Sadia Bilwani"},{"id":"736425186","name":"Maryam Zahoor Ansari"},{"id":"1793536667","name":"Faiza M.

Yes with full teeth marks an all. Needless to say , we were shocked And showed it to the manager . Who just took the dish back And said we won\u0027t be charged for it. It was obvious that they were recycling thier salad. So mabye someone before us hadnt finished his salad, which was then served to us, but with a little souvenir . ....Anyway after that My husband didn\u0027t feel like ordering anything else and the rest of us also decided to leave. We were charged for the meal, even tho I returned mine half eaten. They did not charge for the meal with the chewing gum. Immediately I thought I would post this incident on SWOT as I was shocked that the management were least bothered with the horrible experience we endured. however I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt and called the owner . After telling him of our experience, he apologised And said he was glad that I called him first And would definetly look into the matter and that we shouldn\u0027t have been charged for the entire meal. He said he would get back to me... Well it\u0027s been over 4 months and i think I have given them plenty of time to get back to us!!  it\u0027s sad that such a popular restaurant , has such a casual attitude and also believes in recycling left over salad.
