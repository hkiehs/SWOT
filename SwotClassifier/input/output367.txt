Placed to order for 7 and the delivery guy rang the door bell promptly at 7. As promised the food was piping-hot and in huge quantities. I ordered 5 dishes\n\n- Drumsticks in spicy sauce: The best out of all the dishes I ordered. The sauce was a great addition to a Chinese classic 9/10\n- 2 chow meins mainly prawn and chicken chow mein and beef chow mein: I believe that the test for judging the quality of food of any Chinese restaurant is ordering a prawn dish. Though I was specified by the person taking my order that the prawns would be properly cleaned, a few of the prawns still had that black vein running through them and that really put us off. The beef chow mein was more a vegetable chow mein with a couple of chunks of beef thrown in. Over all a 4/10\n- Ordered 2 gravy dishes mainly Beef with chillies and vegetables and sweet and sour fish: Both dishes should\u0027ve been cooked at least 15 mins more as the gravy was too runny and the onions and tomatoes were practically raw. 6/10\nThough this huge amount of food only cost Rs 1990 I still feel that I paid a lot for the quality of food that was delivered. Very disappointed!!\n\nAfter reading the reviews the last couple of people who ordered food based on the reviews posted here, I feel I too am just blue!! :(","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-23T15:17:07+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-25T01:48:22+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000961720252","name":"Nouman Soorty"},{"id":"1368416951","name":"Muhammad Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM2ODQxNjk1MQ\u003d\u003d","before":"MTAwMDAwOTYxNzIwMjUy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"591151574269330","from":{"name":"Saher Shaikh","id":"539145384"},"message":"Oh and one more thing.
