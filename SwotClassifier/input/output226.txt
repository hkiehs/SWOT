They turned out to be pretty nice. Specially considering your tagline \u0027saaf shafaf\u0027 - well they kinda sold that to me too! I went on and referred it to my office people, from where we called to place an order. It was a total of 5 bun kababs plus other stuff.\n\nTheir franchise person, very conveniently said \u0027we don\u0027t deliver\u0027 (when it was clearly mentioned on the pamphlet that they do). We chose to send our rider. When the order arrived, it was pretty messed up with bun kababs missing and another swapped for a wrong one. THIS, when i had repeated the order again and again over the phone and gave a written order to my rider as well. \n\nWell, this would have all been fine, unless the same franchise person decided to misbehave. I called him back and asked him to fix the order. He initially decided to completely blame ME for the unfortunate event and then later banged the phone ON MY FACE with the line \u0027HUM NAE KARAINGAY EXCHANGE\u0027 (like literally shouting- *i wish i could add an audio here so as to acquaint you with the pitch of that bloody voice my ears had to bear) when my office is JUST a 2-min drive from their clifton franchise.  I think they need to revisit their \u0027business tactics\u0027. \n\nTo ACTUALLY establish themselves as the \u0027first desi food FRANCHISE\u0027, they really need to act like one and not like the gali ke nukkarh ke burger walay.
