Just my personal disappointment despite having given repeated feedback over the past six months, nothing seems to have changed for the better. Even today while ordering, I particularly specified that I needed the burger cooked medium and some semblance of blue cheese rather than a sauce. Told them that previously there had been problems and was assured that it would not happen again. What I got was a well done hunk of meat with some cheese sauce that made for a very soggy burger. Accompanied by fries that felt like they had been originally cooked a while ago, it really was not a pleasant meal. To be fair, Mariyam Masood\u0027s chicken burger was apparently better than mine. \n\nHowever, I have tried to be fair but think that finally I cannot continue to order from them. We had great experiences with them during Ramazan and even when their deals ended, kept ordering fairly frequently till the quality began to slide. Made them aware of things and refused the free food offers, just wanting better burgers next time. Sorrry to say, it just has not happened and today just was the final straw. I completely respect the fact that this is my own collection of mediocre experiences, and others may have good ones which is great for them.
