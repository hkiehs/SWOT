Opted for ala carte as the Iftar deals everywhere have so far been useless and overpriced. We were given a complimentary Iftar platter with dumplings, spring rolls and fried chicken strips which was very good - 1 platter was for 2 people. For mains we ordered wasabi prawns, blackened beef, chicken cashew nuts, Thai green curry, stir fry chili chicken, honey roasted chicken with sesame seeds, a fish dish garlic rice and noodles. Apart from the honey roasted chicken which was too sweet, everything else was fantastic.  Each of the dishes had their own unique flavor. Wasabi prawns were just okay - I think they used to be better before. Overall we were 12 very happy people. i thought it was quite pricy - came to about 1800 per person, but we ordered quite a feast.

The food tasted good, good variety though i would have preferred a couple of more meat based dishes, its too much vegetarian oriented. I tasted Dhokla for the first time and simply LOVED it.\nAlso it was quite economical as there is a buy one thali get one free offer going on, so we ended up paying less than 500 per head.

I had both steam chicken and flamed grilled one. Not much of a difference, guess its personal choice what to opt for. Both the chicken flavours were to the core, perfectly tender, no blackened skin and proportion smaller (if compared to Nandos). Sideline Mash potato, rice and corn all of them were good but serving them on flat plate made them cold quicker. We had chocolate Eclair as desert, pastry was hard, cream didn\u0027t feel fresh \u0026 light so I had better then this. Now the price or value for money I would rate 6/10. If you compare it with Nandos where quarter chicken is Rs240 then they servinf for Rs425 (though it is served with garlic sauce, row sauce, tabouleh, pickle \u0026 pita) but still this shouldn\u0027t increase the price so much.
