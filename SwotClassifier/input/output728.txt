The eating out then meant fine dining, exquisite food prepared for those who knew what it meant to dine out.\n\nIn the 1980\u0027s we as children had only a few Chinese places to go to or the clubs (I meant the Sindh or Boat)\n\nThen 1990\u0027s saw a change pioneered by the legendary COPPER KETTLE that transformed the whole zamzama dynamics and many amazing places offering interesting choices and cuisines started mushrooming everywhere catering to every pocket and palate.\n\nToday I was invited to have a cup of tea with an old prodigal friend. The venue was the-under-construction site of his new up coming restaurant.\n\nHaroon Leghari had, a long time ago professed his passion and desire to have a unique place where he could translate onto a plate what he has learnt about foods from around the world. \n\nSome people go into this business to make money (which is fair) and they run it like a business, and do fairly well for a business, some start it because their friends and family love the food they cook but lack the discipline and dedication to run it. HL has been dreaming of this place from way back when even before I have known him.\n\nHe is a smooth talker and a total cad - a reputation he adores and has cultivated to an art form - but what he has proved many a times is that he knows his food and how it should be served.\n\nHOOK LINE \u0026 SINKER is literally on its last paint job and fittings. And we hope that it launches with a bang very soon. Coz I can\u0027t wait to dine in the ambiance that\u0027s already been created.\n\nWe on SWOT wish you all the best and can\u0027t wait to critique the hell outta you......but then that\u0027s what you will enjoy.

Menu is rather limited and although it is presented rather nicely on a chalk board, the menu does NOT mention prices! That is bound to give many a heart a bit of an arrhythmia, specially those who will be paying the bill for the evening! The bread basket (served on a plate) was rather abbreviated. Clam chowder was nice and thick with the right amount of solids, but too tangy. The seafood gratin was too salty and the Verde chicken was a surprise: sweet more than savory. Perhaps it was meant to be so (fusion of some sort) but since there was no description available on the menu board, nor volunteered but he waiter, the first bite came as a bit of a shock. The place offers 3 items in its desserts, of which one was not available. Brownie with ice cream was fine (but it would be tough to go wrong with that) and the other available item, the lemon tart, seemed to be in two components, the top totally dissociated with the bottom. Coffees were excellent.\nAlthough we had chosen to sit inside the glass box, but the excellent atmosphere was destroyed when a bunch of school boys decided to start smoking in the closed environment. Midway through the meal we had to make a request to be relocated outside. The inside part of the restaurant should be strictly non smoking. Outside was actually more pleasant this evening than the air-conditioned inside. \nVerdict: We will certainly revisit Verde again…..for coffee, after dinner at Aylanto!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-02T17:36:31+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-02T19:38:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"622525326","name":"Mohsin E Azam"},{"id":"1035164226","name":"Daniyal Aamir"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"516133963","name":"Haadia Farooqui"},{"id":"881200022","name":"Amna Alam"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"558690791","name":"Zehra Zaidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTU4NjkwNzkx","before":"NjIyNTI1MzI2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"455059737878515","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"And I thought I was the only doctor who is a food critique in town. \n\nThank you for a very detailed and surgically precise review.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-02T18:02:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"455089874542168","from":{"name":"Amenah Jafarey","id":"671130091"},"message":"Love this AC.
