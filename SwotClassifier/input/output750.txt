After reading the amazing reviews for CBG here, we were expecting really good food. The iftar buffet was not bad to be fair - my husband liked the mini burgers and the seafood gollay. I thought the hummus was quite nice as well. Didn\u0027t try the cholas, pakoras, jalaibee or baras. The stir-fly chowmein was bland, oily and not worth the calories. The lassi was really awful. Didn\u0027t taste like a yoghurt drink but like very sweet (and strangely thick) milk. \n\nThe main course was disappointing. The Thai green curry was like a spicy salan with some lemongrass. My husband ordered the grilled chicken skewers and seafood platter. Very average in taste. For dessert, we tried both offerings - the brownie and the bread pudding. The bread pudding was nice - a little rubbery but the best part of the serviced meal. The brownie didn\u0027t have a chocolate kick and was a little overbaked. Overall, I am not going back for the food in a hurry. \n\nOn a positive note, despite the cramped seating arrangements (you realise how small the place it is when it is seating to capacity) and the fact that the place was packed, the staff was very, very friendly and tolerated my toddler and two other kids running riot (mine practised her fairy dancing and then played \u0027chase\u0027 with another little girl) while they tried to navigate the narrow path to serve the mains. Full marks on that count!\n\nI probably would not have commented on this (a mediocre iftar is hardly a shocker) if it had not been for the rave reviews posted here.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-14T06:25:31+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-17T11:43:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"680185313","name":"Khalid Ishaq"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"1454993708","name":"Tehniyat K.

Sensible ‘cause it’s NOT all fried food, different ‘cause it’s not the same old bastardization of typical high-tea/Iftar items. The Dahi-pulkiyan were better than burns road, the Pokoras were too (personally best I’ve ever had, and I’ve had my share : ) then there was the fresh salad w/ a lovely and equally fresh vinaigrette, a decent hummus, the most perfectly sautéed chicken wings (“jin ke size per maat jana”…had plenty of perfectly succulent meat on it ; ) in a sweet \u0026 sour smother : D and the mini burgers (better than the big one I had@GunSmoke last night, which was a damn fine burger in its own right) but this atypical out of this world finest meat on a lightly toasted bun just blew me away!!!  The brilliant sea food poppers w/ quality tartar sauce made this Iftar and dinner really stand out from the pack. And I haven’t even gotten to the dollars and cents yet… We’ll get to that in a minute. \nIt is also worth mentioning that the buffet had several other items which I couldn’t even try, simply cause there is a limit to how much I can eat : P but others told me of the oriental noodles, and other items I can’t even remember. \nWhat a deal, 5star quality (and I don’t mean pakistani-5’ishtaaar…but international standard) food which included 4 different types of bottomless drinks, the buffet as mentioned above, and ofcourse the 6 or 7 different main courses from CBG’s fabulous menu and a choice of desserts (two to choose from, the brownie-alamode w/ Belgian chocolate sauce, and vanilla ice cream, or the best bread pudding on the strip ; )\nPer head cost including a very generous tax and tip…only Rs.1300/person. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST QUALITY ONE CAN FIND FOR THIS PRICE!!! I felt like someone had transported me back to the Musharaf when  Rs. 1300 was a whopping US $22, whereas today it is a meager $14…I had street food for more than this-  Hussain Tariq, u must be a magician ‘cause the freshness and high quality for this amount can’t yield profits, but will surly capitulate relationships and gr8 memories : )))))))))))))))))))","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-09T20:02:48+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"422621937788962","from":{"name":"Saira Faruqi","id":"521702664"},"message":"Wow, what a fantastic review .... next stop, CBG!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-10T04:57:01+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"422629384454884","from":{"name":"Sirosh Ishaq Usman","id":"718110423"},"message":"yum","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-10T05:28:48+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"422666621117827","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Shaikh Fawad Buddy thank you for such a lovely review, have made our team read both the reviews yours and Reshma one as well!!

Pasting it here for food businesses to see.  -----------   I figured out why Apple is what it is yesterday and reinforced my love for the brand and why legacy of Steve Jobs continues! My 6 year old daughter by mistake shopped for some virtual coins thru an application worth $1000. And with just one email, they reverted in less than 5 mins and confirmed reimbursement. And the message that I got from Apple representative was even more amazing: \u0027Thank you for your kind words. I\u0027m so glad to hear that your issue with the accidental purchases is resolved. Actually I should be the one to thank you. I know that this is inconvenience on your part, but you have been very kind, patient and cooperative. Nothing makes Apple happier than to hear that we have pleased our customers\u0027. And that\u0027s a real wow experince!!! Imagine the support system, processes and authority that they provide to their team to resolve such millions of issues in minutes.--------      My key takeout here is providing processes and authority/decision making power to your teams (restaurant managers/waiters/call centre ppl) to make decisions and ensure customer satisfaction. When you tell a customer you\u0027ll get back to them, you\u0027re giving him a window of a few hours/days to go and whine about his bad experience. Many times, managers lack the confidence to make an on-spot decision. At smaller eateries, if the guy gets your order wrong, he gives u the typical sob story \"meri tankha mein se kaat lein gai\", so u feel bad for the guy and end up eating something u didnt really feel like. While alot of restaurants have implemented this practice, others who haven\u0027t should look into it.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-17T04:24:39+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-17T08:14:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"626900866","name":"Shahzad Qureshi"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"646650712","name":"Ambreen Dossa"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ2NjUwNzEy","before":"NjI2OTAwODY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"425011957549960","from":{"name":"Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi","id":"684515056"},"message":"Henna Javed :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-17T05:38:30+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1539480697","name":"Henna Javed","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"425012480883241","from":{"name":"Henna","id":"1539480697"},"message":"Awesome anecdote.

It was. \nSo I called the waiter for a replacement and I was told that I had already drank from it so they couldn\u0027t replace it.

I insisted i would not be paying for the cold coffee but my family dislikes confrontation and my brother quietly told the waiter he would pay for it.
