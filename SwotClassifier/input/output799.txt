Both were really good, I like the Chilli Prawns better. For the Main Course I ordered Chicken \u0026 Jalapeno pasta which I loved. For dessert we ordered Creme Brulee which was really odd. It looked really different from any Creme Brulee ive had and the Caramelized layer was way toooooo thick...like fat sheets of hard candy and a little burnt...sticky situation for the teeth, not attractive plus I forgot my hammer at home, usually I keep it in my purse...my luck!\n\nThe service was good and the waitstaff very courteous. But one thing they must change is the music...what is up with a place done up the way Saffron is but playing Lady Gaga \u0026 Beyonce\u0027s Telephone, Shakira\u0027s Waka Waka, Justin Bieber\u0027s whatever it is that he sings and 1 more that I cant remember and all ON REPEAT!?! I mean some nice chill beats with maybe a little Talvin Singh type stuff thrown in would\u0027ve completed the audio visual...it really threw me off, the audio \u0026 the visual going together is so important for a restaurant\u0027s ambiance I believe but then again I also believed that miniature unicorns existed when I was a kid, I knew the normal size ones were obviously a myth...so anyway, what do I know.\n\nAnyhow, moving on along a decent experience, would go back to try other stuff on the menu. I did notice that all their ingredients were pretty fresh...Ive learned that to judge a restaurant\u0027s food quality here in Karachi or maybe in all of Pakistan..one of the things you can look for is how fresh the iceberg lettuce is, and it was pretty darn fresh for that late in the day so that was a definite PLUS! They were right on with the fresh ingredients.\n\nOH YEH! Almost forgot....one last thing if you own this place, you might want to tell your waitstaff that when they bring out the pepper mill for your pasta or anything of that sort, they might want to hold it closer to the plate and not a couple of feet off the plate in the air, the fans and ACs were on pretty high and pepper loves getting in your nose. Something about pepper and noses, they never could get along...eyes are also with the noses on this one.\n\nAnyway, the place is nice and I can see a lot of effort has been put into designing it so that\u0027s it, im gonna go finish my pasta that I got parceled...yummmmmm  :D","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-25T22:28:38+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-27T15:15:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"714115614","name":"Nefer Sehgal"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"643423090","name":"Junaid Zuberi"},{"id":"511487130","name":"Beenish Barlas"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"752330337","name":"Faiz Kazi"},{"id":"515674780","name":"Ali Raza Pir"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"},{"id":"502637248","name":"Ather Ul Islam"},{"id":"527710365","name":"Hira Tareen"},{"id":"788400499","name":"Rehman Aziz"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz","before":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"416929561691533","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Waiasay ajj kal Qawaali laggi honi chaiyay herr jagah :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-25T22:32:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417043231680166","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Zara....welcome and am loving the review. \n\nYou went to Dinner WITHOUT ME!!!!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-26T05:33:36+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417059078345248","from":{"name":"Bilal Alvi","id":"641495625"},"message":"ahahahahahahaha! i loved the review! made me laugh out loud \u003dD","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-26T06:51:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417164155001407","from":{"name":"Saira Faruqi","id":"521702664"},"message":"That was fun reading :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-26T14:54:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417429431641546","from":{"name":"Aves Cochinwala","id":"100000661921576"},"message":"Tsk, tsk Lady , u got it  all wrong .

I am not tough to please but it seems like everything went wrong yesterday. Yes the delivery was on time and the food was burning hOt, even the quantity of food was enormous. The taste is where all the probs occurred :/ the American chop suey was unedible. It was extremely sweet to the point where I could even categorise this as dessert! Not a very good dessert but it had enough sweetness to be in the category!  My 3.5 yr old who is a die hard fan of ketchup+rice took a bite and told me that \"the dentist said if you eat too many sweet things you will get ants(cavities) in your teeth\" and pushed it away. The kungpao tasted like homemade Chinese food nothing authentic about it, and the chicken with basil had no taste of basil in it. On the upside the drumsticks were yum, delicious and flavourful, juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Too bad we only ordered one serving of that since we all tried to stuff ourselves with that only. It was shocking to see such great reviews about GD, the food reminded me of a mr.maqsood Chinese caterer who cooks at your place in case of an event-he\u0027s very cheap yet very avg. and his food tastes absolutely nothing like authentic Chinese food. Anyways, after getting the stink eye from everyone at the table yesterday and trying to actually bribe the servants to switch their keema aloo with our Chinese food(which they did not) I don\u0027t think I will be ordering GD again. Chairman Mao is what I\u0027m sticking with for my Chinese food cravings :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-27T09:45:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417473581637131","from":{"name":"Zainab Mansoor","id":"548006350"},"message":"I guess tomorrow was an off day - Its so surprising to hear bad reviews about a place like GD who takes quality and customer service so seriously!
