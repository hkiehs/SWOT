I recall a post a few months back in which someone shared her experience at some fancy restaurant where she found the tablecloth dirty that person\u0027s post also met with some snide comments. Plus if someone is posting about waiters being unprofessional or service being bad why it has to turn into a thing about financial disparity between different sections of society, or differences between privileged and under privileged. Why the assumptions about position of the poster ? so now it\u0027s up to you to let this post appear on your page or remove me from it I will not complain.
