Finally found the old waiters there, in a different uniform: Al-Rehman Chaat: opened next to Flamingo.\n\nordered Mixed Chaat \u0026 Meethi Dahi Puri from Flamingo.\nMasala Dossa and Aloo Masala from Cool-Inn\nAloo Chholay and Bun Kebab from Al-Rehman (the waiters insisted. they did serve us for over 12 years. i had to give it a go)\n\nFlaimngo\u0027s mixed chaat: its my favourite. a very good balance of meethi, khatti and hari chutney with dahi. flaws: they use very low amounts of yogurt and given inflationary pressures of prices of channas coupled with their prices people are willing to pay: the chollas are no longer kabuli. as a result they usually tend to be hard at the centre. Ive always had to ask for extra yogurt and then have had to resend it for pouring some more in. but the flavour is still the best i\u0027ve had of all places. \n\nMasala Dossa: its grown! i guess Mirchi took some clientelle away. and more loaded too this time! i didnt taste much curry leaves this time or mustard seed but it was still piping hot and crisp and massive!\n\nAloo Masala: erm. no. i make better. and ive had better from this baba who use to bring a small cooking pot filled with aloo masala from home next to Rainbow Centre. his were divine. i think he passed away. and i tried to recreate his at home. but his were the best. that thing about cooking with love? must\u0027ve been it. used to make a very small quantity but it was absolutely spot onn the flavour you\u0027ve heard of.\n\nUnfair of me to compare Cool-Inns with baba\u0027s. so why? well simpy cuz these aloo masala  from Cool Inn were big and chunky: the way they\u0027re supposed to be. but. the masala is kooti lal mirchi in not-very-bhunna hua tomato sauce. Masala needs to be well bhunna hua. if not it just tastes undone. and thats what cool-inn\u0027s was. i\u0027ll ignore it didnt have tamarind and thank heavens for autumn and flavourful coriander leaves otherwise i bet in teh summers id have flat flavoured coriander. \n\nnow Al-Rehman. \nbun kebabs were perfectly desi. thank God they asked if i wanted the typical or the one with ketchup and cole slaw: ICK!!! no no was good old desi egg-mashed lentil with onions and green chutney for me. moist. yum. desi bun kebab. you cant talk about theier flavours. no. not in words. you can just enjoy them. \n\naloo chholay: very home -made flavour. so i like\n\nthe one thing about alll three places today; everything was piping hot!

I called on the same number and i was told by this gentle man that the above price is just for the gravy and price for rice and noodles will be additional although the Face Book page says that gravy is served with rice and noodles and same is shown in the picture. \nHe explained me that the page has not been updated and the menu on this page is for Dolmen Mall only and for Home delivery prices and deals are different, as it was not our fault he offered to send us noodles and rice complimentary and while i was on the phone he started talking to his colleagues \"that how they have to serve free food to customers just because the page is not updated! \nwhat am i supposed to do with this customer complain? etc \" because i wasn\u0027t sure whether he was sending the noodles/rice i had to call him back to confirm because he didn\u0027t finish the conversation on last call, same thing happened again and i was told \" Madam ap ko bola tou meinay mein bhijwa raha hun rice/noodles\" and gave me deaf ear and put me on hold while he started arguing with his team members regarding my complain.\nI simply called the delivery guy to pass on the msg to the person who took orders, to provide proper customer service and not talk to others while the customer is on hold this doesn\u0027t put good impression on the customer nor do they have free cell phone line where they are calling from and can be put on hold for as long as they want. \nAnyways Noodles were delivered to us instantly within 5-10 mins which didn\u0027t spoil our appetite at all and as soon as we tried our dishes they were excellent, fresh, tasted simply great and different from what we are usually served in restaurants these days *which we are completely bored of same taste same menu*. \nIt was an additional plus point that my friend who is a vegetarian usually has problem in ordering in restaurants as its difficult to find food of her choice without chicken,beef, etc but simple dimple had variety of things to offer and also the stir veg she had ordered were simply commendable !\nSimple Dimple offered something new to our taste buds and we will definitely try more dishes from your menu \u0026 recommend to our friends and family but kindly improve your customer service and if this page needs update in terms of pricing and clarification whether gravy\u0027s are served with or without rice please do so.\n\nZoha Arshad Ali \u0026 Khumar Raza","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-11T09:10:19+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-11T10:26:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"514290400","name":"Hirah Sid"},{"id":"513274653","name":"Amna Hussain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEzMjc0NjUz","before":"NTE0MjkwNDAw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"458854050832417","from":{"name":"Hirah Sid","id":"514290400"},"message":"next time order Golden dragon or China ming","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-11T09:18:49+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"458856484165507","from":{"name":"Filza Hai","id":"889085130"},"message":"Golden dragon is great zo","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-11T09:32:11+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"458856660832156","from":{"name":"Zoha Abbas","id":"510223205"},"message":"what is it ?  i will try for sure","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-11T09:32:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"458857210832101","from":{"name":"Filza Hai","id":"889085130"},"message":"It\u0027s a home delivery for Thai n Chinese food only.
