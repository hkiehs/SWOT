Complementary bread with garlic, and cucumber n some other veg with cheese mayo dip served. Both were good n I would rate them 8/10. We ordered cesar salad, the chicken quantity was very less for the hefty price. 6/10 Crepe champs elysees was good but overall not very filling quantity, 9/10. \n\nNow comes the steak. Ordered djonnaise steak, I was told it will be local tenderloin but I guess it was fillet mignon since the width was about 1.5 inch but the size was really small making it a total of 200 something grams. I ordered medium well but it looked pretty much medium, I requested them for it to be cooked more since and they changed it without any hesitation. 9/10. BUT it still does not beat the steak I ate in dxb, not even close and not that big as well.\n\nDidn\u0027t order the choc lava cake which was another reason to go there cuz I saw the dish being served on another table and it looked too tiny with vanilla icecream. \nOverall a good experience but too expensive for the quantity (2800 for 3 dishes of which 2 are starters). 10% service charge was applied but since it wasn\u0027t written anywhere I asked the manager to deduct it which he did, saving me 200+ rupees.
