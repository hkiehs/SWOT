Usually avoid going to the fancy restaurants offering desi cuisine because let\u0027s face it, we all love the roadside food regardless of its hygienic value. Anyhow, this place has really come out as a surprise ! Our order included the following:\n- Nihari\n- Biryani\n- Haleem\nThe Nihari is an absolute treat for the taste buds considering I personally am not a huge fam of Nihari. Desi makes its Nihari in Yakhni and it is the sort that you don\u0027t barf all day after having some. The quantity was good enough for 5 of us. It\u0027s slightly less thicker than we usually have everywhere else. The one DESI offers is light and tastes exceptionally good as compared to other Nihari walas around. Highly recommended !\n\nDesi\u0027s Biryani is something that I have not skipped in the last two visits to this place. Those who have tried it know it very well so won\u0027t go into the details. Great quantity and taste. Easily the best offered among other competing restaurants.\n\nThe Haleem *sigh*. I thought I\u0027d never have Haleem anytime during the year except the Moharram season, but this was exquisite. Great taste with and without the condiments that come with it.\n\nA great addition to the \"desi\" eatery scene in Karachi and people who want to spare the khuaari of going to places like Burns Road and the likes, should definitely give this place a try !","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-16T13:29:12+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T12:01:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"520882045","name":"Ghulam Ali"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"100004118826944","name":"Talha Shahid"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"1060866489","name":"Saher Fatima"},{"id":"100003388785108","name":"Almas Altaf"},{"id":"1093133476","name":"Aly Ramzan"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"529620428","name":"Roomana Nasir"},{"id":"1109359970","name":"Altaf Suleman"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"825020244","name":"Bilal Ahmed Khawaja"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"100001121891691","name":"Maliha Aziz"},{"id":"1322402405","name":"Saqib Raza"},{"id":"1188460281","name":"Hira Mohammad"},{"id":"100003937801603","name":"Asma Malik"},{"id":"1533645688","name":"Zia Rehman"},{"id":"100000764441277","name":"Shahyaan Abd"},{"id":"581870213","name":"Saad Noma"},{"id":"524740437","name":"Ahsan Khawaja"},{"id":"100001822097920","name":"Sara Kazmi"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM4MjM2MTI1Ng\u003d\u003d","before":"NTIwODgyMDQ1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619612791423208","from":{"name":"Faiza Siddiq Ahmed","id":"570411310"},"message":"How much did it cost per head","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T13:36:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619613861423101","from":{"name":"Aly Abbas","id":"636734568"},"message":"A mere 300 per head","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T13:40:13+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619622014755619","from":{"name":"Abbas Lacewala","id":"1484122906"},"message":"wheres it located?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T14:06:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619622511422236","from":{"name":"Aly Abbas","id":"636734568"},"message":"Main Shahbaz, same lane as Gon Pacci","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T14:07:31+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619622761422211","from":{"name":"Rashid Sultan","id":"1013627848"},"message":"Whats the address or any FB page of Desi @Aly Abbas","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T14:08:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619623024755518","from":{"name":"Saad Noma","id":"581870213"},"message":"well man nahari was class of its own the perfect nahari which i wanted to have hats off DESI","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T14:09:00+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619623608088793","from":{"name":"Aly Abbas","id":"636734568"},"message":"Rashid Sultan Here you go\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pkDesiCuisine","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T14:11:03+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1013627848","name":"Rashid Sultan","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"619625098088644","from":{"name":"Rashid Sultan","id":"1013627848"},"message":"Thanks.... will give a try for dinner soon !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T14:15:38+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619641598086994","from":{"name":"Saad Noma","id":"581870213"},"message":"rashid do try nahari","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T14:51:12+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619641981420289","from":{"name":"Saqib Raza","id":"1322402405"},"message":"I loved the Haleem.

The place has been done up brilliantly. Staff is extremely courteous and very helpful. The complimentary bread basket served with garlic butter is possibly one of the best ones in town.

For main course I ordered the grilled beef wasabi sandwich while my friend ordered the ham burger. My sandwich was fairly good with a slight bitterness of wasabi, and while good I have had better sandwiches. The ham burger\u0027s patty was of quite a good proportionate size.

Well they said it for some reason surely.\n\nSattar Buksh with its catchy name and riding high on the internet media publicity and that too very creatively I have to give it to them the creativity behind SB is something out of your marketing text book. So the name is catchy it was very successful in creating the hype so how did it fare ? \n\nWell firstly the environment I would like the name of the interior designer and the architect it was so in sync with the name and the place. And they did a wonderful job and creating spaces where you don’t feel like you are all eating together with every other table in the house but rather how a café should be something espresso café and others could learn from. The flooring the walls the ceilings the artwork it isn\u0027t too much in your face yet not to subtle keeping it in line with the name. \nWell since it’s a café let me first talk about the chai and coffee. I think the elachi chai was amazing pretty good as good as the best chai dabas around in a comfortable environment but than again I don’t think I would be used to paying for 175 + tax for a mere cup of tea I mean you may have had it in your meetings in five star hotels but going for a casual cup of tea for 175+ is a big no no for me but heck I might go maybe but not for the tea probably for the coffee maybe because I love coffee more than my chai and they seriously did have pretty good coffee just the right temperature I had managed to try both hot and cold both were up to standard of your Gloria jeans or any other international coffee shop, priced similarly but I wouldn\u0027t go there in so much rush maybe when it dies down. \n\nHowever that is where it all goes downhill I seriously question if the idea is for  café or a restaurant because if they plan to make their earnings based on it being a restaurant with people occasionally ordering tea and coffee it is bound to fail they should immediately hire a new chef or something because the food is ridiculous no offence intended to anyone but the food was pathetic they don’t know how to make a pizza, a Panini in SB’s definition is a big fat loaf of bread with a bit of stuffing inside ( try butlers any given day and you will know what a Panini is ) butler is a nice example here they are not too fancy about their food but what they serve is pretty good. We were six people so I will tell the other four dishes the besharam burger again a very catchy name kudos to the guy who thought of it love the idea but the execution I have had burgers with sunny side up eggs in them but the chicken its bland no not just bland its pathetic to put it in your kitchen. Now the so called Bolognese roast burger seriously I know you guys want to be desi / angrez all at once and you have even kept the menu of bun kababs but this Bolognese burger was in the angrez section why did it taste like a bun kabab ? And not the good kind  either. Stuffed chicken penne pasta, admittedly the stuffed chicken was good but the pasta are you kidding I have made better pastas in my university days without even trying too hard. Stuffed Chicken with rice was nice because of one reason only was the chicken was the same as the pasta and that was nice. The waiter forgot our jeengalala dish which we thanked god for because after such disappointments I don’t think we could have bared another one. \n\nSheesha the only reason I mention sheesha in a separate section Is because I am big fan so I know what I am talking about well the sheeshas were nice very hygienic lots of options but 900+ tax for a sheesha I mean nowhere in Karachi have I had such an expensive sheesha. This is beyond expensive it’s a sheesha for gods sake the whole cost of making one is less than 100 rupees. Heck one whole sheesha itself costs you 3000 rupees 900+ tax for a sheesha is ridiculous Arabian or pink cadilac or for ppl of mohd ali good ol fakhir. \n\nService; well given the place was jam packed you could be forgiven for delay in service but what is unforgivable that the waiters don’t have a pen or pad to remember their orders I heard a few around me complaint about their orders and one of our dishes completely went missing when the food arrived.\n\nMy parting words I like what you are trying to do is a fusion between west and east, chai and coffee, burger and bunkabab but please change your food menu keep dishes on the light side rather than dishes with rice keep decent sandwiches nice pastas . Bring your price to a reasonable range because people might come for the hype but they need something else to come back for even those who have money to burn. But you never know Road Side café is still in business you might too with the same menu.As only SB can put it let me give it a try \" free advice hai leny hai tou lo warna tel lo \"","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-15T14:54:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T11:05:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"686500226","name":"Maira Uzair"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"61407780","name":"Zahrah Sehr Vayani"},{"id":"100000674735601","name":"Muhammad Patel"},{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"542900496","name":"Amal Anis Makda"},{"id":"1014345458","name":"Sadek Motiwala"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"630510285","name":"Azeem Afzal Motiwala"},{"id":"100003205271578","name":"Mahnoor Mukhtar"},{"id":"1292953231","name":"Aakash Kumar"},{"id":"597946799","name":"Alishba Shah"},{"id":"512868559","name":"Halima Sadia"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"701530707","name":"Zubia Ilyas"},{"id":"892195391","name":"Tehreem Fatima"},{"id":"647225359","name":"Sana Javeri"},{"id":"535320159","name":"Muhammad Saqib Khan"},{"id":"504319826","name":"Sarah Masood"},{"id":"1364547192","name":"Rabya Sultan"},{"id":"577409061","name":"Maaz Jamal"},{"id":"100003917951343","name":"Kiran Jabeen"},{"id":"672460650","name":"Yousuf Ali Sayeed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcyNDYwNjUw","before":"Njg2NTAwMjI2"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_619166518134502/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNjcyNDYwNjUw"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619168601467627","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Omg...
