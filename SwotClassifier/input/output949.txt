We want to clarify that at Tee Emm Mart the Bakery Kiosk is not a branch of Pie in the Sky, neither its a franchise. They make their own sandwiches of brown \u0026 white bread.

I have checked todays delivery \u0026 there is no brown bread \u0026 white bread sandwiches delivered to Tee Emm Mart. \nThey cannot use the name Pie in the Sky. They had been using our packaging but this will be reviewed if they will not improve.   \n We will make them restricted to follow our product \u0026 freshness guidelines.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-23T18:07:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"302103689840788","from":{"name":"Annie Agha","id":"514751939"},"message":"How about the brownies and cakes and cupcakes?
