It allows me to suggest new places to friends and relatives, even if I haven\u0027t been there, simply based on everyone else\u0027s reviews. My sister called me up tonight, and asked for dining out suggestions with my brother in-law. I suggested The Patio. Once they got there, my sister called up yet again, asking for suggestions. I told her to go on and order the Chicken Tournedos, since she\u0027s not a beef person, and any tapas on the menu. So, my brother in-law ordered the corn cakes, which he enjoyed, and then the Laal Maas Rajasthani for his entrée. My sister stuck to my suggestion and they loved the experience. They also got a complimentary bread basket with butter, and once their server noticed the butter had finished, got over a second one. My sister told me the bread basket was fresh and yummy, and the service was courteous and welcoming. They also found the decor appealing and cozy. They forgot to pick up the leftovers they had requested to have packed for takeaway, and were walking away from the restaurant when a server ran up to them with the food. My sister was heaping praises on the service, food and ambiance, which was within an extremely reasonable price range for such a lovely experience. Thank you, Patio people! You made my sister and brother in-law very happy, which made me very happy too.
