Got complementary naan and humus with salad etc as soon as we were seated. Ordered the huge arabic thaali, everything was pretty good. Wasn\u0027t something out of the box, but it was pretty good. The platter had 2 beef seekh kabas, 2 chicken seekh kababs, chicken tikka pieces and a shawarma roll, along with 3 drinks and 5 garlic naans that we ordered separately. Everything was in good quantity, and we couldn\u0027t eat the shawarma roll because we were so full. The final bill came to 630 rupees, which was pretty reasonable. \n\nRecommended place to go.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-04T21:19:12+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-04T22:29:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"719028214","name":"Rehmat Ebrahim"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"505484337","name":"Mian Saad"},{"id":"100005838280535","name":"Patio Pk"},{"id":"801354586","name":"Aisha Ali"},{"id":"540420360","name":"Qazi Shoaib Rajar"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Picked the burgers up from the \u0027shack\u0027, and had the \u0027Full House\u0027 with Loaded Fries.  The order was ready in like 15 minutes, despite a lot of demand.  They were easily churning out a dozen burgers every 5 minutes.\n\nThe succulent beef patty was probably the best I\u0027ve had this side of the Suez, and is clearly a couple of notches better than the standard burgers served by fast food joints, including international franchises.  The bun-patt ratio was just perfect, and the buns were fresh.  The condiments were not overflowing, and complemented the overall taste.  And finally the price was pretty reasonable, relative to burgers served by fast food franchises.  Not much to write about fries -- they were just the usual fries, cut in a fancy way.  It will be great if they can provide a choice of burger buns as well!\n\nThe burger can\u0027t really compete with gourmet burgers, but its probably the best fast food burger out there, and definitely way better than the eagerly awaited Burger King, and the now mini-Mac of McDonalds.  Hardees is in a different league though, as the patty there is charbroiled. \n\nOverall, a good experience.  Would rate it at 8/10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-04T01:06:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-04T20:00:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"512577683","name":"Salik Sajid"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"810870516","name":"Talha Sufi"},{"id":"901860640","name":"Mohammad Rafil"},{"id":"557576643","name":"Shariq Riaz"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"1579891410","name":"Erum Siddiqui"},{"id":"712751198","name":"Zareen Sultan"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"547005284","name":"Adeel Azhar"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"593385155","name":"Mubashir Zuberi"},{"id":"828050472","name":"Maisam Ali"},{"id":"568465423","name":"Yasir Hasan"},{"id":"500172130","name":"Agha Hamza Pathan"},{"id":"544070599","name":"Farhan Saleem"},{"id":"1285044693","name":"Sami Ibrahim Tamimi"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"600961078","name":"Azzah Sharif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAwOTYxMDc4","before":"NTEyNTc3Njgz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"597862913598196","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"nice review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-04T03:02:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597868500264304","from":{"name":"Em Jay","id":"100000065623735"},"message":"Onion rings are much better than their ordinary fries","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-04T03:22:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597869446930876","from":{"name":"Adnan Yasin","id":"723675110"},"message":"Every burger chain has its own uniqueness except for those who are completely waste of money.\n\nThose who are good ...have at least one burger of different type.\n\nHARDEE\u0027S ......
