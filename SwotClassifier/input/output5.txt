It surely gave my chicken wingssss... \n\nOk so we ordered 1 Zinger, 1 Beef burger with cheese, for our two outcasts :p \nAnd countless Qtr. Broasts (i lost count after the first 6)\n\nZinger: It looked appetising, amazing size good value for money. And by the look of the empty devoured plate in the end im pretty sure It was well enjoyed.\n\nBeef Burger with Cheese:\nOrdered by our second non brostie.\nUpon asking hi the rating went like \nIt was great..good.. Average tha..\nSo if u are trying to compare it to the BK ka whooper like we initially were trying to do, look the other way :p\n\nThe fried chickies aka Karachi ka Broast.\nThe first look: Defiantly huge portions.\nToo much on the oily side.\nThe fries looked like dead dried fishes. \nTaste: according to one fellow foodie the wings tasted like buffalo wings (i wouldnt know i fed mine to the kitties) \n\nPs: the fresh lime i ordered was nimbo pani with an over load of kali mirch.. Yeekkhh \n\n \nOverall:\nHad an average taste, very average nothing to rave about. All the hype is defiantly over rated.    \nService was very sad, one waiter running around the whole floor.\nWill not be going again for the food.\nBut then again the prices were dirt cheap so i wouldnt expect anything else. \n\nALSO after all that being said.\nAll those people who care about hygiene should avoide. \nThe place is crawling with cats. \nEven though i am well. But two of our members fell sick as soon as they reached home. Which is unacceptable.There was something seriously wrong with the chicken. So i think a visit from the health inspectors is due to that place.  \nUntil that i think im staying away.\n\nLast but not the least.\nThankyou everyone who joined us. Was a pleasure meeting you guys. :) \nHope to see you guys again real soon.\n\n*An invader from Foodies Food Invasions*","type":"photo","created_time":"2014-01-05T15:13:51+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-10T21:02:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000595182709","name":"Umair Chaudhry UC"},{"id":"100000605712128","name":"Kashif Jakhrani"},{"id":"100001971013076","name":"Zohaib Hassan"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"816865264","name":"Muhammad Arsalan Siddiqui"},{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"873280323","name":"Umair Zia"},{"id":"100001542765153","name":"Umair Zahid"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"100000107764417","name":"M Kashif Malik"},{"id":"1224016566","name":"Asif Rasheed Ghani"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"100002154180249","name":"Afifa J Maniar"},{"id":"617393721","name":"Ali Sheheryar Khan"},{"id":"100001075455207","name":"Ahsan Ahmed"},{"id":"568465423","name":"Yasir Hasan"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"1236316260","name":"Taimoor Nadeem"},{"id":"669320704","name":"Fahad Azad"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"742775803","name":"Nabeel Islam"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"517581738","name":"Armughan Ahmed Faruqi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3NTgxNzM4","before":"MTAwMDAwNTk1MTgyNzA5"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_677950858922734/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNTE3NTgxNzM4"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"677952425589244","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Thats the branch i got a tharki roach from, lin marofying on my food with his rather wiggly antennae! :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:17:48+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677952932255860","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"We missed u too Sohaaaa :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:18:59+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677953475589139","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"hahaha Me not tharki roach :p I m shadeedun shareefun :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:19:41+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677956665588820","from":{"name":"Syeda Wajeeha","id":"564340227"},"message":"Love there raita uff","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:26:25+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677957455588741","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Zaid Tehsin: ya sorry to burst ur bubble but they do and feel free not to read it though.
