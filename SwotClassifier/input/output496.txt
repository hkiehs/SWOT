Over the years, I have gone to Expresso and never really found the food particularly exceptional. Thus, when people kept talking about ordering from there, I was beyond skeptical and have recently realized, unfairly so. Given my love of club sandwiches, and having been spoilt by the Log Inn version, I have found it hard to find a club sandwich that I have liked as much. Many have been tried, some decent and some not. Nothing has approached that Log Inn Club. However, recently Mariyam wanted a sandwich of some sort and we ended up ordering her a blackened chicken one from Expresso and to give her company, hesitatingly I ordered the club. What a revelation! Both sandwiches were pretty good ... and the club was fairly comparable to my favourite Log Inn one. Just to make sure it wasn\u0027t a fluke (wink, wink), we ordered the same sandwiches again. This time, they sent my club but got Mariyam\u0027s sandwich wrong and sent roast beef instead. I called them and within 30 seconds, the gentleman on the phone had checked and confirmed that they had made a mistake and I was off the phone in less than a minute with a replacement sandwich promised and delivered ASAP! Good customer service and good food ... I was eating my opinion, and hereby acknowledge that I was unfairly hesitant to order food from Expresso! Finally, given these two good experiences, and my penchant for being a creature of habit, we ordered again ... with Mariyam trying the chicken burger while my club sandwich remained a constant. She really enjoyed the burger and every time that I have had the club, it has been fresh, well put together and tasty! While I must say that the Log Inn Club is still #1 on my list, Expresso has certainly become a worthy challenger. Kudos Expresso ... I guess I missed out all this time ... but no more!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-25T15:23:38+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-25T18:36:25+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"633230637","name":"Mahnaz Hadi"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"579933313","name":"Ali Daudpota"},{"id":"503886516","name":"Bilal Hameed"},{"id":"624168828","name":"Adil Mohammed"},{"id":"100001052122235","name":"Xarrin Faizi"},{"id":"553350590","name":"Faizan Chaghtai"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"100002408096899","name":"Syeda Amna Kazmi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNDA4MDk2ODk5","before":"NjMzMjMwNjM3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"561985313852623","from":{"name":"Mariam Lary","id":"1089603658"},"message":"There is no X in espresso...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-25T15:24:24+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false},{"id":"561985870519234","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"mea culpa, mea culpa ...
