I had the beef Doner Kebab meal. It was basically a beef Sandwich/Shwarma stuffed with beef ,fresh vegetables and a hot sauce  .It was actually pretty good....and tasted a bit too healthy . My only complaint with the eatery is that the staff isn\u0027t helpful at all especially the Turkish guy that was there , the entire menu is in Turkish so you kinda need a little help deciphering what is what. I asked him what was good and what is what he just made a non interested face and didn\u0027t answer , either he spoke no English or Urdu or he was just plain uninterested. I was only familiar with the words Doner Kebab , Shish Tauk and Iskender so I just opted for the Doner. But over all if anyone\u0027s on a diet and want\u0027s to eat a low calorie healthy meal Solen\u0027s definitely a good option.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-14T15:43:25+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-15T06:59:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"500212564","name":"Nida Haque"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"516854962","name":"Nauman Khan"},{"id":"505612031","name":"Batool Akhlaq"},{"id":"100001881992250","name":"Anum Rasheed"},{"id":"810525827","name":"Abdul Haseeb Shehzad"},{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njc3Mjk1NTYz","before":"MTIxMzYzNzA4Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"505552956162526","from":{"name":"Hassaan AY","id":"506869347"},"message":"Tum ishq-e-mamnoo ka naam letay phir woh tumhe menu Urdu mein dub kar ke sunata :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-14T17:15:57+0000","like_count":10,"user_likes":false},{"id":"505556759495479","from":{"name":"Danish Khan","id":"1547568629"},"message":"i think his english and urdu skills r next to non.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-14T17:28:12+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"505567009494454","from":{"name":"Batool Akhlaq","id":"505612031"},"message":"Yayyy.
