Had loads of corn and was loaded with chunks of boneless chicken. Thick and creamy with herbs.\nWas just perfect. I will be going back for more\nSame goes for the Hot and Sour.\nPlus the bread along with the soup that needs a separate thumbs up.   \n\nTheir Grilled fish is the best iv tasted.\nPerfectly cooked and steaming hot when it arrived.\n\nThe Charcoal platter ain\u0027t short of praises either. No wonder its the most loved. Was so full that couldn\u0027t try everything on it. But my friend loved it. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted yummiliious.\n\nOverall perfect food for this amazing winter, backed up by flawless speedy service.\n\nMy new go to spot for these winters :) who says Kolachi is the best on the strip, i suppose Charcoal has the tendency to give them a run for their money very soon. Really happy with the improvement in their taste and service.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-23T21:39:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-24T15:43:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"612205150","name":"Syeda Sara Hussain"},{"id":"100000340878641","name":"Ali Amin"},{"id":"100000114257107","name":"Rimsha Altaf"},{"id":"100000956691585","name":"Sauliha Qureshi"},{"id":"100003305271172","name":"Muhammad Shaiekh"},{"id":"805195531","name":"Amna Shah"},{"id":"100004286853739","name":"Mahwish Khawja Ghulam Rasool"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"100001758628950","name":"Muzzi Hussain"},{"id":"1311140673","name":"Yumna Salvatore"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"1560344939","name":"Zahid Qureshi"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"628832080","name":"Nuruddin Noorani"},{"id":"100002796731318","name":"Ruba Baig"},{"id":"1567906191","name":"Humera Abbasi Lari"},{"id":"100002068418798","name":"Sumaira Junaid"},{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"100002186645209","name":"Asma Uzair"},{"id":"100003197584619","name":"Mairaj Khan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"614890544","name":"Syeda Hareem Zahra"},{"id":"100000744651030","name":"Farah Sadiq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzQ0NjUxMDMw","before":"NjI0NjMyMDk5"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_671113466273140/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dMTAwMDAwNzQ0NjUxMDMw"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"671114849606335","from":{"name":"Rabeet Rao","id":"749204552"},"message":"Been heading to the Do Darya strip more than often (does 2 times in 3 days qualify to be more-than-often?), and Charcoal has been the top priority (after Kolachi).
