We started with the prawn biryani for starters which was quite good like last time followed by bbq red snapper in red masala, pangush in green masala and bbq prawns which were all delicious - the fish was super soft, had just enough flavor and was melting in our mouths. \n\nHad to get some takeaway so ordered a bbq red snapper to go as that was the best thing we had and once we opened it at home we found this piece of fish which looked more like a piece of raw meat and unlike what we had eaten at the restaurant 2 hours earlier. It was such a tough piece that we were having trouble even cutting it into 2 with a knife and fork. Not sure if it was a very old piece of fish or whale meat but it was disgusting to look and definitely not at all like what I had eaten at BOTS a little while earlier.\n\nNeedless to say we threw it away and will really think twice about at least getting take away from there. I understand restaurants can have off days etc and sometimes food can be cooked slightly differently but getting an extremely odd looking piece of fish or whatever that was cannot be acceptable!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-11T20:41:22+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-12T06:24:58+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz","before":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"377356975648792","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Darn! sorry about that.. and please its not whale :) Please call Ronica 021 35421190 for a replacement.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-11T21:40:13+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica","type":"user","offset":65,"length":6}]},{"id":"377487548969068","from":{"name":"Farah S.

The burger went well with my palate and it had that distinctive aroma of char-grilled beef patty ; my only pet peeve was the assembly , may be the bun (which I’d admit was fresh) could have been a tad bit smaller , but all in all it was scrumptious and I enjoyed every bite of it .\nThe Crème Brulee qualifies as the most favorite dessert as per the standards of my naïve and humble palate , It looks gorgeous rather ravishing with all that detailing in the way it is presented ; add to it , it’s just the right amount I would fancy considering how highly spissated it is with those calories (change the topic already !)\nBurnt Caramel Custard is yet again a dessert that holds on to it’s roots , perfect with the pristine and rich flavor of burnt caramel in every bite , it’s just awesome . . .\n\nThe service , well if my memory is serving me right , the manager was kind enough to visit us thrice to make sure if everything was going fine or not . Our waiter (prefer naming people but then don’t know the name as it wasn’t mentioned the way it usually is) was courteous, attentive and the fact that he was enjoying serving food to us and many others around was apparent from his body language.\n\nA little pet peeve of mine would be the size of the tables , had they been a little bigger . . . but then it gets nullified as long as the food that lands on them is perfection personified .\n\nSeeing the ever fastidious Jasmine enjoying her food was in itself an amazing experience and then she declaring the fact that if there’s one place she’d like to enjoy her Mother’s Day treat it has to be CBG ; it very well was a testimony to the culinary expertise that the team CBG embodies . From the time when we entered till the time we left , we felt being taken care of , and that’s the best an eatery can provide it’s customers with .
