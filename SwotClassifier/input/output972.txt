We had ordered a full course dinner (since we were told that they are only taking reservations with set menus for now).\n\nThe affair started with chicken corn and chicken ginger soups which were different than the usual fare. Followed by appetizing sesame prawns toast, salt n pepper calamari on a bed of herbs, crispy chicken spring rolls, vege-wontons and zesty wasabi prawns which were simply divine. The main course comprised of pepper beef, chicken lo mien, orange chicken, shredded crispy beef in bird nest and sesame chicken.  Overall, the culinary experience was a pleasant departure from the run of the mill local offerings in terms of recipes and presentation.  We were also told that the food is MSG free by the wait staff that was attentive and courteous.\n\nWith eight guests, the tab ran us around 1500per head which I think is excellent value for a delectable full course dinner set in a warm unpretentious ambiance. I wish them well and hope to return soon to try the signature Peking duck next time around.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-10T19:22:28+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-10T21:27:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"780381887","name":"Samar Husain"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"575486349","name":"Amber Rizvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTc1NDg2MzQ5","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"293873143997176","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"What...u ate all that widout moi!

Just working out a vocational program for the Deaf Reach School and I thought who better to ask for guidance than you! \n\nI would like to invite top line chefs to conduct one class of 2.5 hours each week to introduce culinary skills to deaf students. We have been running this program for a year with great success. \n\nThe goal is two fold: to teach them domestic and professional skills. \n\nIngredients and equipment can be provided at the school. We want great skills on display to create future professional chefs. On the other hand we also require recipes that can be replicated in lower income house holds. \n\nLet me know if you want to get involved in this interesting avenue to channel our love for food to less privileged and take this through the SWOT\u0027s channel.\n\nOn my end I have been contacting chefs, 5 star hotels and food manufacturers directly and of course that\u0027s a lengthy yet fruitful procedure.\n\nThanks so much for your time! \nSarah Shaikh\nMarketing Manager \nDeaf Reach School","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-10T10:35:17+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-10T12:04:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"100000128819211","name":"Sugarnspice Everythingnice"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"617612024","name":"Farzana Saeed"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"686712045","name":"Irfan Aslam"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzkyNDcwMTcw","before":"MTAwMDAxODU4NDUwMDEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"293601147357709","from":{"name":"Luciferz Angel","id":"792470170"},"message":"Wish I was a chef","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T10:38:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293601654024325","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"Lucifer u can assist me when I go for this :) :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T10:40:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293601800690977","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Chef Mohammad Naveed Chef Intizar Soomro Chef Sultan Mehmood Chef Muhammad Nawaz Chef Saqib Aman Chef","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T10:40:41+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100000299784504","name":"Chef Mohammad Naveed","type":"user","offset":0,"length":20},{"id":"100001994224242","name":"Chef Intizar Soomro","type":"user","offset":21,"length":19},{"id":"100002134022019","name":"Chef Sultan Mehmood","type":"user","offset":41,"length":19},{"id":"100000877426504","name":"Chef Muhammad Nawaz","type":"user","offset":61,"length":19},{"id":"100001582910974","name":"Chef Saqib","type":"user","offset":81,"length":10},{"id":"100003122893445","name":"Aman Chef","type":"user","offset":92,"length":9}]},{"id":"293601830690974","from":{"name":"Luciferz Angel","id":"792470170"},"message":"Aye Aye Captain!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T10:40:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293602284024262","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"@shahdab ul haq kidhar giya abb?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T10:42:12+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293603007357523","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"SARA yeh sab kiya SWOT ke members hain? \n\nI didn\u0027t know.
