It\u0027s called Apple Crumble : mix flour about two cups with approx half cup butter and quarter cup sugar together but don\u0027t mix it in a blender or with a spoon mix it with ur fingers like rub it together as if u were making small balls. It shouldn\u0027t  be mixed together like a pastry but be like a chooran. Peel and cut maybe 4 or 5 apples into quarters then slice them finely and lay the slices at the bottom of a lightly buttered dish. Cover the slices with the flour/butter/sugar mix and bake in an oven until the topping is crispy and golden, serve with cream or custard. The topping should be enough to completely cover the apples.
