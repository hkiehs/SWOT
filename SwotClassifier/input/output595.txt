Which was ok - I wouldn\u0027t call it pricy \n\nThe verdict:-\nThe onion rings are the best in town.....crunchy flavourful and the accompanying dipping sauce was licked clean.\n\nThe loaded fries - albeit huge and fresh were something I am not ordering again - first of all the guy at the counter explained the difference between the SHACK FRIES (plain) \u0026 SHACK LOADED (with cheese sauce and jalapeños). This was not the case the fries were freshly fried but still a little soggy and were covered in 2 different mayo and sprinkled with spring onion leaves. No cheese and no jalapeños.\n\nThe shack a Bon was decent not comparable to CINNABON\n\nComing to the burgers - the full house patties were under seasoned the burger had way too much mayo and as Reshma stated was soggy by the time it got home. I live 3 mins from there....was home and had started eating at exactly 6:08pm\n\nThe shroom was however very good and worthy of another trip.\n\nI did not like the bun which is totally the DAWN white meda whoosy one which just loses any identity once the sauces are on it. \n\nSo to quote Saifullah Mazhar - it was an ok experience not something I am willing to repeat anytime soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-05T17:56:13+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-06T08:14:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"509507958","name":"Omair Ahmed"},{"id":"639205190","name":"Ambereen Wahab Ilyas"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjM5MjA1MTkw","before":"MTAwMDAxODU4NDUwMDEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"513957598655395","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100003681493822"},"message":"Am glad u mentioned the bun as I totally forgot mentioning it :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-05T18:50:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"513965138654641","from":{"name":"Kamran Afzal","id":"606892840"},"message":"I hate too much mayo in burgers as well as sandwiches.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-05T19:07:05+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"513969085320913","from":{"name":"Aruna Dawani","id":"720217622"},"message":"I dont much care for mayo either in my burgers........thats why am a Mr Burger fan..........I would still like to try out this Burger Shack........but will ask to hold the mayo(thanx for the heads up)........now, THAT should tell us what their patty tastes like!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-05T19:20:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"513987961985692","from":{"name":"Rabiya Syed","id":"1453901313"},"message":"Something has definitely changed then if they are using the horrible Dawn burger buns.When I tried it their was just a small dollop of their own sauce and the buns were freshly baked.Sad to hear that they were not consistent with the quality even for a fortnight!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-05T20:05:46+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"513993061985182","from":{"name":"Kanwal Anes Ahmed","id":"504592087"},"message":"^ Agree with Rabiya.
