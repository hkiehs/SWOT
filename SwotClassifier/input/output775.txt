The Bread Basket equivalent with the Butter and the Olive Oil and Balsamic mixture went well with the Feta Salad as a starter. (The Feta Salad was by far the best I have had in Karachi so far).  Overall, a big thank you to Hussain Tariq for his personal interest in my order. The servings were very generous, I will add.

The food was great and so was the service and ambience. We ordered the iftar deal which included the GC mini platter (fish, onion rings, mozarella stick, chicken wings). Although the presentation was bad, it all tasted very good, except the buffalo chicken wing which had a very desi taste. For the main course I ordered American Chicken Burgeri(you must try it!), which I must say was totally yum. (picture below) The lemonade was okay (it was part of the iftar deal). \nThe only thing wrong was the presentation AND the service charges at the end which we had no idea about!
