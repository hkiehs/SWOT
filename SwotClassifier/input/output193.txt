The best part of the meal was the drink Load Shedding- an iced blend of red chilli, peppermint and some spice with Sting... it was awesome. And we also got to see the real \"Sattar Bakhsh\"... the dude had some really nice moustache!  Another plus point of the restaurant is  that they have the sheesha smoking area outside in the open air, good for those who want to enjoy a smoke free meal. They also have traditional offerings like paratha chai and bun kababs with slang names to add some pinch.

Fortnightly Pizzo indulgence at Chai Dhaba.  The best thing about Pizzo is that it can deliver Pizza in a timely manner at the most random places.\n\nOrdered the Pepperoni Pizza, and like always it was excellent.  Just the right amount of Cheese and Pepperoni, with a firm crust.  No one does a better Deep Pan Pepperoni than Pizzo.\n\nFor experimental purposes, also ordered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, and that was a major disaster.  The pizza was loaded with all sort of assortments, putting Pizza Hut to shame.  The guy taking the order said it will be spicy -- but I never thought spicy meant dumping half a bottle of tabasco sauce on the pizza.  There was just too much happening on the pizza, and the tabasco was overpowering.\n\nBeing a loyal Pizzo customer, the best combination to order from Pizzo is Pepperoni \u0026 Margherita.  Buffalo Chicken should be strictly avoided!\n\nOverall Rating (for this meal) -- 5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-16T11:04:02+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T12:53:25+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1668177824","name":"Omer Salimullah"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzMyOTE3OTY4","before":"MTY2ODE3NzgyNA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619702711414216","from":{"name":"Nasim Ahmad","id":"1343979604"},"message":"It\u0027s incredible how many pizzerias have opened in the past year and every one seems to have its fans.
