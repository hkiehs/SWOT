WOW what a beautiful place - i am already a fan of your work and was once again loved the way you have created the lovely cozy yet spacious ambiance with 44.\n\nthe staff is courteous and helpful, polite and cheerful - always a good sign.\n\nthe food itself ranged from excellent to alright. first the excellent dishes\n\n1) the chicken mousse and rice cake starter - tiny bite-sized portions - lovely to start off a meal\n2) the bread basket - with a variety of breads - each fresh and very good - i didnt need the garlic butter - it was lovely to nibble of the buttery salty breadstix on their own and the toasted flat bread with flax seeds nice touch.\nall except 1 starter we ordered were on Aman\u0027s recommendation and i have decided to let him order for me in future \n3) the sea food trio - with smoked salmon stack, prawn cocktail with a spicy tomato based dip and grilled fish with a avocado salsa - very good - and beautifully presented\n4) The Prawn Gambas - out standing - have already gone into the buttery details of this on the pic - a MUST try for all prawn lovers\n5) THE WOK FRIED CRABS - OMG serious love happening - already apologized to Syed Ali Raza Abidi for this but i think the affair with the Goan Crabs is over for a while.\n6) the Cajun chicken Cesar salad - this is NOT my fav salad to begin with - am not a mayo fan - but from what i sampled - it was fresh and very vibrant in colors and textures - taste was pretty good - but i would never order this anywhere in the world\n\nthen came the entrees - (yes we eat a lot)\n7) Angle Hair pasta with scallops, mussels calamari prawns and fish - garnished with sun dried tomatoes and fresh parsley - the sea food was totally fresh and perfectly cooked, the dish seasoned well - the pasta was a bit over done for my palate but then i know many here who dont like el dente - so it can be quite bothersome for a chef.\n8) the beef tenderloin with tarragon - and chocolate balsamic reduction - was the biggest steak (we estimated it to be about 300 gms - but Aman said it was between 250-275gms) cooked to medium rare (thu unfortunately this was ordered Medium) - the reduction was amazing - smooth and silky, sweet and tangy and perfectly balanced with the char grilled beef and the herbs. if i am not stuffed with the Gambas and the crabs on my next visit - i am ordering this - and i like mt steaks medium rare.\n9) the Chicken and Beef Burgers - both were ok and presented well, one with home fries and one with the most amazing gratin - when there is so much other stuff to try i wont be ordering burgers at a place like 44\n10) the red thai curry with chicken and steamed rice - actually better than Fuchsias\n11) chicken roulade in pesto sauce - the presentation, the sauce and the sides were great - the chicken itself a little dry but definitely something that can be looked into and i would recommend that for all kukur lovers (which thankfully i am NOT)\n\nafter all this food - we had no space for dessert and were going to skip off for some healthy apple tea that Abid Aziz Merchant has brought back from Turkey but Aman wont hear of that and sent us the three desserts on the house. \n\n1) Creme Brulee - hands down the best in town - smooth, silky, velvety and the perfect crust on top. this is one the simplest desserts to make but it defeats many a chef.\n2) Chocolate Fondant  cake - perfectly made - rich and decadent\n3) Bread and Butter pudding - like Cesar salad and chicken another dish i rarely order anywhere - was different from ALL its cousins in town and was actually very nice - served with a yummy homemade banana ice-cream - this i loved and will have with a little chocolate sauce. and maybe fresh bananas and caramelized walnuts (see Aman here is a new dessert - simple and easy)\n\nover all experience - was FABULOUS - and i am going to re-inforce my statement about AMAN VIRJI becoming a culinary force to be reckoned with in the near future  \n\nThank you 44 team you have just become one of my top 10","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-23T14:43:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-25T14:25:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"100001692464184","name":"Amna Jatoi"},{"id":"697092175","name":"Mohammadi Kakal"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"1108385601","name":"Marvi Jatoi"},{"id":"509507958","name":"Omair Ahmed"},{"id":"777621756","name":"Masooma Dharamsey"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1288336373","name":"Muffi Halai"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Thought i would write about my experience. Ordered buffalo wings for starters, which were fine , but the ones at Arizona grill are better. Then ordered a steak for myself and a steak for my wife. Both came out really cold so asked for them to be warmed up. After 10 mins my wife\u0027s steak came out, Luke warm, she ate it anyways. My wife is a slow eater but she had finished her meal before my meal even came back. After it did come back the steak was hot but overdone. I thought I\u0027d eat it anyway as I was hungry and didn\u0027t have much time. So when the bill came I asked to speak to the owner as I was not happy with my experience. If my wife and I go to a restaurant together we expect to eat together. He refused to see me and said he was too busy. So I paid the bill and went outside where he was greeting customers and taking bookings for that evening. I asked again if I could speak to him and he again said \"I\u0027m too busy\" so I asked him if he really wanted me to discuss my experience at his restaurant infront of his customers who are waiting for a table and he replied \"do what you want\"\n\nNow I live in England and this sort of customer service would not suffice. The restaurant would fail for sure. I have been to many other restaurants in karachi and the customer service has been great. It\u0027s a shame that this owner cannot see that keeping his customers happy at the early stages of his restaurant is vital. I hope he learns from his mistakes as the actual deco of the place is nice and the menu (on paper) looks good. The owner is very friendly when taking your booking but when he\u0027s taken your money he turns rather obnoxious. In the end I got a very sarcastic \"I\u0027m sorry I ruined your day\"\n\nNot great","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-24T04:58:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-25T12:29:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"688040667","name":"Farahnaz Haider Shaikh"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"603100292","name":"Abbas Bootwala"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"502247733","name":"Fouzia Oza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAyMjQ3NzMz","before":"NTAxNDE1NzE2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"403169863067503","from":{"name":"Farah Faraz","id":"697141034"},"message":"THAT is sad :S i was so hoping to go check out the new gunsmoke...but all i keep reading are these negative reviews :(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T05:11:25+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403183473066142","from":{"name":"Irum Ali","id":"100000226398562"},"message":"Kamran Sheikh...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T06:06:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"543024961","name":"Kamran Sheikh","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"403185403065949","from":{"name":"Masooma Dharamsey","id":"777621756"},"message":"I was going to check it out too, but I think I\u0027ll wait till I hear something positive about this place.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T06:13:20+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403190023065487","from":{"name":"Danish Raza","id":"578840177"},"message":"i was going to check it out today, now ive got doubts.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T06:31:07+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403190586398764","from":{"name":"Farah S.

When we finished two waiters descended upon our table and in seconds cleared it and we asked the leftovers to be packed. This is when we realized we did not have a car outside and called for it. In this time we thought we would have dessert. Upon our asking the server for the dessert menu we were handed the \u0027bill\u0027 again and told by the server \u0027I am not telling u but requesting you to pay the bill and leave\u0027 in these exact words. Now what do u think of that? When we said since we were not freeloaders and wanted the dessert menu we were told \u0027sorry but I cannot give that. To you\u0027.
