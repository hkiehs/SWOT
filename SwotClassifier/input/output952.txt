Went to Olivetto for the first time on the recommendations of the SWOT\u0027ties, thank you guys. From the moment we walked into Olivetto we were greeted by the General Manageress, who personally looked after us through out our dinner with her very well trained staff with proper etiquette, been analyzing the service industry for sometime now, and I have never come across such immaculate service, the ambiance was totally in contrast with the theme of the restaurant  which portrayed a serene dinning experience. The starters especially their tomato soup was divine, never had such tasty tomato soup ever. Every dish in the main course lived up to the expectation from the place, the steaks, the fish, pasta, and the chicken were all mouth watering delicious. Sorry, Afroze forgot to take down the names of the dishes from your staff. The TAT (turn around time) was exceptional, we ordered the food at 9:40, and within 7 minutes we were served with the starters, the time difference between each course was remarkably exceptional with everyone being served their respective dishes simultaneously. \nIf I were to rate the three factors of the dinning experience which are Ambiance, service and food, it is very difficult to figure which one gets the highest ranking, the entire service delivery commitment perfectly were in sync and complimented each other. Rating on the scale I would give Olivetto experience a delightful one which is the highest on the Likert scale of rating service providers. I would also like to personally thank Afroze Khan for making it the best dinning experience in Karachi. Value for money exceptional. Wish Olivetto all the success in their business.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-21T18:52:31+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-22T16:40:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"},{"id":"1640895663","name":"Javaria Javed"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"711344798","name":"Wajeeha Zaidi"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjkzNTk4MzU0","before":"MTAwMDAwMjQ1MDc0MTk1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"300803769970780","from":{"name":"Rehan Shakur","id":"100000128733524"},"message":"Here you go...\n\n        2 tenderloin steaks with baked potato and sauteed vegetables\n        1 Spicy hummor fish\n        1 pan seared becti\n        1 penne al Arrabiata\n        1 Olivetto special pasta\n        1 pizza Margherita\n        1 Moroccan chicken\n\n        The desserts were 2 Italian bread puddings and 1 Belgian chocolate brownie [:-)]\n\n        I hope you all enjoyed your evening.
