So when I remembered that Noodle House had opened and people had highly recommended the Wasabi Prawns, I decided it was time to try them. Just picked up a take out order and was efficiently helped by two young ladies who were stationed at the hostess station at the front of the restaurant. Was not surprised at the pricing because that was another thing that the reviews had highlighted ... Noodle House wasn\u0027t gonna come cheap! Still, I got the larger sized Wasabi Prawns that ended up close to Rs. 1200 for 8 (including tax).\n\nNow to the food. First, the size of the prawns was quite impressive with my mother-in-law exclaiming out loud when she tried one! The prawns were cooked perfectly and served on a light bed of salad with some corn. To be honest, I did enjoy them but they were not something that I would be running back to anytime soon. Maybe the problem is that the reviews that I had read led me to expect too much ... or my palate isn\u0027t as sophisticated as the rest! I wasn\u0027t blown away even though I have to give great appreciation for food quality.\n\nStill, I do want to give Noodle House food a try in the future. There are things on the menu that could be interesting and hopefully I will feel more positively about the food ... for now, it was good but not great!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-20T10:56:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-20T12:35:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"1626883423","name":"Fatema Murtaza Lacewala"},{"id":"504319826","name":"Sarah Masood"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"864470709","name":"Syed Muhammad Taha Askari"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"514492150","name":"Syed Adeel Rizvi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"MTAwMDAxNDU2MDU5MDk1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"543909692326852","from":{"name":"Salik Sajid","id":"512577683"},"message":"wasabi prawns with corns?.... those yellow pieces r bell peppers/capsicum","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-20T11:07:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543910075660147","from":{"name":"Syed Adeel Rizvi","id":"514492150"},"message":"I\u0027m hungry now!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-20T11:09:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543930098991478","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"I could be wrong about the corn, but I didn\u0027t think it was bell pepper!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-20T12:33:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543930555658099","from":{"name":"Salik Sajid","id":"512577683"},"message":"even at first i thought those were corns coz of yellow square small pieces same as corn size","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-20T12:34:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543931052324716","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Fair enough!
