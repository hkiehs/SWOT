Reasons being that the burger was toooo dry! i feel the patty lacked flavour....and so did the burger ofcourse! excitement evaporated in milliseconds. probably expected a lot! dont plan to visit again if that is what their ever famous whoppers taste like","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-21T20:13:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-22T05:39:51+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"783958571","name":"Rabia Rajput"},{"id":"723005353","name":"Ahsan Bham"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"652568733","name":"Humair Abubaker"},{"id":"100006520807699","name":"Naina Rehman"},{"id":"100000249741337","name":"Saboor Arshad"},{"id":"1669415344","name":"Emil Farooq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTY2OTQxNTM0NA\u003d\u003d","before":"NTY0OTg1NDgy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"637849439599543","from":{"name":"Ammar Habib Khan","id":"685505866"},"message":"and that\u0027s what one gets in less than 30 seconds!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-21T20:31:28+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637850686266085","from":{"name":"Muhammad Talal Arif","id":"636689899"},"message":"try any if you get a mufta,","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-21T20:35:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637857936265360","from":{"name":"Mohammad Ismail Asif","id":"697750147"},"message":"I wonder where did you read positive reviews of BK :/","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-21T20:58:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637882012929619","from":{"name":"Maham Unnar","id":"100000630261886"},"message":"no one has givn positive reviews for BK so far ..

Here is a summary of my experience.\nI have been there many times and every time I loved the experience , this time I was little disappointed ! Ordered decked beef , which was good. Ambience was good with candle lights and good music. Service was horrible! And crowd was quite different from the usual decent crowd. ( can\u0027t get into more details about the crowd as it might offend lot of ppl) my friends had made certain surprises about the cake which the management messed up big time. My best friend wanted it to be a surprise , but even one hour of dinner they dint bring the cake and then eventually she had to ask the waiter in front of me about the cake . Which obviously ruined her surprise!
