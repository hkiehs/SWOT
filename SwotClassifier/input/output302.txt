Went to Riverwood cafe today with a gathering, the first thing that ticked me off was the rule that everyone of us had to order drinks just to sit there. But fair enough. The thing that got me fumed up was a 500 rupee surcharge on the bill, written with a pen, besides the usual 200 rupee service charge as eidhi. Are you freakin kidding me? They expect us to spend 800 rupee on an overpriced shisha, 200 rupee service charge, along with 50% of the original amount as eidhi? We refused to pay outright, the manager did make a spoiled face when we were leaving, but this is downright derogatory. They expect people who come to these cafes to pay 500 rupee by unfairly slapping this exhobarant amount on the bill, and pressuring them to pay just to save face and embarrassment. Well F this, no wonder I hate going to these cafes.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-10T18:32:50+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-11T18:45:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100004544739993","name":"Anum Shafi"},{"id":"520882045","name":"Ghulam Ali"},{"id":"568861941","name":"Hassan Ahmed"},{"id":"730908290","name":"Aymen Jaffry"},{"id":"702370731","name":"Danyal Murtaza"},{"id":"100001089240373","name":"Abdul Basit Sivany"},{"id":"508588993","name":"Saroasha Eng"},{"id":"100001535796394","name":"Muhammad Ali Khan"},{"id":"508081630","name":"Maha Anwar"},{"id":"510429530","name":"Mustafa Tai"},{"id":"673567501","name":"Haris Hassan"},{"id":"607378917","name":"Shah Jamal"},{"id":"850785116","name":"Iruj Khawaja"},{"id":"1784225285","name":"Syeda Batool Naqvi"},{"id":"534115724","name":"Fatima Effendi Kanwar"},{"id":"701998125","name":"Sanoober Roohi"},{"id":"841710245","name":"Fatima Imran Malik"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1373971643","name":"Muzammil Jawaid"},{"id":"659370395","name":"M Areeb Rehman"},{"id":"100005181698422","name":"Sara Farooq"},{"id":"571807512","name":"Sumaiya Iftekhar"},{"id":"821415242","name":"Azhar Husain Zeeshan"},{"id":"626141022","name":"Ahmed Abid"},{"id":"561712779","name":"Syed Zohaib Hussain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTYxNzEyNzc5","before":"MTAwMDA0NTQ0NzM5OTkz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_601263149924839/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201\u0026limit\u003d25\u0026after\u003dNTYxNzEyNzc5"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"601263723258115","from":{"name":"Syed Mohammad Salman Husain","id":"590347699"},"message":"Plus still us receiving Eidi in 100s.. :/","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T18:35:08+0000","like_count":14,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601266059924548","from":{"name":"Zain Hasan","id":"100000234977922"},"message":"this is too much lol, its not eiddi, tell them to rename it \"Bhaata\"","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T18:42:56+0000","like_count":32,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601269079924246","from":{"name":"Nisa Ali","id":"564985482"},"message":"Weird!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T18:51:37+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601270733257414","from":{"name":"Fahad Hanif","id":"625571272"},"message":"quite surprising, utter non sense ,,,","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T18:56:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601275423256945","from":{"name":"Hasnain Jafri","id":"554510485"},"message":"Isnt Sheesha banned?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T19:11:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601275549923599","from":{"name":"Najm Ahmed","id":"885480695"},"message":"lol its one thing politely asking for eidhi, its another to add it as a surcharge on your bill and demand it from you.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T19:12:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601291653255322","from":{"name":"Abdul Hafeez","id":"773317577"},"message":"Just read on another page regarding minimum order placement limit, now this nonsense!

I just had dinner at Gon pacci too, with family. And honestly their service was PATHETIC! Firstly, we were told that our order will come in 15 minutes, instead it took 45 minutes for our order to come. And then when the food was served, it was COLD! Everything was cold. Also, we had ordered tarragon chicken, and as I\u0027m a HUGE tarragon chicken lover, it\u0027s suppose to have thick sauce, and it was not thick AT ALL and had very little sauce. Secondly, they didn\u0027t serve us our drinks, I think they forgot or something, and when we called the waiter and asked him for the drinks he said \u0027arahi hain\u0027, after a while, the waiter showed up with ONE pepsi in his hand.. when we asked him where are the rest of the drinks he said \u0027arahi hain\u0027.. a few minutes later he came with another drink.. again, just one drink, AGAIN! My dad got furious and sent it back. 5 people shared one can of pepsi.. IT WAS SO ANNOYING. I can never have food at a restaurant without pepsi! There was just one waiter serving the whole floor, I get that it\u0027s eid and all but if they are low on staff the least they could do is close one of the floors..  I could even hear other people getting all angry and cancelling their orders. \nWe actually went to have drinks when we left the restaurant..
