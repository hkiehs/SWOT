The menu had reshmi kabab, malai chicken tikka boti, qorma, chicken biryani, gajar ka halwa, crispy fish fillets, a long variety of different type of salads, coke, tea, coffee, chocolate ice cream, garlic naans, paan, kunna, soup and one more dish (i forgot its name).\nthe crispy fish fillets was amazingly delicious \u003c3 they were being fried at the spot and were being served pretty hot and were super crispy. this was one of the items which is completely finished. \nThe reshmi kabab and malai tikka boti was the best i ever had. it had that melting in your mouth\u0027 material\nthis biryani was spot on. \ndidnt tried the qorma, gajar ka halwa or garlic naan but people loved it.\nthe ice cream was the BEST. it had a generous amount of big chocolate pieces. \nEverything was just awesome. all the guests appreciated me on the menu selection. So if you are going to have your big day then Sadabahar is the place the deco and food was just amazing. plus i went for the low lighting effect. the spot lights were on stage ONLY because of the photography. rest of the venue was lit by those small chili lights on the plants, side table lamps and candles.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-30T23:05:28+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-31T19:15:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003375958106","name":"Hasan Allawala"},{"id":"581741209","name":"Madiha Rizwan"},{"id":"100001577208784","name":"Shahzad Shahab"},{"id":"595546010","name":"Hira Ahmad"},{"id":"13618530","name":"Omair Allawala"},{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"1037027238","name":"Bilal Idrees Allawala"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"1819660555","name":"Mahnoor Allawala"},{"id":"100005302207877","name":"Hira ShAh"},{"id":"829254501","name":"Kamran Anwer"},{"id":"100000046931487","name":"Rida Ahmed"},{"id":"1071310147","name":"Nabeel Irshad"},{"id":"641324643","name":"Nadia Moqeet"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"1041287827","name":"Naeem Allawala"},{"id":"685460614","name":"Nida Sattar-Saad"},{"id":"626070061","name":"Salman Aly"},{"id":"1574471223","name":"Zareen K.
