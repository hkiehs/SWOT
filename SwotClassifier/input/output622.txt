My cousin Zoya Khan and I were shopping in the area and suddenly realised we were just 10mins off iftari time. The chat place was the only place that we liked from the other eateries in the neighbourhood, and also was not looking for a heavy iftari. So we walked in asked if they could accommodate us, they said yes but since all the waiters were also Muslim there will be a slight delay in the food. But we were given the Iftar platter ie dates and water immediately. What put us off was that the place was under construction, with broken walls and area not cordoned off. And the service after the acceptable 15 mins was abysmal. The food was average. Worse was the attitude of the people managing the desk. And take outs. Some poor driver had been waiting over 30 mins for his order, and was not given an Iftar platter to open his roza, and they way he was spoken to was atrocious. Angry words loud ones were exchanged all while the customers were trying to open their roza.
