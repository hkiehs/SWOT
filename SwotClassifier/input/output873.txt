I very much remember the delay in your order and truly regret the delay. Please give us some time to sort out our kitchen logistics and order times. Since we opened so much \"restaurant wisdom\" has been shared with me from customers and other restaurant owners. 99% of this \"restaurant wisdom\" entails us compromising on quality and taste at some point, and I keep tossing the suggestions aside. Burger Inc. is not about running a chop shop and churning out burgers fast, it is about serving burger that our customers would truly appreciate. From the beef, to the cheese to the buns and veggies, we are hell bent on not compromising, and this is a big reason, along with a few others, why we are experiencing delays. We want you get a good product in return for your hard earned money, and as I see it the one thing we honestly need to improve is service times. I am NOT from the restaurant industry, I have no fancy chefs on board, yet by the grace of Allah we have been able to put forth a quality product, and I can only say that our service will soon also meet the same quality standards our food currently does. Please bear with us, I assure you Burger Inc. will there.
