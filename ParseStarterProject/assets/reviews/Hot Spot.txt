After a 5-10 minute wait, the order arrived. Lo and behold, it was a chocolate brownie! Upon inquiry, we were told, as if it was our first time eating bread pudding, that it only came in chocolate flavour! I told him that it was written on the menu board but instead of acquiescence, he told us that we should have asked him what was the flavour where as the menu clearly states vanilla. Anyway, I ordered an Oreo cheesecake which was Rs 20 cheaper, according to the owner. However it does not stop there; the owner was not giving me the 20 Rs!! Upon my continuous demand, he gave us the Rs20 and we, after being thoroughly argued with, walked out, disgruntled and extremely annoyed.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-25T17:05:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-27T10:42:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715326232","name":"Mazahir Noorani"},{"id":"577774492","name":"Osamah Nasir"},{"id":"1516952993","name":"Talha Iqbal"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"100003361185490","name":"Iram Faisal"},{"id":"511168242","name":"Akber Ali Khaliqdina"},{"id":"685460614","name":"Nida Sattar-Saad"},{"id":"1840274698","name":"Aasya Aamir"},{"id":"1317506386","name":"Faiza Anjum"},{"id":"867800502","name":"Hira Saiyed"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"510771592","name":"Syeda Shajia Raza"},{"id":"703984695","name":"Aliya Faizan"},{"id":"502280426","name":"Husnain Zahid"},{"id":"100002943458913","name":"Aisha Wali Muhammad"},{"id":"639117805","name":"Aamir Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjM5MTE3ODA1","before":"NzE1MzI2MjMy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"671992462851907","from":{"name":"Ammar Habib Khan","id":"685505866"},"message":"So relieved that you guys got your twenty rupees back.\n\nBtw -- it was twenty rupees cheaper, relative to what?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-25T18:12:09+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"671994669518353","from":{"name":"Aamir Ahmed","id":"639117805"},"message":"The previous dessert: 'bread pudding'","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-25T18:16:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"671995226184964","from":{"name":"Ammar Habib Khan","id":"685505866"},"message":"ok so you returned the pudding (or chocolate brownie), and got an Oreo cheesecake, which was twenty rupees cheaper?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-25T18:17:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"671995972851556","from":{"name":"Aamir Ahmed","id":"639117805"},"message":"And fyi it is not about the 20 Rs.

Had been there probably 10 yrs back. Hadn't returned coz the dessert then wasn't anything special. Sadly last night it was the same. Had the chocolate cupcake, nutella crepe and plain cold coffee. The crepe was generous in size and really filled with nutella so my daughter loved it. The cupcake came with piping hot chocolate icing which slid off on to the plate as the cupcake reached our table. Looked like it had been microed right there. My daughter finished off the icing but the cupcake was tasteless and so dry that she left it and I had to have water to make it go down my throat. The cold coffee was like having thick cold fresh milk with a touch of coffee essence. Also left that. Bland and tasteless again. Judging by the clientele, mostly teeny boppers, it seems that food isn't really a priority. The idea seems to be to be a place for young kids to hang out. The decor is fun and casual and I can imagine young people going there for fun not for the food. Don't want to risk trying any of their other desserts as it seems like they have the fancy names but no taste.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-10T06:33:32+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-10T08:36:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"422651261119363","from":{"name":"Luciferz Angel","id":"792470170"},"message":"I love their apple crumble, and their roast chicken sandwich in sun dried tomato bread (just ask them to go easy on the mayo & butter)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-10T06:52:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"422652644452558","from":{"name":"Lailabano Ibrahim","id":"1399965023"},"message":"Their ice reams are really good \nI only go there for that \nOtherwise their food isn't that good","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-10T07:01:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"422653974452425","from":{"name":"Bushra Joyo","id":"1421223164"},"message":"The last time I went there I had one of their burger's and chocolate brownie with Ice cream.
