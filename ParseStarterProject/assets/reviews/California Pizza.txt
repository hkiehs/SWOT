NYP and 14th Street have always been my favourites but seeing all those advertisements on the roads I decided to try out California Pizza this time.\n\nIt was visually appealing but later on I realised that it was not 'something' that I would like to eat next time. Who the hell makes a 'Paratha Pizza'?\n\nI guess I ruined the treat myself.\n\nIf anyone of you know California Pizza owners, tell them they should stop making paratha pizzas.\n\nI would give it a 3/10. And that even because it had 'some' taste.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-12T16:59:57+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-12T22:57:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000058392601","name":"Shauzab Murad"},{"id":"100000917370405","name":"Saad Aftab"},{"id":"100001262753914","name":"Musti Khan"},{"id":"513274653","name":"Amna Hussain"},{"id":"650618407","name":"Zeeshan Lakhani"},{"id":"1663385054","name":"Ashab Adeel"},{"id":"1056262977","name":"Umer Zahoor"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA1NjI2Mjk3Nw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTAwMDAwMDU4MzkyNjAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"665722220145598","from":{"name":"Ahmareen Bari","id":"756940336"},"message":"Tell me what your mom said to you?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T18:55:06+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665722733478880","from":{"name":"Sameer Mirjat","id":"515558572"},"message":"\"Was this your idea Sameer?\"","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T18:56:42+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665723820145438","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"Aur dow sasti treat, thora kharcha karna tha na :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T18:59:58+0000","like_count":11,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665723926812094","from":{"name":"Ahmareen Bari","id":"756940336"},"message":"She got class.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T19:00:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665724543478699","from":{"name":"Sameer Mirjat","id":"515558572"},"message":"Office k baad jitni energy bachti hai, yehi hota hai Ramlaj.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T19:02:28+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665724586812028","from":{"name":"Sameer Mirjat","id":"515558572"},"message":"Ramlah* :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T19:02:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665726140145206","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"Bss kar dai olivetto lai jata, walking distance hai :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T19:06:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665726426811844","from":{"name":"Sameer Mirjat","id":"515558572"},"message":"Next time apse le loun ga ideas maym saab? :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T19:07:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665730686811418","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"Good boy :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T19:23:15+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665733776811109","from":{"name":"Amna Hussain","id":"513274653"},"message":"Order from GD tomorrow, that will definitely make her happy!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T19:34:32+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665743553476798","from":{"name":"Marium Khan","id":"100007013108103"},"message":"strange..

Idealistically if everything goes smoothly in the phone there shouldn't be any problem with the delivery.

The guy taking the order informed us that the deals are only till 6:00 pm and they don't serve diet drinks. There was no point going on with the order any further. We ordered California Pizza instead and everyone loved it. with so many issues with MYOB, I think we will stick to Burger Shack and soon King of burgers, Burger King is coming so there is no question we will switch to that. Burger King has what every of its customer wants and they are so much more accommodating. Thats why these guys are so good.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-05T16:20:16+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-05T16:20:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"546027973","name":"Abdul Ahad Saud"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQ2MDI3OTcz","before":"NTQ2MDI3OTcz"}}},"restaurantName":"California Pizza"},{"id":"165861103465048_620260238025130","from":{"name":"Naeem Allawala","id":"1041287827"},"message":"Need good desert suppliers for California Pizza.

I have heard good about California as well and hope to try it soon with my family. In the meantime my words of praise for Pizza Point, I think theirs is a very good pie for excellent value of money. For the kids today who want to know how Pizza Hut tasted twenty-five years or so ago when they first came to Khi then Pizza Point is the answer.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-01T10:51:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"612627788788375","from":{"name":"DrSyed Farrukh Jamal","id":"749655321"},"message":"I've had the honour of being early customers of pizza hut when they opened at Bahadurabad in Karachi.\nCudn't agree with u more on the taste part !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-01T12:27:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjEyNjI3Nzg4Nzg4Mzc1","before":"NjExODQ0MTY1NTMzNDA0"}}},"restaurantName":"California Pizza"},{"id":"165861103465048_612284722156015","from":{"name":"Naeem Allawala","id":"1041287827"},"message":"RJs I need gd music for California Pizza.

We had to wait for around a quarter of an hour before any proper seating arrangements were given to us. I ordered a Cream Tikka Pizza based on the reviews i read on Swot. To my surprise they delivered it within 10 minutes and everything was perfect about it,Although my little brother felt that there were less topping of chicken pieces on it but i was completely satisfied by it. One thing which pissed me off was that all the bottles of sauces were uncapped. I called the waiter and asked him to bring new capped bottles and stopped him to takeaway those uncapped ones. Other than that everything was good and acceptable. \nI will rate the food 9 out of 10 and the place 2 out of 10\n\nPlus they need to focus more on hygiene .
