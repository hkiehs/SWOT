Aylanto (yeah it's alphabetical : P) because of freshness of ingredients. and best value for money in fine dining. \n2. BarBQ2night: for its (ISO certified) quality, consistency, cleanliness, & of course their German precision food engineering: P     \n3. CBG: oh this requires an academic thesis, or @least a drawing room discussion, a 1liner is not enough.\n4. Patio: cutesy, warm ambiance, gr8 food and different menu4a change. (no its not alphabetical ;P)\n5. Fujiyama: for the best Japanese in town\n6. Desi: best array of desi flavors under one roof, w/ the good looks & charms of a secret recipe, literally : P\n7. BOTS: best sea food variety under the blue sky, second only to the ocean : P\n8. Log Inn Lounge: for the best chill-out Drinks, food, & conversations on food and of course politics : P\n9. Cafe Gracias: for the best authentic Mexican in town! :P\n10. The upper crust: for having the best fro-yo, panini cheese steaks, belgian chocolate/ RVcake ever.        \n11. The Pakistani at Sheraton- great ambiance, attentive service, love the rose water scented pre-dining hand-rinsing, the post-dining paan and dessert trolley, and a wonderful way to impress family and friends visiting from Abroadzzz.\n12. Crescent Nimco in Bahadurabad- great samosas, chaats, jalebis, chai, kahva, and superb selection of nimco items to take home for when you are feeling like DIY-desi snacks.\n13. This is a tie between Tutti-Fruiti, for its unique self-serve experience and sugar fee varieties, and Berrylicious cuz they are simply sugary-sweet and opening up at Port Grand!\n14. Port Grand- clean and fun atmosphere, with smelly-free views of the harbor, nice walking and shopping, good security, and a decent variety of food for all budgets and tastes. Plus, this allows us to hoot and holler (yeah, i almost became a lawyer, like the loophole?) about Aylanto Bistro and Ghaffar Kabab Hoouse, even though the one in Delhi Mercantile is waaaaay better and more generous!\n15. Dynasty- best Chinese.\n16. Hot n Pepper on Bahria- best malai tikkah rolls. ever!\n17. Butlers- for their 'super-sexxxxy-mocha'- yes, you can go there and ask for it, it's basically extra chocolate syrup..\n18. Olivetto- where else can you get the options for fine-dining or lounge, both with excellent menus?\n19. Koel cafe- for their 'fire and ice' drink, which much like the owner, is the quntissential embodiment of Eastern elegance and taste, met with a certain Western and Worldly sophistication. \n20. The dark brown, unsliced, artisan breads at Hyperstar's bakery. their almond croissants (buttery croissants with actual almond paste inside) too, which are available every now and again on sundays.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-12T08:08:35+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-12T15:46:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"689771441","name":"Riffat Fawad Bukhari"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAyODQxNzU4","before":"NTgyOTYwNTc1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"396668170384339","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Fawad.  Buddy you complain about me to the admin yet you decide to launch a little opening salvo across my bows. Either you are an unrepentant child or you enjoy my jousting.
