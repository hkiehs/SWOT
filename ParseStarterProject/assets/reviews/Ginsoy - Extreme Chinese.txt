So, for 3 people, we ordered the following:\n\n* Chicken Corn Soup (I know, not many people order the classic Chicken Corn Soup, neither do we, but mother just insisted) - We ordered the large serving of the soup, and it was exactly 3 bowls of soup. No more, no less. Yes it was stated already in the menu that it serves 2-3 people, but the Ginsoy - Extreme Chinese fan in us thought there'd be more. Not at all a disappointment though, by any means. It was exactly what Chicken Corn Soup needs to be. Small little bits, but sufficient, of chicken, adequate amount of corn. The soup was just what it was supposed to be.\n\n* Wasabi Prawns for appetizers - The prawns were remarkably done. They had that wasabi-kick in them which was needed to give that \"buzz\" feel you want to have when eating a Wasabi Prawn. Yet again, there were 5 prawns in total, dot. Tastewise: Brilliant.\n\n* Fish Milano (my main) - Their Fish Milano was intended to be  a large fried fillet of fish placed delicately over a bed of green-herbs sauce and coated with cheese served with rice (as understood from the menu). It was exactly as described. I needed something cheesy and rich, and it definitely delivered. The fish was nicely done; flaky, properly fried, the type that just wants you to keep eating it. The green sauce under the fish was generous in quantity, but didn't quite have much of a \"burst of flavors\" that I was hoping for. But the cheese on top took care of that. All in all, a 7/10\n\n* Fish with Jalapeno *something*, mum's main (apologies for not remembering the complete name) - A similar sized fish to mine, fried as nicely as mine was, sat on the plate with sauteed vegetables, a serving of rice, and a small little bowl/cup containing the sauce for this dish. This sauce however, did have a distinctive taste to it. I actually borrowed some of it to use on my fish as well. The one thing common in the 2 mains was that the steamed rice that were served with them were simply the best ever steamed rice I've ever had in my life. The rice had an amazing feel to them in the mouth that is probably inexplicable, yet noticeable. An 7.5/10\n\n* Black Pepper Chicken and Garlic Rice, sold separately (father's main) - Hands down, the highlight of the day. Never have I tasted Black Pepper Chicken done so beautifully crafted in terms of flavor. And the Garlic Rice were \"actually\" Garlic Rice, not a joke in the name of garlic. You could just bring the bowl of rice close to your nostrils and know for a fact how nicely the garlic was incorporated in the rice. Father won, simple. Would definitely give 8.5/10\n\nWe ordered 3 drinks to go with the meal: Mint Julep, Blue Margarita, Peach *something*. In terms of the quantity of the drinks, father (Mint Julep) won again. Then mum (Peach *something) and then me. Again.\nThe experience, in terms of cozy sitting, soothing music being played in the background (rather than some pop/rap/hip-hop artist blaring) and most importantly, taste, was great. Definitely a place I'd go over and over again.\nThe only problem that I have is that the portions could be slightly bigger, because when you pay about Rs. 5000 for a meal of 3, you sort-of expect to be filled to the hilt. But it wasn't so. But it was 5000 bucks well-spent for taste. Definitely well-spent if \"taste\" was (and mostly, it is) meant to be the star. I would just say, if they could slightly beef up their quantity too, it'll do wonders.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-12T03:34:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-12T20:01:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1352533620","name":"Sakina Nanabhai"},{"id":"1088748635","name":"Aqsa Shah"},{"id":"1241948621","name":"Nayab Shakil"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"100002608457065","name":"Haroona Khawar"},{"id":"100001249191882","name":"Fozia Amjad"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"628495513","name":"Fariha Harris"},{"id":"617371190","name":"Samar Mughal"},{"id":"100001697508377","name":"Hira Qazi"},{"id":"550700453","name":"Ammar Amjad"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1202678003","name":"Aisha Naayaab Rao"},{"id":"614747510","name":"Tariq Hameed Siddiqui"},{"id":"100001419761223","name":"Imran Malik"},{"id":"756768261","name":"Muhammad Aslam"},{"id":"535065551","name":"Hassan Khan"},{"id":"789225723","name":"Lalarukh Khursheed Farooqui"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM4MjM2MTI1Ng\u003d\u003d","before":"NTA4OTIyNTA5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"648625911855229","from":{"name":"Sajjad Ahmed","id":"1382361256"},"message":"well described!thanks....but 5000 rupees too much!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-12T04:35:05+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"648630128521474","from":{"name":"Ehtesham Maqbool","id":"189100160"},"message":"Nice detailed review.

Despite the tardiness, food was piping hot. When food was taken out, steam rolled off the food & filled the room with aroma of Chinese cooking. And it was. As we ate it we kept turning to each other and saying things like \"wow, yum, mmm!\" The food was all fresh & spicy. Anyhow, I did not find the hot & sour soup (red) satisfying. Rest was excellent especially the American chopsuey. Check it out & enjoy!

However we'd like to clarify a couple of things. Firstly we are not in the market to compete with Ginsoy. We have no comparison with Ginsoy as they're serving Extreme Chinese and we're serving Hakka Chinese. Hakka Chinese is a distinct cuisine of Chine which is acquainting the market, at the moment. The names may be similar to our competitors but we're solely striving for our identity and not being a substitute for other eateries. The prices have been set to what matches our costing and market, nor an 'at par' comparison with Ginsoy. There is nothing 'wannabe' about it if our ambiance depicts the name we've given to our eatery. We're serving food to please customers like you and that would remain our first and foremost priority.

The disappointing part was the main course apparently the thai chow mien means a spicier version of Chinese chow mien. Than the real disappointment I am sure almost anyone been to Ginsoy must have had the cherry chilli chicken so I ordered it in RE as well there was no gravy it was fried dry chicken and instead of canned cherries or fresh cherries they had used the sugary type of cherries that you use in cakes which gave the whole dish a very weird sweetish kick. \n\nService was also good something Teamginsoy Ginsoy needs to take a lesson from as when in rush hours the service is not upto the mark.\n\nPricing was also similar to Ginsoy you can have half portions as well but that makes me question if I want Chinese why not go to Ginsoy ?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-28T09:40:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-29T14:52:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d","before":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"577638808953940","from":{"name":"Sana Abdullah","id":"627747302"},"message":"For service and ambiance.
