{"datums":[{"id":"165861103465048_681468538570966","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Brunch at Pantry today. Ordered the eggs benedict with turkey bacon and an Americano. The eggs were perfectly made, the turkey bacon was at the perfect crisp and while the muffin wasn't very English, it was the perfect thickness to mop up all that runny egg yolk and hollandaise.  Which there wasn't really much of, by the way. I wish there had been more of the sauce because it was delicious.\nThe pizza is always good there. No oiliness, fresh ingredients and served hot. \nThe Americano was just as it should be, and did the trick to wake me up. Strong, well-brewed and hallelujah, asked for skimmed milk, got skimmed milk. \nThe yogurt parfait really is all it's cracked up to be. Sweet, vanilla flavor, with crunchy oats sprinkled on top, nicely sized banana chunks, and apple slices all around. Yumyumyum.\nThe french toast was soft, fluffy, the maple syrup the perfect sweetness, and the chopped almonds a good contrast to the velvety softness of the french toast. \nSince there were a lot of us, there were burgers, masala omelets, pancakes, waffles, sweet potato fries and lots of coffee.\nEveryone came back happy and full. Pantry is defintely worth sacrificing a Sunday sleep-in for.","type":"status","created_time":"2014-01-12T09:45:03+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-12T09:52:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"100001631093382","name":"Aqsa Hasib"},{"id":"621305514","name":"Aniqa Imran"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"},{"id":"882410410","name":"Summiyah Malik"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"667511058","name":"Mohsin Makki"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"100000340437264","name":"Nida Khan"},{"id":"100000999733392","name":"Hadi Khan"},{"id":"508095472","name":"Natasha Mukarrm"},{"id":"524501080","name":"Zohaib Ali Memon"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Packed. And the same situation at Okra too. So, decided to go to Pantry as I have been hearing good things about it. They were able to seat us fortunately. Love how the place looks so bright during the day time. Since me and my friend were not very hungry, I ended up ordering, at the waiter's recommendation, a Chicken Acapulco sandwich while my friend ordered the Mushroom Mac and Cheese. I have never really like macaroni so the mac and cheese held no charm for me. I took a bite but as I said I have never been to keen on it, so for me it was quite meh. My guest was however pleased with her lunch. \n\nHaving said that, the sandwich very quite good. The bread is apparently baked in house and it is excellent. When ordering the sandwich, I was offered several choice of bread but I went with the plain one, which was excellent. Overall a good meal. Will probably go there again for dinner one of these days.\n\nLocation in the lane of Espresso Zamzama and Okra.\n\nExpect to pay about 1000-1500 a head.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-29T14:58:27+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-30T15:38:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1033177887","name":"Zainab Zeeshan Monnoo"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"622624323","name":"Mansoor Teli"},{"id":"100000434598020","name":"Sarah Atif"},{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"823205690","name":"Muhammad Umer Gill"},{"id":"690952546","name":"Shuja Muhammad"},{"id":"691430365","name":"Muhammad Ali Teli"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"1377186173","name":"Owais Mahmood"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"508776548","name":"Meher Saigol"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"1272243315","name":"Ambreen Shekhani"},{"id":"651643760","name":"Jasrah Mubarak"},{"id":"1471668943","name":"Aman Shaikh"},{"id":"805195531","name":"Amna Shah"},{"id":"100002154180249","name":"Afifa J Maniar"},{"id":"1277228905","name":"Rehan Ahmad Khan"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"100001773575512","name":"Little Chef"},{"id":"658210647","name":"Sania Saeed"},{"id":"724121365","name":"Rida Mansoor Teli"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4","before":"MTAzMzE3Nzg4Nw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"674220442629109","from":{"name":"Tehreem Fatima","id":"892195391"},"message":"u mean espresso zamzama! not shahbaz","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T15:04:09+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674220689295751","from":{"name":"Faisal Naseer","id":"780902784"},"message":"Yes I did Tehreem.

A lil Pizza with four choices of toppings. They offer wedges or a couple of Garlic breads. Not the supreme ones. No cheese. So kinda meh. And a drink. \n\nIll cut to the chase. Whattay Pizza!! \n\nCheesy, loaded with thick gooey rich sauce and near perfect fluffy crust with that crunch on the outer bits. The toppings were jus okay and not so evenly spread, but that meant more bites of that rich tomato sauce hidden under that thick cheese. Hell, skip the toppings n gimme a Margherita n Im a happy man!\n\nThis was fantastic.

I was a little off-put by the lighting.

I was like I will go ahead and give it a try at dinner time.. \n\n What had changed was the way we were approached.. The waiter introduced himself and was very polite and courteous.. he took our orders and within a few minutes we were served food! We ordered the sliders, burrito bowl and pasta... Which were all divine.. You have to try to Pink lemonade!\n\nAdditionally, there was a Christmas tree.. and while the christmas tree didn't look too christmas-y and more out of the meray beta school kyoon naheen ja sakta scenario (but i don't want to be the Pakistani who cannot be satisfied at anything ) hey its the thought that counts.. \n\nCongrats to Panty with the new manager in place who is obviously taking the place to new heights..

Dinner at Pantry over the weekend, and was surprised by the eclectic menu, quality of ingredients, and flavor of the meals served.\n\nOrdered the Gouda Burger, and after much hesitation, the Margherita Flat Bread.  The Gouda Burger was flavorful, and I was glad to finally find a good gourmet burger in the city.  \n\nThe Gouda accentuated the flavor of the tender, and juicy patty, while the condiments all complimented each other.  The Bun-Patty ratio was optimal, and the fresh texture of the bun made it all perfect.\n\nThe Margherita Flat Bread was exceptionally good.  The bread was baked well, and was topped with some good quality Margherita.  The flavor was light, and not overpowering -- enabling one to enjoy the flavor, without eating too much of bread.  Not exactly gourmet, but a perfect entree to munch on, during a casual dinner.\n\nPantry is a great addition to the dining scene in the city -- and one certainly hopes that quality remains impeccable.  Overall cost per head was PKR1500 (incl. drinks, meal, tips, etc.) -- which is a bit on the pricier end.\n\nHighly recommended for those looking for a not-so-usual menu, and flavorful food (at a price, though).\n\nOverall Rating -- 9/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-19T17:31:30+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-19T17:31:30+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"691430365","name":"Muhammad Ali Teli"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"1652751344","name":"Rameen Alvi"},{"id":"501776623","name":"Shayan Shabbir Lakdawalla"},{"id":"780560073","name":"Anita Zeeshan Al-Najjar"},{"id":"521961347","name":"Rabeet Ahsan"},{"id":"1137654497","name":"Maha Siddiqui"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5MjA0NTUy","before":"NjkxNDMwMzY1"}}},"restaurantName":"Pan"},{"id":"165861103465048_653790734672080","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Karachi is missing a proper Italian restaurant - at Zigolini's, Marriott Islamabad.

Kolachi has really awesome food and is THE restaurant experience in the Phase 8 strip, if not the whole of Karachi itself. I love the new first-come-first-serve system, now we don?t have to go back disappointed learning the whole place is booked. After waiting a mere 5 minutes for our table we got a nice table on the deck. We ordered Lahori Fish as starters and although I am not a seafood fan but those finger fish are something special. They were tangy, slightly crispy and the sauce given with them complimented the dish excellently. For the main course we ordered the Kolachi Special Steak (Chicken), Paneer Reshmi and Chicken Turkey sandwich. The Kolachi Special Steak in beef is my humble opinion the best steak available in Karachi and the chicken one has come to par with it. The Paneer Reshmi with garlic and roghni naan was a delight as ever, however for our own guilty indulgence we also had it with paratha. The Chicken Turkey sandwich was a light yet fulfilling meal and tasted as a sandwich, I?m glad they don?t overdo it or give a small sampling, they just provide with what is expected in a good sandwich. I ordered the blue margarita drink which I enjoyed with my steak. My diet conscious friends had lemongrass tea after the meal and according to them it helped settle down the food, however my greedy tastebuds would only go for a sweet dessert after a good meal. We ordered Zafran and Pista Kulfi and again, Kolachi did not disappoint by giving an authentic taste yet a familiar feeling to the food that just makes you fell in love with it. You guys must have guessed that we are fans of Kolachi (like so many other people who have no complains with the place).

First on the list was Fish hot and sour soup (white) which was the appetizer followed by the Dhaka finger fish the all time favorite, Jumbo prawn tempura and then the legendary Leather Jacket fillet in green masala, Fish Behari boti a new entrant as i had not tried it before, Pangush Boti Karahi,Chicken Fried Rice, Kids meal Crispy Chicken Burger Zinger,Garlic Nan, cold drinks and mineral water.\n\nOK, now for the mixed reviews i had been reading about Bots, well yes its has changed, it has evolved for the better and now is a proper food street fine dining dhaba style restaurant :)\nLimca stall was their earlier, now their a doc juice shop, i don't know the name of the doc but its good,dai bara stall and a pan stall plus loud music playing so the ambiance was definitely lively and more festive.\n\nNow coming to the revision in prices, yes their has been an slight increase in cost due to 16% GST but they are GST registered and the GST/SNTN is S3966140-7 and my bill had an addition of Rs.500, but rest assured it is being deposited in the national exchequer 100% which is cumulatively a substantial amount.\n\nThe real increase in prices is not that much considering they are delivering on quality and quantity, the fish was fresh, juicy, well marinated and had great flavor, as good as in the past if not better. The chatnis and the lemon add to the flavor too.\nThe service was quick and the food was served piping hot. Only one dish that was the Pangush Boti Karahi lacked flavor and was quite bland, i think that needs to be worked on and can improve with some minor adjustments.\n\nLadies and gentlemen Bots is known as the best seafood Dhabba in Karachi and upgraded its position now to a \"food street fine dining dhaba style restaurant\"\nnot a bad deal considering that a similar meal at a fine dining seafood joint would cost you 60% more with the frills and fancies, but as far as I am concerned the core issue is the product, and as long as I get value for money in terms of quality and quantity I am a happy camper indeed and plan to return to Bots soon for another round of scrumptious sea food delicacies.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-03T22:13:06+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-05T06:30:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"100000674735601","name":"Muhammad Patel"},{"id":"1004056348","name":"Zaryab Shaikh"},{"id":"100001433820134","name":"Hasan Raza"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"1413795365","name":"Hiba Jamali"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"521735682","name":"Aamir Shahnawaz"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"593601228","name":"Muhammad Saifullah"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100000446704703","name":"Almas Mehmood"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"564100900","name":"Fawad Hai"},{"id":"645099594","name":"Mujahid Iqbal"},{"id":"100002698452985","name":"Rabia Mahmood"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjk4NDUyOTg1","before":"MTE5ODgzMTM3Ng\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"644634672254353","from":{"name":"Mahad Mustafa","id":"805150435"},"message":"Syed Zulfiqar Ali Kazmi!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-03T22:58:39+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"585210551","name":"Syed Zulfiqar Ali Kazmi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":23}]},{"id":"644851935565960","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Oh I see it now.

Kept the temperature at medium welldone. This steak I had today at Monte Cristo just renewed my love for succulent beef fillets. Nothing seemed to be out of order. Everything done to perfection. The 2nd entre was Pan grilled snapper and boy they did it real good. Soft, chunky and grilled with care. The fiesta ended up on their delicious chocolate brownie sundae which again was not bad at all. Ambience is quite appealing with nice music, neat decor and clean silver and china. The place is a nice addition to Karachi's fine dining directory.

Enough praise has been bestowed upon it already, and the place certainly deserves it.  Sneaked in for breakfast, being welcomed by cheerful service, a cozy ambiance, and some good ol' retro music.\n\nThe breakfast menu is fairly limited, and straight forward.  Choice of eggs, Pancakes, and French Toast.  A no nonsense breakfast menu, without any fancy names, and complicated descriptions.\n\nThe Cheese & Mushroom omelette was cooked to perfection, with sufficient quantity of the named ingredients.  The omelette wasn't greasy at all, unlike that sexist place which serves omelettes practically cooked in diesel.  The hash browns had that perfect crisp, but were slightly greasy.\n\nThe Pancakes were delicious, golden brown, and perfectly unsticky.  The golden syrup complemented the flavor well.  Probably one of the better stack of pancakes available commercially in the city.\n\nThe apple juice was fresh, without any artificial flavors, or concentrated juices -- while the Cappuccino good enough to wake me up.\n\nOverall, a quick and flavorful breakfast experience.  Definitely ditching the overly pretentious Espresso, and everything-tastes-the-same Butler's for Rowtisserie.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-24T15:52:19+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-24T18:34:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"738981577","name":"Sohail Maskatiya"},{"id":"834880506","name":"Lalarukh Ejaz"},{"id":"575820034","name":"Maheen Kamran"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"506634707","name":"Iqra Anwar Shah"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"648091964","name":"Saba Sadia"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"100002937028856","name":"Mazhar Soni"},{"id":"48921867","name":"Anum Shahid-Ahmed"},{"id":"517470504","name":"Nida Ali"},{"id":"1424317236","name":"Anwer Jamal Chandna"},{"id":"669370980","name":"Mahnaz Laique"},{"id":"524665437","name":"Saher Najam"},{"id":"1023434284","name":"Areej Zahid"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"503116086","name":"Amina Tahir"},{"id":"1088748635","name":"Aqsa Shah"},{"id":"635810442","name":"Kiran Afzal"},{"id":"652430244","name":"Afira Faisal"},{"id":"504176735","name":"Ali Farookh Rizvi"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"755759618","name":"Aazar Ali"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NzM4OTgxNTc3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"639099519474535","from":{"name":"Nisa Ali","id":"564985482"},"message":"Agree with what u said abt pan cakes .

They simply forgot the sauce in the pizza (there was barely any), the pepperoni looked depressed, and the crust was the worst I've had in a while.  \n\nThe pizza represented something that one can get from a bakery, while shopping for eggs, and biscuits.  Disco bakery does a better pizza than what was delivered today.  I really enjoy the Pepperoni Pizza, but today it was horrendous.\n\nThe Cheese Calzone was excellent though.  Just the right quantum of marinara loaded with mozzarella.  Every bite was delicious, and if served hot can easily compete with the best ones globally.\n\nThe Pizza was a major disaster.

Early dinner at SattarBuksh with friends, and we were able to find space easily at 1930hrs.  Wanted to sit outside, but apparently, one requires to order Sheesha for that -- and none of us fancied smoking water.\n\nThe place suffers from an identity crisis, as it tries to make the traditional 'dhaba' feel more upscale.  The names of various items on the menu are well thought-out -- but it is really annoying to read Urdu in Roman Script.  Developing a menu purely in Urdu would have been an excellent initiative -- but I doubt majority of the patrons of the place would be comfortable with it.  The playlist of the place, was as confusing as the place itself.\n\nOrdered the 'Besharam Bun Kebab', and it was besharam, beghairat, and behooda at the same time.  It was completely bland, and as a friend remarked, \"it can serve as the perfect meal for someone who has just had Endoscopy, and needs to avoid food with spices, flavor, et al\".  Basically, a bun kebab for those who are unwell.  \n\nCan't really figure how difficult it is for SattarBuksh to prepare a decent bun kebab -- just hire the guy who stands opposite Uzma Arcade, and sell the PKR50 Anda Shami for PKR500.  Seriously, if people are willing to pay a top buck for the hospital burger -- they will be delighted to get some flavor with it as well.\n\nThe Roast Beef Burger was pretty much a disaster as well.  The meat was done well, but it was too damn salty.  All one could taste in the burger was salt, and nothing else.  Again -- these guys need to hire the guy who cooks the stuff at CHIPS and sells it for half the price.  If you're charging a top buck for a basic item, at least get the flavor right!\n\nThe Panini Sandwich was as dry as dust.  Nothing special about it.  Just a panini, and some dry chicken.  One can make a better Panini Sandwich at home at one-tenth the cost.  Again -- it had absolutely no flavor, only some chunks of chicken.\n\nI ordered an Iced Mocha, and that was the saving grace -- and it tasted perfect in that cheap IKEA glass.  The Apple Cinnamon tea also had a really nice fragrance, and was much better than other teas served in the city.  The mooch -- well, not really interested in a Movember moment.\n\nThe only good thing about the place is that it served Ben & Jerry's Strawberry Cheesecake Ice cream, which tastes awesome regardless of geographic location.\n\nA fancy place with an identity crisis, serving food straight from a hospital cafeteria.\n\nOverall Rating -- 5/10.\n\nP.S. Will go again, only for the Iced Mocha.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-03T20:59:31+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-04T16:41:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"841465178","name":"Sabika Raza"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"508081630","name":"Maha Anwar"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"593431153","name":"Rabia Aftab"},{"id":"838812489","name":"Saad Baig"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"559881298","name":"Nadia Mahasin"},{"id":"549655574","name":"Nazish Huda"},{"id":"100003573879421","name":"Samina Lotia"},{"id":"524535198","name":"Syed Sarmad Hasan"},{"id":"514440277","name":"M?ri?

We did not have to wait at all to get seated. The service was so swift that we were in and out of the cafe in an hour. We ordered Bhinnot bun kabab, Jheenga lala, Pasta Alfredo, Pepperoni pizza, meethi Lassi and fresh lime. Everything tasted absolutely delicious. I'm surprised you'd say that your bun kabab was tasteless, because my bun kabab was really flavourful and came with authentic bun kabab chutneys served on the side. The only minor complaints that we had were that the rice served with jheenga-lala were inadequate, and that the pizza could do a little better with a few more pepperoni slices. Other than these, my family of four loved the food and the experience.

Although it was not very much reshmi.\n\n*Brain masala was way too good and was also very nice looking, spices were balanced at least as per my taste but I was a bit sad to see the portion size, was recommended for 2 but was not even enough for 1.\n\n*Behari boti was below average in taste but the meat was well done. \n\n*Was surprised to see pathan style parathas, was expecting poori parathas (Bundoo Khan Style). This needs consideration at their end. \n\n*Lassi was good, but then no Lassi is bad to me so perhaps I may not be able to figure it out correctly :)\n\nService:\n \nThey were efficient, the food was on table with in the promised time, as such no issues noticed. \n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall it was an above avg or I think I can say a pleasant experience and I can definitely visit them again for the Sajji and Brain Masala !!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-29T01:06:43+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-30T21:17:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"100000501177768","name":"Mohsin Hasan"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"100006519972294","name":"Ali Raza Q"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDA2NTE5OTcyMjk0","before":"MTAwMDAwMzQ5ODA0NzU0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"625908250793662","from":{"name":"Yasir Abdullah","id":"716073180"},"message":"Share something about the charges","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-29T06:18:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626017687449385","from":{"name":"Sheikh Hasan Rasul","id":"522977702"},"message":"It was 4.5k for the above said.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-29T11:56:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626727227378431","from":{"name":"Sheikh Hasan Rasul","id":"522977702"},"message":"You're welcome Sajjad Diner : )","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T21:14:49+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100006692137726","name":"Sajjad Diner","type":"user","offset":15,"length":12}]},{"id":"626727720711715","from":{"name":"Tahir Rasul","id":"701976003"},"message":"^ Give me your laptop and watch when you explode.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T21:16:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626728720711615","from":{"name":"Sheikh Hasan Rasul","id":"522977702"},"message":"You won't be alive to use it either !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T21:17:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI2NzI4NzIwNzExNjE1","before":"NjI1OTA4MjUwNzkzNjYy"}}},"restaurantName":"Pan"},{"id":"165861103465048_626639384053882","from":{"name":"Syed Talha Izhar","id":"713665522"},"message":"After many years I got a free Sunday morning decided to goto BBQ Tonight for breakfast..

This is definitely something the management at BBQ Tonight can fix..\n\nComing to the main attraction food.. There was a good variety of almost every item one can think of in Karachi.. Omelettes, Pan Cakes with Maple, Chocolate, Strawberry Syrups and Honey, French Toast, Sarson ka Saag Makayi ki Roti, Sausages, Fried Fish, Halva Puri Tarkari and Chanay, Nihari, Fresh Fruits, Cereals, Variety of different bakery items like cake rusk and croissants, Salads, Lassi(Sweet and Salty Both), Coffee and Tea.. Milk(Hot and Cold), Fresh Dahee.. You name what you have tried for breakfast in Pakistan they had almost everything there.. \n\nWe had mixed reviews for almost everything.. Overall great value for money and everyone had something to eat.. Perfect place to take your family and no one would complain..\n\nPancakes and French Toast need to be improved ALOT..

Overall, Karachi does not have too many North Indian/Mughlai food places that are abundantly found in other parts of the world, especiialy UK, Europe, North America and the Middle East. Pakistani food is more onion/tomato based that is grounded in ghee for flavor whereas a lot of North Indian cuisine is texture-based and uses rich thickeners like fresh cream, dried fruit pastes and yogurt as well as pureed forms of vegetables i.e. spinach, palak, onions are usually pureed to create a thick aromatic curry. Some of the dishes you maybe able to find at Nawab would include Chicken Makhni (Indian style), Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Kashmiri, Mutton Roganjosh, Vegetable Makhni, Palak Paneer, Palak Kadai and Dal Makhni (with red beans: rajma) to name just a few. Also, at The Pakistani you can request the chef to make a dish of your choice that's not on the menu and usually he'll fix you something custom to your taste buds (esp if it's a weekday and there aren't too many people around). I so can relate to your craving for this genre of food; too bad the options are limited in Karachi on this one.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-27T18:46:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"625216677529486","from":{"name":"Saba Noor","id":"832395133"},"message":"Thank you so much babar ...

An ordinary one but less ordinary. more special in a way that it was filling.\n\nBacon Peperroni Jalapeno Pizza, 6/10 but upto the mark. maybe change the cheese topping. loved the crust though. fresh and crispy, this was a thin pan. \n\nTeriyaki Chicken, 5/10. big no from us. i think everyone just cannot do teriyaki. \n\nChicken Scallaponi, 8/10 this was my order. i dont remember much about this one, since i was busy tasting the others but i do remember that next time i goto monte cristo, i have to order one of these again.\n\nthe highlight of the night was the beef fillet, after such a long time, someone understood what medium rare is, and it was cooked to perfection. i was so happy to see it, that i forgot everything on the table. i found this to be so heavenly, i was almost envious why i did not order the fillet. Mushroom Sauce, impeccable. 9.5/10. perfectly seasoned, grilled, butter fried oh i want to have it right now !\n\nThanks Montecristo, i think we will become good friends. \n\nHaris Shaikh","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-25T06:30:55+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-26T11:26:29+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100006409002964","name":"Sirfraz Ali"},{"id":"530060365","name":"Abdul Wajid Qureshi"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"505552596","name":"Rabiya Anjum"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"558178102","name":"Safoora Fahad"},{"id":"569219957","name":"Naveed Ashraf"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"517470504","name":"Nida Ali"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"100003698171140","name":"Asra Mushtaq"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"642953122","name":"Amer Zahid"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"571357266","name":"Khurram Zameer"},{"id":"100001651622767","name":"Fatima Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNjUxNjIyNzY3","before":"MTAwMDA2NDA5MDAyOTY0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"624086504309170","from":{"name":"Umair Hassan","id":"755585401"},"message":"Fahad Farooq shayan ko dekha do yeh :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T07:36:50+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"577115473","name":"Fahad Farooq","type":"user","offset":0,"length":12}]},{"id":"624191927631961","from":{"name":"Sidra Khatri","id":"514359736"},"message":"lol we also went to Montecristo when we found Olivetto closed and recommended to many friends who also loved it... looks like Olivetto is giving away customers to Montecristo :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T13:32:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624214927629661","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"olivetto is closed on tuesdays","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T14:40:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624244844293336","from":{"name":"Anwer Jamal Chandna","id":"1424317236"},"message":"Haris Shaikh if you could pls name the items in the pictures for better understanding...though liked yr detailed review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T15:42:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624245077626646","from":{"name":"Haris Shaikh","id":"694723124"},"message":"Ok.

The pizza was loaded with all sort of assortments, putting Pizza Hut to shame.

There was just too much happening on the pizza, and the tabasco was overpowering.\n\nBeing a loyal Pizzo customer, the best combination to order from Pizzo is Pepperoni & Margherita.

Usually avoid going to the fancy restaurants offering desi cuisine because let's face it, we all love the roadside food regardless of its hygienic value. Anyhow, this place has really come out as a surprise ! Our order included the following:\n- Nihari\n- Biryani\n- Haleem\nThe Nihari is an absolute treat for the taste buds considering I personally am not a huge fam of Nihari. Desi makes its Nihari in Yakhni and it is the sort that you don't barf all day after having some. The quantity was good enough for 5 of us. It's slightly less thicker than we usually have everywhere else. The one DESI offers is light and tastes exceptionally good as compared to other Nihari walas around. Highly recommended !\n\nDesi's Biryani is something that I have not skipped in the last two visits to this place. Those who have tried it know it very well so won't go into the details. Great quantity and taste. Easily the best offered among other competing restaurants.\n\nThe Haleem *sigh*. I thought I'd never have Haleem anytime during the year except the Moharram season, but this was exquisite.

Well they said it for some reason surely.\n\nSattar Buksh with its catchy name and riding high on the internet media publicity and that too very creatively I have to give it to them the creativity behind SB is something out of your marketing text book. So the name is catchy it was very successful in creating the hype so how did it fare ? \n\nWell firstly the environment I would like the name of the interior designer and the architect it was so in sync with the name and the place. And they did a wonderful job and creating spaces where you don?t feel like you are all eating together with every other table in the house but rather how a caf? should be something espresso caf? and others could learn from. The flooring the walls the ceilings the artwork it isn't too much in your face yet not to subtle keeping it in line with the name. \nWell since it?s a caf? let me first talk about the chai and coffee. I think the elachi chai was amazing pretty good as good as the best chai dabas around in a comfortable environment but than again I don?t think I would be used to paying for 175 + tax for a mere cup of tea I mean you may have had it in your meetings in five star hotels but going for a casual cup of tea for 175+ is a big no no for me but heck I might go maybe but not for the tea probably for the coffee maybe because I love coffee more than my chai and they seriously did have pretty good coffee just the right temperature I had managed to try both hot and cold both were up to standard of your Gloria jeans or any other international coffee shop, priced similarly but I wouldn't go there in so much rush maybe when it dies down. \n\nHowever that is where it all goes downhill I seriously question if the idea is for  caf? or a restaurant because if they plan to make their earnings based on it being a restaurant with people occasionally ordering tea and coffee it is bound to fail they should immediately hire a new chef or something because the food is ridiculous no offence intended to anyone but the food was pathetic they don?t know how to make a pizza, a Panini in SB?s definition is a big fat loaf of bread with a bit of stuffing inside ( try butlers any given day and you will know what a Panini is ) butler is a nice example here they are not too fancy about their food but what they serve is pretty good. We were six people so I will tell the other four dishes the besharam burger again a very catchy name kudos to the guy who thought of it love the idea but the execution I have had burgers with sunny side up eggs in them but the chicken its bland no not just bland its pathetic to put it in your kitchen. Now the so called Bolognese roast burger seriously I know you guys want to be desi / angrez all at once and you have even kept the menu of bun kababs but this Bolognese burger was in the angrez section why did it taste like a bun kabab ? And not the good kind  either. Stuffed chicken penne pasta, admittedly the stuffed chicken was good but the pasta are you kidding I have made better pastas in my university days without even trying too hard. Stuffed Chicken with rice was nice because of one reason only was the chicken was the same as the pasta and that was nice. The waiter forgot our jeengalala dish which we thanked god for because after such disappointments I don?t think we could have bared another one. \n\nSheesha the only reason I mention sheesha in a separate section Is because I am big fan so I know what I am talking about well the sheeshas were nice very hygienic lots of options but 900+ tax for a sheesha I mean nowhere in Karachi have I had such an expensive sheesha. This is beyond expensive it?s a sheesha for gods sake the whole cost of making one is less than 100 rupees. Heck one whole sheesha itself costs you 3000 rupees 900+ tax for a sheesha is ridiculous Arabian or pink cadilac or for ppl of mohd ali good ol fakhir. \n\nService; well given the place was jam packed you could be forgiven for delay in service but what is unforgivable that the waiters don?t have a pen or pad to remember their orders I heard a few around me complaint about their orders and one of our dishes completely went missing when the food arrived.\n\nMy parting words I like what you are trying to do is a fusion between west and east, chai and coffee, burger and bunkabab but please change your food menu keep dishes on the light side rather than dishes with rice keep decent sandwiches nice pastas . Bring your price to a reasonable range because people might come for the hype but they need something else to come back for even those who have money to burn. But you never know Road Side caf? is still in business you might too with the same menu.As only SB can put it let me give it a try \" free advice hai leny hai tou lo warna tel lo \"","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-15T14:54:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T11:05:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"686500226","name":"Maira Uzair"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"61407780","name":"Zahrah Sehr Vayani"},{"id":"100000674735601","name":"Muhammad Patel"},{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"542900496","name":"Amal Anis Makda"},{"id":"1014345458","name":"Sadek Motiwala"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"630510285","name":"Azeem Afzal Motiwala"},{"id":"100003205271578","name":"Mahnoor Mukhtar"},{"id":"1292953231","name":"Aakash Kumar"},{"id":"597946799","name":"Alishba Shah"},{"id":"512868559","name":"Halima Sadia"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"701530707","name":"Zubia Ilyas"},{"id":"892195391","name":"Tehreem Fatima"},{"id":"647225359","name":"Sana Javeri"},{"id":"535320159","name":"Muhammad Saqib Khan"},{"id":"504319826","name":"Sarah Masood"},{"id":"1364547192","name":"Rabya Sultan"},{"id":"577409061","name":"Maaz Jamal"},{"id":"100003917951343","name":"Kiran Jabeen"},{"id":"672460650","name":"Yousuf Ali Sayeed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcyNDYwNjUw","before":"Njg2NTAwMjI2"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_619166518134502/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjcyNDYwNjUw"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619168601467627","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Omg...

And fell in loveee with the concept, the dauntless and audacious brand personality, the execution and the ambiance. Ordered their Besharam Topless Burger, naturally, and fell in love with that too ? sans the egg (don?t know if I intend the pun). Chose SB again this Saturday - a very special occasion - because I'd loved it that much the first time around. Upon arriving we could see that it was overcrowded and were told to wait for a bit, which was perfectly fine considering it was a Saturday night. \nI found it really sweet that the owner's family/acquaintances were helping him out with managing the overburdened situation. The owner himself was doing the rounds and serving people where needed. As our wait prolonged, we asked a lady who was helping out with the management if it was possible that we could place our order while we waited to be seated ? a query to which a simple yes or no answer could have sufficed. Her reply ?No we are not taking any orders. Please be patient? did not sit well with me; however, I let it go, attributing her biting tone and reply to the stressful situation that she was in.\n\nOnce seated we had to wait for a looooonnnngggggg time for the food to arrive. After an hour or so had passed, the same lady came by to ask us if ?everything was fine?. At which I told her that obviously it wasn?t since we had been waiting that long for a bun kebab and Panini ? an order which the waiter himself admitted doesn?t take longer than 10 minutes to prepare. She stated that the food ?would take long?; the frankness of the offered truth could have been appreciated if only she hadn?t added to my fianc? ?don?t look so unhappy, you WILL get food?.\n\nShortly after, we overheard the same lady asking this couple seated next to us if she could take an empty chair off their table. At which they told her they might need it later as they were expecting someone to join them. The lady unpleasantly started interrogating them about how many people they had said they wanted a table for when they had requested to be seated etc. \n\nWe had reached SB at 9.15 pm, and were finally served the bun kebab and Panini at 10.50 pm. The bun kebab was comparable to Roadside?s Dhaga Bun Kabab (which I LOVE), the Hunter Chicken Panini was quite frankly very disgusting and tasted (and smelled) of raw chicken. After we were done eating, I walked to the counter myself to get the bill as I wasn?t too keen on waiting further. The owner upon seeing this offered to get the bill over himself, which was considerate of him. Before he put the box in which the bill was encased down properly, he turned and walked off, sort of dropping the case onto the table.\n\nI didn?t mind the wait. I didn?t mind the bland and raw Panini. They are new and it was probably one of the first times they were handling such a constant influx of customers. They were understaffed. But none of these can be justification of being rude to a customer. Good and bad service notwithstanding, assuming a patronizing attitude can prove to be suicidal for a service oriented business. We went to buy ourselves dinner, we did not go to be preached a lesson of patience or to be treated like we were there for a freebie. To that hyper lady, I would only say that when I go to work every weekday morning, I leave my attitude and any delusional notions of the world revolving around me behind at home. I suggest she do the same. To the owner, I love your restaurant, I really do, but don?t see myself coming around anymore. Do remember that in this industry, the customer ought to be the king, so don?t please sit on that throne yourself.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-16T10:08:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-16T11:07:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"611865533","name":"Shayan Mehboob"},{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"614144691","name":"Saman Ishan"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"531056010","name":"Samreen Feroz"},{"id":"577409061","name":"Maaz Jamal"},{"id":"783794861","name":"Ayesha Oosman"},{"id":"712230730","name":"Hammad Ahmed"},{"id":"524665437","name":"Saher Najam"},{"id":"592929129","name":"Aqsa Jaliawala"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTkyOTI5MTI5","before":"NjExODY1NTMz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619549764762844","from":{"name":"Abdul Shakoor Motiwala","id":"590540852"},"message":"check my review i was there on Saturday too you are too kind with your words","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T10:27:23+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619553031429184","from":{"name":"Sheeza Ahmed","id":"552305433"},"message":"Its a pity, considering the energy-infused and refreshing menu that they have to offer.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T10:40:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619553401429147","from":{"name":"Samreen Feroz","id":"531056010"},"message":"Consistency is THE trait of a winner.

Then a few minutes later another lady came who was rather rude said, \"It will take 20 minutes.\" We told her that the other lady and waiter just said that they were arranging something. She again rudely said, \"no it will take 20 minutes. You can see if you want to wait.\" We did not appreciate the tone but we saw some friends on two tables that were placed right at the end of restaurant. Next to the door through which you get to the bathroom. So we went over to chit chat.\nThat lady came back to us in 5 minutes and very rudely said, \" Will you please settle down. I told you it will be twenty minutes. You are disturbing my customers. I need you all to settle down.\" This was highly offensive. We are a group of 30 year olds who were just chit chatting with some friends. Definitely not being rowdy and not getting in anyones way. The place which was quite loud itself, I'm sure a couple of voices did not raise the roof. The two tables were all our friends and the other tables were at a distance from us so I looked around to see who we were disturbing and surely no -one gave a darn about us being there. On her comment, I wanted to ask her, \" Do we not look like customers to you?\" But we even let that one go. \nMy husband asked if she could arrange 5 chairs around these two tables just because they were placed as such. She rudely said, \"No\". My husband suggested one small table could be accommodated there. She gave him the look of death like he had lost his mind. She again rudely said, \"NO. We can't pick up tables and move them around. You will just have to wait.\" I don't understand why that was so ridiculous as most places try to accommodate their customers by joining tables and chairs. Even then that could have been said nicely. Our friends started offering us seats to sit with them to which she very rudely said, \"I need you all to settle down. You can't wait here. You have to go outside and wait.\" It was like a teacher talking to a bunch of students like no one is allowed to stand in this place. Everyone must remain seated at all times. It was highly offensive. Again, if we were being rowdy, loud, or getting in anyones way I would have understood her annoyance. But this was ridiculous. Unfortunately, this was the final blow. We decided to leave. Even though by now she was getting some waiters to bring us some chairs but we had enough. Seeing us leave,  she again said, \"It will take twenty minutes\" to which my husband replied, \"No thanks but I just don't like your attitude.\" She was taken aback but continued to argue how there was no attitude. My husband said, \"It's still there.\" She just made a surprised face and then tried to apologize but one of those apologies,\" Im sorry if you thought I was rude!\"  Yeah sure, It was all in our minds! \n It was enough obnoxious behavior to last us for a while. Even though we were all excited to check out this new joint, don't think we are going back any time soon. Unfortunately, these joints should understand that nothing substitutes for good customer service.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T10:59:34+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619558464761974","from":{"name":"Parisa Siddiqi","id":"501377455"},"message":"Sorry for the super long post but still a bit frustrated about it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T11:00:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619559391428548","from":{"name":"Sheeza Ahmed","id":"552305433"},"message":"Hahahaha, sounds like that same woman :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T11:04:21+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619559401428547","from":{"name":"Samreen Feroz","id":"531056010"},"message":"You husband did the super right thing!.

To my surprise, in less than hour after I commented, I got a phonecall from a Food Panda manager by the name of Haya, who was very apologetic and sincere, and repeatedly said that she hoped I'd try Food Panda again and not have any complaints this time. I was pretty impressed by their diligence so today, I decided to give FP another chance. I ordered two sandwiches from Petaco's via FP, my total bill was Rs. 755. I gave the rider exactly Rs. 780, and instead of giving me Rs. 5 change, he asks for Rs. 50 more. I'm very dreamy-minded and tend to miss the obvious so I checked the bill, and asked why I had to give Rs. 50 more. The rider then says that those Rs. 50 charges are for HIS delivery. Like, I already paid Rs. 100 for delivery, but the rider gets a special Rs. 50 tip. I called up FP and they picked up after MUCH delay. Thankfully I wasn't passed from one rep to another, they were prompt in getting someone to talk to me and I explained what was going on. The rep apologized and said I didn't need to pay any more amount at all and he'd call the rider and speak to him. The rider didn't even return the Rs. 5 he owed me, btw. And I know the trolls will be commenting here saying its just Rs. 5, etc. but I'm more pissed off on an ethical level. This was my third time ordering from Food Panda and honestly, one or two hiccup here and there is normal, I've had them with Urbanite as well but this is just the limit! If anyone is thinking of trying out Food Panda, DON'T! At least Urbanite will respond to you and apologize and their bad hiccups happen once or twice. Food Panda hiccups with each order, and the severity of their problems only increases with each incident.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-12T16:07:07+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-14T21:11:29+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1324057559","name":"Safi Ahmed"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1497320748","name":"Fauzia Farhan Hashmat"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"507563555","name":"Sara Omran"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"783958571","name":"Rabia Rajput"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"1406140922","name":"Sufyan Khan"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"100004754324237","name":"Usman Kabir"},{"id":"554875549","name":"Imran Siddiqui"},{"id":"882650316","name":"Sabah Shaikh"},{"id":"100001565357082","name":"Sinan Charania"},{"id":"605974561","name":"Aneeba F.

A lot has already been written about Pizzo, and the praise is well-deserved.\n\nOrdered the 12\" Deep Pan Pepperoni Pizza, and it was a treat for our taste buds. A standard-issue classic Pepperoni Pizza without any useless assortments, with just the right quantity of Mozarella, and a crunchy crust. The crust is perhaps the best I've had in the city.\n\nPizzo just raises the bar high for Pizzas in the city, with competition mostly loading up Pizzas with irrelevant assortments, tomato sauce (instead of marinara), and cheap Mozarella. Pizzo is now my go-to delivery service.\n\nThe Spaghetti Bolognese was as feared, a disappointment. The spaghetti could have been just a tad-bit thicker, and the sauce lacked that kick, which makes the dish a classic.\n\nCustomer service is pretty decent, with the operator providing valuable suggestions -- while delivery took only 30min. With a per head cost of PKR500 (for 3 people, incl. tip), Pizzo served a flavorful meal without any random excuses or delays.\n\nRecommended for those who have a knack for Deep Pan Pizzas, and are tired of the ridiculously greasy NY Style Pizzas.\n\nOverall Rating -- 8.5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-27T00:07:20+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-29T20:35:13+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"522570731","name":"Hammad Ahmed Virk"},{"id":"1658686925","name":"Ali Charania"},{"id":"750380542","name":"Hina Shah"},{"id":"500778016","name":"Hammad Munir"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"609791225","name":"Afrah Jamal"},{"id":"505446215","name":"Junaid Siddiqui"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"860510556","name":"Sabeen Qamar"},{"id":"785615314","name":"Maleeha Jawaid"},{"id":"1346742308","name":"Ijlal Malik"},{"id":"803994779","name":"Shehryar Sheikh"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

I was really excited and oh well, i only WAS excited. Went with 2 friends, the place was pretty crowded and we were seated right away at the 1st floor (ambiance: 6/10).Turn off#1. I expected some complimentary bread basket etc but nothing. Found an exciting menu and that further ignited my appetite. Order 3 main courses and 2 drinks. Turn off #2. the waiter insisted to order their special beverages though we kindly refused about 4 times, eventually a shut up call was given. The food arrived within 30mins.\nTurn off#3. The chicken waffles were all about vegetables! Bland sauce, dry chicken, ordinary tarragons have more taste than this (5/10)\nTurn off#4. Burrito bowl, it looked like an absolute delight and all 3 of us attacked but Alas! it was a 'Chana Chaat Pulao' under the lettuce (it was hollow from the bottom). Its was beyond awful! Truly inedible, all the food was neither warm or cold, that was weird!\nTurn off#5. Mushroom Mac & Cheese, another bland dish, the cheese was all stiff from the top, stiff and kinda burnt pepperoni tiny bits, so the serving sizes were really disappointing.\nTurn off#6. The bill amounted to about 3k, since the experience was awful, with dissatisfied tummies,  it was pricey for me to pay 1k per head.\n\nNo offense but it was not my kind of a place. I'd still like to congratulate team pantry for putting in an effort, maybe I had a bad day since so many customers wouldn't have been there if it was that bad. I MIGHT visit again umm...err....if someone else pays ;)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-26T15:16:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-27T05:19:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"580737092","name":"Mansoor Badshah"},{"id":"680275533","name":"Sidra Munawwar"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"634991065","name":"Shazya Iftekhar"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"1412656399","name":"Tauseef Haider"},{"id":"517989587","name":"Alina Iftikhar"},{"id":"504513463","name":"Fariha A Farooqui"},{"id":"100002255823016","name":"Rafay Z.

Gulped it down with freshly squeezed lemonade. All in all I'd give Pantry a 9/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-25T10:10:01+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-25T20:31:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1652751344","name":"Rameen Alvi"},{"id":"1049298397","name":"Sadiya Naveed"},{"id":"1101865045","name":"Asma Bhatti"},{"id":"575220192","name":"Asad Ahmed Leghari"},{"id":"100001106314268","name":"Anum Riaz"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"100003863463567","name":"Sadaf Saad"},{"id":"687847728","name":"Ramsha Haider Qureshi"},{"id":"516333593","name":"Waqas Zia"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"671280076","name":"Samar Godil"},{"id":"100001562441083","name":"Nilam Jamil"},{"id":"790595152","name":"Mishmah Fazal"},{"id":"514147438","name":"Sulaim Nensey"},{"id":"787375286","name":"Zain Rauf"},{"id":"100003615698605","name":"Zahra Sami"},{"id":"517221007","name":"Sana Rashid"},{"id":"635343410","name":"Haroon Khan"},{"id":"617851264","name":"Qaisar Imtiaz Pirzada"},{"id":"660435505","name":"Sajjad Bin Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjYwNDM1NTA1","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"609375802446907","from":{"name":"??? ?????","id":"514472890"},"message":"Was it the bestest and was the food piping hot?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-25T12:06:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"609396562444831","from":{"name":"Arsalan Faruqi","id":"514399693"},"message":"Not exactly piping hot but sufficiently hot and taste was flawless","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-25T12:25:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"609597735758047","from":{"name":"Tahir Karimi","id":"667185780"},"message":"How much did it cost.?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-25T20:31:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA5NTk3NzM1NzU4MDQ3","before":"NjA5Mzc1ODAyNDQ2OTA3"}}},"restaurantName":"Pan"},{"id":"165861103465048_609350639116090","from":{"name":"Zahoor Ahmed","id":"100002653854221"},"message":"Romana Ahmad\n4 hours ago near Karachi\nHave had Cafeela 4 times in the past 2 weeks; have been regularly ordering in from them for a long time but usually for just weekday office lunches. Earlier this week I went with friends twice to the actual Shabaz outlet to eat, plus ordered in loads of food for the whole family a couple of days later so ended up trying more variety than usual (feedback on dishes below) - and everyone I have introduced to Cafeela has been seriously impressed, and wondering how they haven't discovered it before. The Sizzling bhindi, which has always been delicious (and more importantly light and healthy - as most bhindi dishes in Pakistan are cooked heavy on the oil), was even more so when we actually had it fresh and crispy in the restaurant on the sizzling hot plate. The Paneer tikka which has recently been introduced to the menu (after I've been pestering them for nearly a year to add it, as I love it as a dish and knew Cafeela's chef would do it well), was soft and flavoursome. Palak Paneer was packed full of taste, and as ever very light on the oil, my friends were raving about the Moong masoor daal and Anda ghotala, though didn't much care for the Daal chana fry (too oily). The Fish barbq boti is great (although on that dish I will say the pieces could be bigger), and Papaya salad and Thai beef salad (the latter they will substitute paneer for the beef if you're vegetarian) was better than at the Thai restaurants I've tried. As for chicken and meat dishes, I can't review them as I don't eat meat apart from seafood, but my fam / friends who tried those dishes really enjoyed them. Keep it up Cafeela team and Zahoor Ahmed!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-25T10:59:13+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-25T19:26:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"500778016","name":"Hammad Munir"},{"id":"724148371","name":"Rabia Hai"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"511882940","name":"Uzma B"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE5MjM1ODcz","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"609356849115469","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"One of the few places to get raving reviews from everyone.

There are four types of pizza.  The fancy ultra thin crust 'authentic' pizza baked in a brick oven, with some olives, and just a bit of rosemary on top.  The international franchise pizza, which is either loaded with oil, or majorly lacks consistency.  There is the me-too pizza.  And then there is Miss Hen, serving the classic desi-ized version of pizza, loaded with cheese and your choice of meat.  No nonsense.  Just a delicious pizza, probably the best around if one is looking for that greasy pizza full of flavor.  Lets call it the Johari Deep Pan.\n\nMost would not be aware of Miss Hen, unless they have spent some time at the IBA Main Campus, or live in NA-253.  The pizza just has insane amount of topping, and is full of flavor.  It may not be the most pleasant looking pizza, but tastes bloody amazing, and beats any of these available fancy pizzas by a mile, at a fraction of cost.\n\nHighly Recommended for those who are willing to experiment.\n\nOverall Rating -- 8.5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-13T20:54:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-14T12:55:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"777000220","name":"Ata Ur Rehman"},{"id":"513059748","name":"Tracy Roque"},{"id":"519570353","name":"Khushboo Zahra"},{"id":"100003533323814","name":"Sarah Muhammad"},{"id":"546027973","name":"Abdul Ahad Saud"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1547568629","name":"Danish Khan"},{"id":"100001177844959","name":"Sameer Siddiqui"},{"id":"838344921","name":"Wajeeh Hasan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"591166408","name":"Faisal M.

The server offered us a complimentary bowl of chicken corn soup for our 3 year old. Everything was perfectly seasoned, piping hot, juicy and succulent. Above all the service was outstanding!

With all the hype and good reviews we were expecting to be blown away by the food. Unfortunately the entire experience was just average. My husband and I were the first ones to reach so we asked the gentlemen who greeted us for a table of 6 plus a high chair and he was very sweet and arranged it all and got us seated within 5 minutes. When the other couples arrived we ordered the following. Burrito Bowl, Chicken with Waffles, Burger with Blue Cheese, Ceasar Salad, a pasta dish ( penne with an white alfredo-ish sauce), Thai red curry with rice, and two pizzas.. yes we overdid it a bit :).. All the food was ok EXCEPT... the burrito bowl. I hate using negative words for food but there is no other way to describe it.. it was horrible... The rice was under-flavored and kichdri textured, there was a thousand island like sauce on top which didn't belong and the worst part... there were mangoes..not the firm slightly tangy mangoes but soft mushy dessert type mangoes..ruined the taste...the famed pizza was deemed \"ok\" by those who had it.

With all the hype and good reviews we were expecting to be blown away by the food. Unfortunately the entire experience was just average. My husband and I were the first ones to reach so we asked the gentlemen who greeted us for a table of 6 plus a high chair and he was very sweet and arranged it all and got us seated within 5 minutes. When the other couples arrived we ordered the following. Burrito Bowl, Chicken with Waffles, Burger with Blue Cheese, Ceasar Salad, a pasta dish ( penne with an white alfredo-ish sauce), Thai red curry with rice, and two pizzas.. yes we overdid it a bit :).. All the food was ok EXCEPT... the burrito bowl. I hate using negative words for food but there is no other way to describe it.. it was horrible... The rice was under-flavored and kichdri textured, there was a thousand island like sauce on top which didn't belong and the worst part... there were mangoes..not the firm slightly tangy mangoes but soft mushy dessert type mangoes..ruined the taste...the famed pizza was deemed \"ok\" by those who had it. The service was a little slow in terms of the time between the mains and desserts even though we ordered dessert halfway trough to save time.We had the chocolate tart which was excellent as well as the Nutella Cake, and waffles..the tart was the highlight of the trip. There was nothing horribly wrong (expect the burrito bowl) but it was an average experience food wise for us. I would give it a 6.5/10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-05T03:23:13+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-06T10:33:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"676000707","name":"Tasneem Murtazaalibhai"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"735210388","name":"Sabeen Shahpur"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1441660053","name":"Humayun Asghar"},{"id":"100003533323814","name":"Sarah Muhammad"},{"id":"789430180","name":"Zehra Umair"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNTQ4OTcxNjE3","before":"Njc2MDAwNzA3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"598400670211087","from":{"name":"Sophia Bawany","id":"754555202"},"message":"Sorry forgot to mention .. we also ordered lettuce wraps and fries :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-05T03:44:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"598404400210714","from":{"name":"AhsEn AhmEd","id":"834360602"},"message":"","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-05T03:55:32+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"598405066877314","from":{"name":"Fiza Jawaid","id":"100002548971617"},"message":"You Know what by looking the length of your review i though it is about good experience :p Thanks for this information :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-05T03:59:30+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"598407446877076","from":{"name":"Sophia Bawany","id":"754555202"},"message":"Fiza.. it wasnt bad at all.. but it didnt live up the hype taste wise :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-05T04:08:28+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"598415406876280","from":{"name":"Fiza Jawaid","id":"100002548971617"},"message":"yes and when it comes to your money than you have to keep such things in your mind :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-05T04:39:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"598418743542613","from":{"name":"Ali Raza Pir","id":"515674780"},"message":"Hype haha.

It was around 11pm so was quiet which was perfect as we wanted to be away from the maddening crowd. We ordered the Mushroon Chicken Waffles & Chicken Pizza. The Waffles were  a pleasant surprise and enjoyed the combination. Loved the sweet potato fries which I have never had in Pakistan. Have had it abroad. Chicken Pizza was light and crispy and just perfect for a late snack.... the dip with the waffles was finger licking also. Service was efficient except the server was confused about the dessert options so we sent him back to confirm after which we ordered the Chocolate Tart which was delicious as per my friends...I skipped the dessert :) ( I know, a sin but dessert is the original sin for me :)). Overall experience was 8/10 considering in the first visit it was 5 and that too because the owner had dropped by and got our feedback very keenly.

So yesterday I decided to give them a visit. And with no surprises, everything I heard was true. Endless variety of food including BBQ, Chinese, Handi, Afghani, Italian,etc. ,etc., and what not. Although, the differentiating factor which separates Kolachi from all other infinite menu list buffets in town, each and every item was fresh and scrumptious and hard to resist, making it impossible to taste all of them. Specialties being Prawn tempura, Malai Boti, Paneer Reshmi, OOzi and Karhai. These are items for which you definitely need reserve some space in your appetite. And what to say about desserts, simply divine and celestial.\nA few negligible cons, long ques on high running items but visible efforts by staff to manage the crowd.  Secondly, when I called them two days back to reserve the water front table, I was told that they are not making reservations. Therefore I made sure to reach max by 6:15 pm, and was told that all water front tables are already reserved!!!!! And lastly the sitting area in the lounge was very hot and dark and to make it worse, red dim light hanging over our head. \nAll in all, I would like to thank Kolachi for treating my taste buds although there is still room to improve their aesthetics.\nScore : 8.5 /10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-02T06:15:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-02T10:27:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"716476797","name":"Rania Jawaid"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"690005614","name":"Owais Asif"},{"id":"100000108654676","name":"Samia Hyder"},{"id":"100002991745435","name":"Asmma Omer Khan"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"1200204425","name":"Sana Zaidi"},{"id":"100003829944979","name":"Saba Farooq"},{"id":"660435505","name":"Sajjad Bin Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjYwNDM1NTA1","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"596871450364009","from":{"name":"Saad Ahmed Qureshi","id":"739137597"},"message":"thnx for the detailed review, its helpfull","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-02T10:27:53+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTk2ODcxNDUwMzY0MDA5","before":"NTk2ODcxNDUwMzY0MDA5"}}},"restaurantName":"Pan"},{"id":"165861103465048_596829747034846","from":{"name":"Masooma Zaidi","id":"1441824961"},"message":"Can anybody plz tell me the telephone number of Pani Puri House at Tariq Road...","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-02T07:42:45+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-02T07:42:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"535096000","name":"Momina Aslam"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTM1MDk2MDAw","before":"NTM1MDk2MDAw"}}},"restaurantName":"Pan"},{"id":"165861103465048_596484820402672","from":{"name":"Sanaa Zubairi","id":"711699788"},"message":"Went to the pantry for iftar today. Lovely little place! Didn't know they were closed before 7 because i was in the area around 5 and wanted to make reservations. Very helpful staff, they let me in and took down my reservation. Walked in at 7, place was filling up slowly. Iftar platter plus whatever you want to order, in my opinion, is a better idea then a fixed menu with limited dishes that might be too heavy for some to stomach post 15hr fast. Iftar platter had desi pakoras, light and oil free, big thick masala stuffed green peppers, DE-LISH and oil free, small bowl of bean mixture which i thought could use some tangy lemony dressing and bread with raw garlic and fresh tomatoes that was a bit on the soggy side. Big glasses of chilled rooh afza that hit the spot according to my friend.\nDinner was lettuce wraps,spaghetti carbonara, burrito bowl, and flat bread with shrimp and buffalo sauce. Wraps were light, spaghetti could use some herbs, more seasoning and definitely more parmesan! Flatbread was filling, cheesy but lacked the kick we were hoping to get from the buffalo sauce. Too full to hit the bigggg helping of the burrito bowl! Ended with mocha java chocolate pudding- nomnomnomnomnom! We wiped the serving dish clean!!\nLittle bit of tweeking needed on some items but will be going back for sure to try the rest of the menu.\nOnly downside, was a large family with rowdy kids in the smoking section. Made it very difficult for us to chit chat while they tried to keep kids from running up and down the stairs and stay away from the adults while they smoked in a booth. Why are you bringing kids to a smoking section when you don't want them inhaling second hand smoke???\nAnyhoo, made the best of it. Thank you Pantry staff, manager and owner for looking after us throughout :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-01T19:32:32+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-02T07:09:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"732365126","name":"Shehla Zuberi"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"1272243315","name":"Ambreen Shekhani"},{"id":"622624323","name":"Mansoor Teli"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Gave it another go a few evenings ago and tried their Gouda Burger (changed my order from sandwich to burger on asking the waiter for his recommendation - good waiter and good call).\n\nVery very good (albiet a bit on the heavy side). Generous beef patty (cooked med. rare), soft, juicy and succulent. Well seasoned.  Bun was fresh and the best part was that the salad inside the burger was fresh (rocket leaves being a welcome and interesting addition here). All in all a very satisfying meal. For a diff. tried their sweet potato french fries. Interesting, but contrasted a bit too much with the classic burger and fries taste. BTW, they have a a choice of fires, sweet potato fries or salad as an accompaniment  to the burger.\n\nOne of the best burgers I have had in a long time. Thanks Pantry, very satisfied, from wait staff, to service to food and very good general cleanliness and ambiance :-)\n\nJust as an aside, and hopefully a chance to improve, the reason I didnt enjoy my first vist was that we had ordered sandwiches and found the bread too thick cut, a bit stale and crumbly in texture plus the filling was not too generous).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-30T10:30:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-30T17:40:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"780381887","name":"Samar Husain"},{"id":"503116086","name":"Amina Tahir"},{"id":"1143951347","name":"Sabeen Rasool"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"1385439948","name":"Danesh F.Khambatta"},{"id":"696432032","name":"Samiullah Tariq"},{"id":"512577683","name":"Salik Sajid"},{"id":"738981577","name":"Sohail Maskatiya"},{"id":"100000696198876","name":"Zain Sheikh"},{"id":"100000085462282","name":"Darayus P.

The place is not very spacious and the menu is limited. However the staff is very courteous and the owner/manager helped us select dishes and place our order. We ordered tomatoe soup, Mint and Pea soup, and some chicken strips (can't recall the name) as appetizers. The chicken appetizer was drenched in oil but the soups were creamy and seasoned to perfection. We absolutely loved our main course of BURRITO BOWL WITH MANGO SALSA and THAI CHICKEN CURRY. Both dishes were delicious, especially the Burrito bowl. My friend thought the Thai Chicken Curry was the bomb...lol. Lemonade drink was perfect too. We also ordered Mango Pavlova for dessert. It was a disappointment. The cream and mango slices were not chilled. Not the best choice, they have other options too. Overall it was a lovely experience and will surely visit again.

I went there with my friend Amna Hussain on 30th June on her recommendation specifically to eat burgers. We were served complimentary shots of some milkshake drink before the meal was served, which was very sweet of them. I ordered a burger with Mushrooms and a lemon mint drink, and my friend ordered a burger too. I have forgotten wat burger it was. The service was quick since the place was almost empty during maghrib time. As you can see in the pics, the presentation is very bad. They literally put a teaspoon of coleslaw in the corner. The fries were undercooked (kacha taste). The bun was of low quality, very local. The beef pattie was soft but again it was undercooked and almost had no salt (pheeka). The mushrooms were stale. I pulled out one from the burger to see if it was really a mushroom and not celery. The food overall had a raw taste. The cheese cake and drinks were ok.

By local I meant the bun they use in bun kababz that r locally served for much lesser price. If im paying 500 or 600 for a burger, I expect the bun not to crumble all over the plate. Question?where do these ppl at mc donalds get their bun from? It has a better taste and it doesnt crumble. Isn't good quality bun supposed to hold the burger togather?? 2. Stale tasting mushrooms like celery!! Well chef at Log Inn Lounge needs to answer this. They put the funny tasting mushrooms in there. I even asked my friend if they mentioned celery in the description of the burger on the menu card! They looked yellow and smelled weird. 3. I did not return the food coz I was exhausted at that time. Wanted to get back home asap and sleep. Complaining would have meant spending another 30 minutes there. I went back home and ate watever was in the fridge. 4. U are tagged coz in a previous post, someone commented on Pantry and called it a waste of money to which u had asked the person not to be evasive but explain why she didnt like pantry.

I went there with my friend Amna Hussain on 30th June on her recommendation specifically to eat burgers. We were served complimentary shots of some milkshake drink before the meal was served, which was very sweet of them. I ordered a burger with Mushrooms and a lemon mint drink, and my friend ordered a burger too. I have forgotten wat burger it was. The service was quick since the place was almost empty during maghrib time. As you can see in the pics, the presentation is very bad. They literally put a teaspoon of coleslaw in the corner. The fries were undercooked (kacha taste). The bun was of low quality, very local. The beef pattie was soft but again it was undercooked and almost had no salt (pheeka). The mushrooms were stale. I pulled out one from the burger to see if it was really a mushroom and not celery. The food overall had a raw taste. The cheese cake and drinks were ok. No plans of visiting LOG INN LOUNGE to eat burgers atleast ever.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-06T23:16:02+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-08T11:07:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"565340149","name":"Rabeeya Iftikhar"},{"id":"1256236750","name":"Muhammad Saad Khan"},{"id":"100005945647613","name":"Sara H Khan"},{"id":"844605276","name":"Salman Vidhani"},{"id":"649049339","name":"Basit Saeed"},{"id":"500907007","name":"Murtaza Moiz"},{"id":"1058171190","name":"Fahad-Pakistani Zaidi"},{"id":"660885104","name":"Junaid Mansoor Khan"},{"id":"1579891410","name":"Erum Siddiqui"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTU3OTg5MTQxMA\u003d\u003d","before":"NTY1MzQwMTQ5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"581556461895508","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"I don't remember asking at all.

Stale tasting mushrooms like celery!! Well chef at Log Inn Lounge needs to answer this. They put the funny tasting mushrooms in there. I even asked my friend if they mentioned celery in the description of the burger on the menu card! They looked yellow and smelled weird. 3. I did not return the food coz I was exhausted at that time. Wanted to get back home asap and sleep. Complaining would have meant spending another 30 minutes there. I went back home and ate watever was in the fridge. 4. U are tagged coz in a previous post, someone commented on Pantry and called it a waste of money to which u had asked the person not to be evasive but explain why she didnt like pantry.

By local I meant the bun they use in bun kababz that r locally served for much lesser price. If im paying 500 or 600 for a burger, I expect the bun not to crumble all over the plate. Question?where do these ppl at mc donalds get their bun from? It has a better taste and it doesnt crumble. Isn't good quality bun supposed to hold the burger togather?? 2. Stale tasting mushrooms like celery!! Well chef at Log Inn Lounge needs to answer this. They put the funny tasting mushrooms in there. I even asked my friend if they mentioned celery in the description of the burger on the menu card! They looked yellow and smelled weird. 3. I did not return the food coz I was exhausted at that time. Wanted to get back home asap and sleep. Complaining would have meant spending another 30 minutes there. I went back home and ate watever was in the fridge. 4. U are tagged coz in a previous post, someone commented on Pantry and called it a waste of money to which u had asked the person not to be evasive but explain why she didnt like pantry. I had done the same when I commented on a post about Log Inn Lounge. I wasn't clear. Since u r the admin, I thought it responsible to tag u coz I had not explained my experience and had just commented.

Log Inn has always had some of the best burgers in town, but maybe not everyone will like the texture and taste. And certainly one has to respect the opinion that you have put forward based on your experience. However, I do think that if you are going to complain or post in a public forum, you should at least have informed the restaurant when it happened and given them a chance to fix things. Anyone can have a bad moment and generally are happy to address customer concerns immediately. Posting negative comments here doesn't hurt them given the multitude of positive experiences and comments from others, but it does not seem fair given that they were never given the opportunity to address your concerns. Finally, it is good that details were given because now both the readers and the restaurant know what the issues were... posts without details don't allow anyone to truly understand what went on.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-07T05:00:05+0000","like_count":9,"user_likes":false},{"id":"581606461890508","from":{"name":"Ahmad Owais","id":"688715909"},"message":"Noone asking anyone to go there or forcing anyone to like the place :).

On top of that the order took ages to come which in the heat and constant flickering of electricity made the experience worst.

Not extraordinary, maybe even a little bland. \nWas looking forward to the egg rolls the most! The description immediately caught my eye and its been forever since I had a good egg roll. The filling was perfect! The avocado was a perfect addition to the classic egg roll BUT, and it is a big but, it was just toooo oily. Literally dripping with oil.

It was a nice enough place and the service was attentive. The food was a disappointment because it just didn't taste that good. There wasn't anything \"bad\" to say but it really was not comparable to what one expects at a good restaurant. The limited selection of chicken dishes was a problem for Mariyam Masood, and funnily enough, another couple walked out for the same reason after reviewing the menu. The appetizer of boneless chicken was bland without major amounts of dipping sauce and was pretty dried out & solid in consistency. My gouda burger was alright but there are plenty of significantly better burgers around. Mariyam's chicken sandwich in olive bread was similarly alright but she didn't particularly enjoy it. As I said, we didn't have anything \"bad\" to say about the food or the place, and service was prompt and good ... but it was not an experience that made us want to go back there unless we hear of major changes!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-25T15:12:17+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-27T08:34:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQwNjE5NTEw","before":"NTI1MzMxMjgx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"561982257186262","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"My experience of the Gouda Burger was good and I lived the Chocolate Tart.

Unfortunately, the good part almost ends here.. the turkey jalapeno pizza was served on a thin crust which suited us all just fine except for the topping didn't go down too well.. it was a bit bland for our liking. the Cajun Jambalaya was a huge disappointment, as one of the friends mentioned, it seemed like a desi version of regular pasta and the spice mix tasted almost like ghar ka salan, with coriander powder and chili flakes.. while the pasta was smeared in spice mix, the shrimps on the side were almost bland and not something we'd want served in a restaurant.. \nthe most commendable part of the evening however was when the owner paid a random visit at our table to get our feedback and when informed of our experience with the jambalaya, he admitted of receiving mixed reviews, graciously accepted the criticism with a smile, apologized instead of taking offence and offered us a serving each of two best seller desserts, on the house! a gesture very well appreciated by us all.. \nthe chocolate tart that he personally recommended was a tad bitter, he warned us before hand, but then most of us liked it just the way it was! the red velvet cheesecake was just about ok.. the cheese part was yummilicious however we found the crust to be way too hard. like he said, the choco tart is a definitely a must try at Pantry, so much so that a friend in the group proclaims to have gone off the cheesecakes in favor of those chocolate tarts! :-)\nwe wish the management all the best in keeping up their good food standards, the hygiene and well lit ambiance and hope they will overcome the minute glitches in no time..... hope to return back to the place soon!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-24T20:26:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-27T07:05:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575802952","name":"Ayesha Farooqi"},{"id":"764425006","name":"Alisa Zulfiqar Zuberi"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"1120122270","name":"Shehla Khurram"},{"id":"633230637","name":"Mahnaz Hadi"},{"id":"512577683","name":"Salik Sajid"},{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"100000125904027","name":"Samad Tariq"},{"id":"100004102427163","name":"Malyha Shuja"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"709896077","name":"Asma Asghar"},{"id":"1488375731","name":"Salim Khoonjee"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"785615314","name":"Maleeha Jawaid"},{"id":"100000554344923","name":"Salman Khan Nizari"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEyMDkxMjYx","before":"NTc1ODAyOTUy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"561593153891839","from":{"name":"Maleeha Jawaid","id":"785615314"},"message":"Oh wow.

Not being big eaters, yet wanting to try several items on the menu, we ended up ordering lettuce wraps as an appetizer ( excellent!), turkey jalape?o pizza ( just perfect), Gouda burger ( patty was grilled to perfection ) & chocolate tart (yummy!). We thought that there was no way that 2 people could do justice to this much food, but boy, oh boy, we ate almost all of it. The staff & owners were extremely attentive & courteous, the ambience simple yet appealing, the food impeccable. What I simply loved about this place was that they had many healthy options & variations.. For example you could get a fresh salad with the burger instead of fries, or have fresh fruit with granola & honey as a dessert. The salads were crisp & fresh & not drenched in dressing. The food quality indicated high quality ingredients. In all, I was thoroughly satisfied with my meal & given that they have an attractive children's & breakfast menu, and a non smoking area,  I will definitely be a frequent visitor at the Pantry.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-15T18:41:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-18T12:32:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"100000144649501","name":"Durray Sadaf"},{"id":"1268142470","name":"Monty Mashooqullah"},{"id":"684670075","name":"Maham T.

Nothing too fancy, yet nothing to casual, either. Ended up at the recently opened Cilantro, a hop, skip and a jump away from Pane and Amore (Love). Although I was a bit skeptical about trying out a new place, and that too because my dad read a review in this Sunday's DAWN (I was like, Abu, really? You want to try out a new place because of a newspaper ka review? Kisi se puch toh lein!). Khair, my Abu being my Abu, insisted we go there, so with some trepidation, I did. Little did I know, that I was entering a fun, colorful little joint with one wall filled with chefs from all over the world. Is it weird I knew half of them? And if the owners of Cilantro read this, please add Marco Pierre White's picture to the wall. Blasphemous he's not there. Thank you. On to the food. It's very rare when every single person likes and enjoys what they ordered. Now, if you know me, you know I tend to never, ever remember the proper names of things eaten. So please excuse that lapse of mine. Before we got our order, we got a complimentary pizza toast type thing, which at first glance seemed dubious regarding the taste, and I was afraid the toppings would make the toast itself soggy. We were pleasantly surprised to find it was quite delicious! The flavors of the tomato base, onions and green pepper on the crispy toasted bread coated with mozzarella was a beautiful combination. I ordered the calamari and prawn soup, which is not for those who like mild, flavorful soups. This was hot, like hot and sour soup hot, and as expected, frozen seafood tends to have that halkiii si smell. I must say though, that the prawn and calamari weren't too rubbery or overcooked (Y). Next up, as appetizers, we ordered Lunch on a Stick. While it may sound interesting, to say the least, it was deeelllliiicccious! Kind of like a desified version of a corn dog, with fries covered in garlic mayo, which was again, very good. Just the right kick off garlic and a hint of sour. Lunch on a Stick was served in a fry basket, and me being easy to entertain, found the curls of carrots on top really cute, and yummy to eat. The batter-fried chicken that comprised of our appetizer had a salsa verde type filling, and the batter itself wasn't bad at all. It wasn't the tempura batter at Sakura by any stretch, mind you, but had some crunch to it. I wouldn't mind having that as a midnight snack, to tell you the truth. My sister ordered the Caesar salad, which she enjoyed as well. I asked for the grilled chicken and mushroom spaghetti, which while it lacked salt, was beautifully done. Tender pieces of chicken flavored with tarragon, and a hint of spice to cut the richness of the white cream sauce. Once again, I had my entertaining carrot curls, which might bother some, but since I like my veggies, I ate them right along with my meal. My sister ordered a club sandwich, which she and Abu shared, and it looked mighty fine. Even Abu, fussy as he is about his club sandwiches, enjoyed it immensely. My brother in-law ordered a steak, the Americano, I believe, and since he wasn't talking while eating, I'm guessing he really liked it. Oh, and did I mention it was pink in the middle? The steak, not my brother in-law. From my limited knowledge, I could tell the steak had been grilled to perfection. My mother ordered the Hannah or Hannan chicken, not too sure, and she told me the sauce was jalapeno flavored, and she really liked her dinner too. I also asked for the mint lemonade, which was a refreshing change, since most places usually use 7 Up as the basis of their lemonade, this was closer to home, made in water and strong on the mint, which is how I love it. The service was bit slow, however. But I was expecting that since it's a relatively new place and as all businesses, will settle with time. Now, considering that two people from the six of us hadn't ordered any entree, the bill was phir bhi much, much lower than expected, and with the quality of the food, ambiance, and servings, unbelievably reasonable. After that, we couldn't resist Pane and Amore's cupcakes, could we? If we hadn't been so stuffed, I would have insisted we sit there and have a cup of coffee and share cupcakes. That still didn't stop me from taking a bite (Or 2) out of my peanut butter cupcake, which was just...I mean...I have no words. And I have more cupcake for me tomorrow! Yay!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-09T19:22:33+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-10T15:59:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"684094046","name":"Faiza Hasan"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

First of all, the size of the cupcake was on the small side so I wasn't too happy with that. Second of all, the cupcake part itself didn't have much of a taste or flavor at all. The red velvet tasted too much of baking soda or something like that and the vanilla cupcake was totally flavorless. The worst part was the icing! It was crunchy!! I could actually crunch on the sugar. I  like smooth, fluffy, creamy icings on my cupcakes not crunchy ones!

I had a major cupcake craving and so I was looking forward to some indulgence but sadly I was not impressed. I'm not a huge chocolate fan so I got a red velvet and a vanilla buttercream. First of all, the size of the cupcake was on the small side so I wasn't too happy with that. Second of all, the cupcake part itself didn't have much of a taste or flavor at all. The red velvet tasted too much of baking soda or something like that and the vanilla cupcake was totally flavorless. The worst part was the icing! It was crunchy!! I could actually crunch on the sugar. I  like smooth, fluffy, creamy icings on my cupcakes not crunchy ones!

Aman Virji and team will ensure that you leave with a satisfied tummy and a smile on your face. Impeccable service, world class hospitality, scrumptious food, this place is fine dining at its best. \n\nThe Thai Red Curry, although not spicy, was delicious. The quantity of rice should be equal to the curry but no complaints. However, not a big bringal fan. Will ask them not to add that next time. Not that it changed the flavor or anything. It tasted just like the TRC at Deli and Fuschia so I would give it a 7.5/10. Baan Thai still bags 9/10 as it is spicier.\n\nFriends liked their Beef Tenderloin with Dark Chocolate Reduction, Saffron Chicken and Pan Seared Seabass as well as their orange, grapefruit and apple juice. The Seabass was a sure fire hit! Aman was a gracious host and they gave the birthday girl a sweet surprise in form of a RVC slice...attention to detail: the knife had a pink ribbon too \u003c3 Thank you Forty4 for being oh-so-awesome and for making my birthday so special :)\n\nFor the second time around: HIGHLY recommended!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-01T17:06:04+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-07T15:25:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"},{"id":"681799779","name":"Ratan Salem"},{"id":"786945014","name":"Samia Chundrigar"},{"id":"504810399","name":"Zara Rehman"},{"id":"100000059823691","name":"Haroon Leghari"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"502191902","name":"Zaigham Hidayatullah"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"100003248183175","name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"100003672338905","name":"Umbreen Mahmood"},{"id":"509507958","name":"Omair Ahmed"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"871750088","name":"Adnan Rao"},{"id":"100001973577700","name":"Saad Asim"},{"id":"544715226","name":"Sairah Khalid"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQ1MzkwMTMxMw\u003d\u003d","before":"NTAxNDE1NzE2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"511764002208088","from":{"name":"Sairah Khalid","id":"544715226"},"message":"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HAJRA!\ni am soooo glad that forty4 made your special day more special.\nall the best :o)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-01T17:34:05+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"511788495538972","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Indeed, Forty4 is one of the best cafes in K-Town...

I am sure to most people who have been to ?44? can back me on saying that the place has ?ambiance?. Some aura in the air about it, that is almost indescribable about the ambiance. Its food and atmosphere can stand ?almost? toe to toe to the best out there in Karachi. \n\nWe contacted the semi owner of the place Mr. Aman on Monday about the party to be hosted tonight. He invited us over to discuss the menu on which we decided on a buffet menu as following: \nHot & Sour soup \nThai Chicken Salad\nPapaya Salad \nHoney glazed BBQ smoked wings\nPan fried Sea bass with lemon thyme sauce\nRed Thai chicken curry\nChili & Basil Beef\nFried Rice \nRed sauce pasta (simple pasta olives and vegetables)\nFudge cake. \n\nNow my family was a bit skeptical that a restaurant that is not used to serve buffet will be able to manage it. Well the food was amazing the Hot & Sour soup was different from the usual out there and tasteful. Pasta was ordinary but that was expected. Fish & the beef get a special mention because everyone raved about it. \nNow you must have noticed the ?almost? part in my heading. 44 lost out on two things one very small that is the refilling of the buffet was a bit slow but not so slow that you would cry over it. But the major disappointment was the dessert it was in fact what all our guests did actually complaint about, it was a huge disappointment it was dry, fudge was barely existent. And I really hope they improve on that part. All in all i would recommend the place but not for the dessert.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-31T11:24:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-02T10:14:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"871750088","name":"Adnan Rao"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"2320004","name":"Hassan Baweja"},{"id":"529620428","name":"Roomana Nasir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI5NjIwNDI4","before":"MTEzNTIzNjMzOQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"498497360201419","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Fair and thorough review.

The service was very prompt, friendly and attentive. But in terms of food, it remained a few notches below the ambrosial feast that I was anticipating given the rave reviews here. \n\nOur spread included:\nCream of Chicken Soup.. Very rich and creamy. The kids loved it!\nPaneer Reshmi Handi.. Delicious, but a tad bit over-rated. Honestly speaking, it tasted just like pasta in white sauce sans the pasta! This was pointed out by my 7-year old, and after that I had a hard time eating it with naan. :/\nSeekh Kababs, Behari Chicken Boneless, and Malai Tikka.. all were good but I've had better! Malai tikka was slightly undercooked. (Seriously!!)\nGarlic naans: the first two were dry and hard, the third one was soft and fluffy (since we had complained about the first batch) and then the fourth one was again like the first two.  \n\nAll food was delivered hot and fresh (barring the naans), and stayed so despite the open air seating. The floor manager was very interested in our feedback and we did point out the shortcomings. \n\nI wouldn't mind going to Kolachi again for its serene and magical surroundings. Perhaps I'll sample the non-desi entr?es next time.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-22T20:47:16+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-23T05:34:13+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"463561057028383","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Saira Malik don't.

I've heard a few people take issue with the scooping method and we're really thinking about switching to the rounded scoops instead of the italian spatula for this reason, so stay tuned on that front. As for the taste of the gelato, we use nothing synthetic i assure you, all the ingredients we use are real and fresh. Our cookie dough flavour called Chocochipper, is made with real chocolate chip cookies that we make in house, the same you can buy. The vanilla is a madagascar vanilla and while I can understand if you didn't love it, rest assured it's not synthetic.

So good choice for using that service for delivery De Joe. The order was a couple of minutes late but excusable. Suggestion: Please improve the packaging to ensure that things dont get spoilt. The red velvet cake was all over the box because in that box, at least 20 of those pieces could fit whereas there were only 4 so this was bound to happen. The box for the burgers and the fries were perfect.\n\nThe good things about the deal: \n\nThe char broiled burgers are divine. My brother said that they tasted like mini bite-versions of a burger he had at Hardees. He did mean it as a compliment. There was nothing special about the Masala/Spicy fries. The Tex-Mex fries were yummy. The red velvet cake was the best RVC me and my family has had till date. Either the base is not moist, the frosting is too sweet, the base has an eggy smell or the frosting does not do justice to the base. But this RVC is a winner in all aspects. It is even better than Pane and Amore which was so far my fav place for RVC cupcakes. The Nutella cake is par brilliance. There is a thin layer of hazelnuts or walnuts which go crunch crunch in your mouth after mini-intervals. It is so delicious I wanted to cry out loud. \n\nThe bad things about the deal: \n\nThe fact that it is not a 4 person deal, or even a 3 or 2 person deal. \n\nSuggestion: \n\nPrice the deal at 500 bucks, replace the 1.5 litre with a 500 ml one and rename it as UC Iftar Deal. Another suggestion would be to let things the way they are and just increase the size of the cake. It is not actually a cake platter because I have never seen such tiny pieces of cake even in places that have a buffet-style dessert like Al-Bustan.\n\nOnly me and my brother were full. Mom and sister had to have pakoras and yesterday's leftovers coz it was too late to make anything. I told them that 2 deals would be enough for the 4 of us...and it wasn't. Having said that, at least for me and my brother, the experience was outstanding. And my mom and sister also agreed that  everything was yummy...if only the quantities were great.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-11T16:09:19+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-12T12:01:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTg0NjgyMjQz","before":"NjI1OTY4OTUz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"423139494403873","from":{"name":"Sameer Beg","id":"583446948"},"message":"ouch","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-11T16:33:37+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423321851052304","from":{"name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary","id":"100000093496883"},"message":"No, Muneeza Kidwai","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T05:48:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423393174378505","from":{"name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary","id":"100000093496883"},"message":"Pleasure..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T12:01:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDIzMzkzMTc0Mzc4NTA1","before":"NDIzMTM5NDk0NDAzODcz"}}},"restaurantName":"Pan"},{"id":"165861103465048_423127871071702","from":{"name":"Shaikh Rafia","id":"1107630358"},"message":"Aruna Sujanani & other Sindhis on this page: I am not aware of so many dishes this lady has got recipes here.

With the expectation bar at its peak after hearing and reading so much about it on SWOT and outside, I was a bit apprehensive while going. What if it doesn?t turn out as good? What if my grandiose expectations fall flat? Oh well. Nevermind, I reassured myself and our group of 10 with bachas in it went ahead. We reached well after 830pm thanks to the jam packed sea view road that tested both my patience and driving skills. Finally when we reached we were told by the courteous lady at the entrance that we?ll have to wait for anywhere between 30 to 40 minutes to get a table for 10. Though I was warned of the weekend rush that picks up after 830pm my own miscalculation prevented me from pre-booking. Thanks to Muneer Esmail and the ever courteous staff of Kolachi, we managed to get a table well before the time given. And what a lovely spot it was. I could?ve easily spent hours sitting up on the deck overlooking the sea and enjoying the lovely environs. Kolachi cleared its first test with full marks! \n\nThe gentleman who appeared to be the Manager helped us settle and ensured we were comfortable. Our group relied on me to order (knowing fully well that I am the worst at the job). However, thanks to my earlier post on SWOT, I had received some recommendations and decided to play safe. So my pick included Paneer Reshmi Handi, Peshawari Karhai (in Chicken as the group was not inclined towards red meat) and Kolachi Reshmi Kabab. As much as we wanted to try out starters, we chose not too as the popcorns at Cineplex right before the journey to Kolachi didn?t allow that. So we settled on the main course. For this trip only! \n\nBachas in our group are notorious for ordering fries wherever they go! They frown and fret and make a fuss if they don?t find their favorite starter. Fortunately Kolachi didn?t let us down there! Kids were happy with cheesy and Masala fries to start off their meal. For drinks, I went ahead with Muneer?s recommendation and ordered Blue Colada. Some in the group ordered Lemon Mint Glacier while the rest settled for soft drinks or fresh lime. \n\nFood at Kolachi came, saw and conquered! Literally! Paneer Reshmi Handi was well beyond our expectations. It was simply divine! I profusely thanked SWOTTIES who recommended it!! I wanted to devour more than my appetite allowed. And I did. Peshawari Karhai was well cooked and tasted heavenly. With roghni naan, the food was sheer delight. Reshmi Kababs were fresh and tender. They complemented well. \n\nI am forever thankful to Muneer for recommending Blue Colada! It was fantastic. I acted the bad one by not sharing it with anybody which I usually do. The evil me had it all and craved for more!! However I didn?t want to explode so resisted. There was no space left for even tea. So we got up after the lovely food and an excellent service. I must compliment the staff. I wonder how they remain so polite and attentive given the number of people frequenting the place and demanding personalized service! Hats off to the management of Kolachi. \n\nNeedless to say Kolachi is on my radar now and I?ll be visiting the place more often!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-16T06:26:33+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-16T19:42:33+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"688336352","name":"Abbas Farid"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI1OTY4OTUz","before":"NTI0NDc2NzM1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"413375985380224","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Yum!!

Golden Dragon - My new love for Thai and Chinese food. Hot favourites: American Chopsuey, Crispy Beef, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Hot and Sour Soup, Thai Soup, Thai Green Curry, Wontons, Zingers and Chicken Karhai (the last two from their Lunch Xpress section)\n\n2. Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb's warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I'm not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away. Will go soon to be blown away by other things too.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-25T18:59:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-27T14:47:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"505164013","name":"Yasmeen Agad-Kothawala"},{"id":"515396294","name":"Danish Ali Dahraj"},{"id":"100003249618202","name":"Heer Ahmed"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"500907007","name":"Murtaza Moiz"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNjUxNzIy","before":"NjU3MDMxNzQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"404073356310487","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"i see myself featured here too, obliged and humbled Hajra Amir","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T19:33:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir","type":"user","offset":52,"length":10}]},{"id":"404123489638807","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Thank you Hajra :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T21:13:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra","type":"user","offset":10,"length":5}]},{"id":"404386042945885","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"These places are on my fingertips 24/7!!!

Ambiance was nice, a serene enviroment welcomes you on arrival. Unlike other places on that strip its not overcrowded despite having a crowded look on the outside. Seating arrangement is spacious and comfortable, with sofa's and chairs at three different levels. They have a upper deck, a middle level, a lower deck and a sheesha lounge, the middle two being right on the ocean and one can actually feel the tide come and hit the rocks below coupled will the flood lights on the sea which creates an enchanting effect.Coming to the service aspect both the staff and servers are more like programmed robots and need to be more vigilant to the diners needs, they keep sauntering around the place but to get hold of them is a tough task. A bottle of water took 15-20 minutes to arrive, its seemed like they were manufacturing it, drinks arrived ten minutes after dinner was served and I had to remind them, coordination is lacking and staff was not properly trained in this aspect. Ordered their Charcoal Combo platter, which was fresh and crisp comprising of batter fried mushrooms, chicken wings and fried chicken with mozzarella cheese accompanied with two yummy dips, also had the Beef Cheese Burger and Chicken Fajita Burger both well done, were well flavored, succulent pieces of grilled chicken breast and had a spicy tinge, but the bread was not as it should be, a bit soggy and quality of the bun could be improved, fries could be more crisp. For desert had Blueberry Cheese Cake was very good, light and fluffy with a biscuit crust, really melted in the mouth, a generous helping for two to three weight watchers. Overall experience was good, a place which stands out from the crowd and has an air of sophistication, recommended for foreign guests who may have the impression that Karachi is a city under siege or civil war, taking them to this places will showcase the soft face of Karachi and the beauty of the sea. They just need to work a tad bit more on their service.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-24T11:24:45+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-24T15:29:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"741265709","name":"Sarah Hasnat"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQxMjY1NzA5","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"403364046381418","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Try Kolachi next time.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T15:11:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403370973047392","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Kolachi is the next target...what do u recommend?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T15:27:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403372099713946","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Hunzai Handi.

I went out to Biryani of the Seas (BOTS) last Sunday and it actually turned to be a gastronomical disaster. I was extremely disappointed because while the food wasn't horrible, this place came highly recommended by family and friends, however the food they served was nothing to write home about. Here are the highlights :\n\n1)Prawn Biryani :- We started off with a prawn biryani which we assumed to be a house speciality. They biryani that was served was unusually cold, had a very subtle hint of masala and had all of 7-8 tiny prawns (yes, I counted). I completely understand if the lack of prawn was due to the breeding season but our server said nothing of this sort to us when we ordered.\n\n2) Tawa Chicken : Things simply went downhill after the biryani. The Tawa chicken incorporated two pieces of burnt chicken and the chicken was also overcooked on the inside. I was a little confused by this dish because having had tawa chicken in other places, I assumed that they would use boneless chicken instead of a breast and a leg piece. Additionally, While I appreciated the nice kick that the dish had, the rest of the table thought that the extra spice was simply trying to overcompensate for what the dish lacked.\n\n3) Leather jacket fillet : While the fish was perfectly cooked, I couldn't even detect a hint of flavour in it, not sure if the Tawa chicken had sabotaged my taste buds by this time but this dish felt oddly plain.\n\nOn a more positive note, the honey chilli prawns were satisfactory and the assorted chicken bbq made it worth our while to dine here but on the whole BOTS turned out to be a disappointing experience. I am not sure if I caught them during an off-night or if my expectations were too highly but BOTS failed to live up to hype for me.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-16T21:42:50+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-18T15:53:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"100002402711136","name":"Tazeen Hasan"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2","before":"MTAwMDAxODU4NDUwMDEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"399064373478052","from":{"name":"Khalid Ishaq","id":"680185313"},"message":"Quite a\nSimilar experience\nHad food poisoning after my first visit to BOTS n on d second trip ordered tawa chicken which was almost burnt","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T21:53:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399066506811172","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"To each his own....I eat BOTS 3 times a week...no problem so far","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T21:59:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399094416808381","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Looks like i spoke to soon about not getting complaints for a while on SWOTS :) - But Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

Service through-out was supereb & our 10 orders of meals & coffee were served within 10 mins.\nHowever, the food was strictly ok, we ordered English & Mediterranean Meals with scrambled & fried eggs, pancakes stack with maple and chicken omelette. None of us enjoyed the Mediterranean meal; & the English had nothing especial about them, however my eggs were made perfectly just the way I like 'em. But the Turkey Bacon was dry & chewy and they seriously need to do something with their hash browns dint  taste like hash browns at all & looked like a cross between home-made potato cutlets & Gratin Potatoes. Not Good. I don't like Roasted Tomatoes, dint touch them.\nAlso, how can you not serve butter with bread??! They did serve us loads of it when we asked but it was cold & not at room temperature, the way I like.\nWhile cappuccinos & cold coffee were nice, the triple chocolate ice coffee only had ice, I couldn't taste any chocolate, let only triple choc!!\nTheir cup cakes were perched on the counter tempting us to try them; I wanted to have the red velvet & choc marble ones, but another customer beat me to the race to the counter & we were left with only mint choc & German choc cupcakes and my-oh-my what cup cakes they were, i already love mint choc but the german choc ones made be a believer. I'll go there gain & again, not for the breakfast but for the cupcakes. Divine!!\nThe credit card device was not working but thankfully we were carrying cash. The manager gave us a 15% discount & also offered a 30% discount card [waiting for it to be delivered soon, so that I get discount on cupcakes :)].\nThey now just need to make their food as great as their service.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-16T10:27:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-16T10:30:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"533447656","name":"Saniea Akhtar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTMzNDQ3NjU2","before":"NjY1MDkxODIw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"398785953505894","from":{"name":"Syed Zubair Bin Saeed","id":"576972332"},"message":"https://twitter.com/SyedBinSaeed/status/213921788302868480/photo/1","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T10:29:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"398786360172520","from":{"name":"Syed Zubair Bin Saeed","id":"576972332"},"message":"https://twitter.com/SyedBinSaeed/status/213923144623337473/photo/1","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T10:30:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzk4Nzg2MzYwMTcyNTIw","before":"Mzk4Nzg1OTUzNTA1ODk0"}}},"restaurantName":"Pan"},{"id":"165861103465048_393441424040347","from":{"name":"Marium Ali","id":"604740338"},"message":"super amazing chinese food place to order in from?? need to plan menu for house guests","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-06T10:32:18+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-13T20:17:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1251813282","name":"Idris Inya"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTI1MTgxMzI4Mg\u003d\u003d","before":"MTI1MTgxMzI4Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"393447464039743","from":{"name":"Sahar Iqbal","id":"509422944"},"message":"Golden Dragon","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T10:53:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393447594039730","from":{"name":"Marium Ali","id":"604740338"},"message":"seriously golden dragon is the best?? hmm i thought something else would come up, i have had golden dragon..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T10:53:58+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393451024039387","from":{"name":"Mehvish Abubakar","id":"508922509"},"message":"Try Jade Garden!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T11:02:27+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393453070705849","from":{"name":"Sahar Iqbal","id":"509422944"},"message":"Well Mariam u didn't ask for the best :) and depends what exactly u r looking for.

Just had breakfast at Pane Amore...Other than being ridiculously good value for money (half price deal till tues) the ambiance was refreshing...loved their all white interior. The service and hospitality great. Their peanut butter and chocolate cupcake was food-gasmically yumm! Omlettes were the best eggs I have had in a long time we had the spinach bacon n cheese and bacon n pesto. Cant decide which was better so it was a good job we ordered both and shared ;0) I think what made them so good was the quality of cheese used...it was REAL cheese. The hash browns however I think need to be re-thought...they were more of the aloo ke patties type texture with bread crumbs on them. Loved the herby grilled tomato though. The pancakes also need to be re-thought...we had the ricotta cheese and apples. There wasnt enough fruit on them. And the actual pancakes were a little limp and doughy. Perhaps asking the customer if they want white or brown bread instead of being given both would have been nice and butter or jam. The omlettes and cupcakes though totally made up for these tiny blimps. I will be back there (v soon) for more!!

Now I'll come down to the con's , I was thoroughly disappointed in fact even embarrassed when the waiter at the cafe said that they were outta Froyo (both flavours) and all he could get me was one large cup of chocolate Froyo (We were 5 people we ended up sharing it yes thats pretty sad in itself ) , the part that was disappointing was that it was just 10 pm on a weekend night in Karachi people usually go out to a cafe at that time for dessert and when you end up coming out empty handed its the worst feeling ever. Secondly the flavours for the Froyo were pretty limited Chocolate and Mixed Fruit respectively I think there should be more flavours. We thought of opting for some other desserts then but when we went to check out the dessert window there wasn't much to choose from. I didn't see any of the delicious looking cakes or cupcakes that are posted on the official Upper Crust page anywhere in the cafe. We ended up going to the Hotspot instead and were thoroughly satisfied like always . I am definitely willing to give the place another shot since its a relatively new place and with a really enthusiastic owner it definitely does have potential to improve.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-04T19:33:23+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-07T12:33:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002605916001","name":"Sadaf Munir"},{"id":"603490700","name":"Mariam Bilgrami"},{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njc3Mjk1NTYz","before":"MTAwMDAyNjA1OTE2MDAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"271636166220874","from":{"name":"Maleeha Jawaid","id":"785615314"},"message":"Bilal you're baackkk","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-04T19:43:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"271641302887027","from":{"name":"Bilal Hassan","id":"512386146"},"message":"Yayyy I be back yo","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-04T19:45:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"271653646219126","from":{"name":"De Joe","id":"597535350"},"message":"This was our 15th day, in business.

Sad only 4 places are open: babuji's, gardenia, city bistro and aylanto bistro. \n\nOpted for city bistro. We initially very hesitant to try but: WOW!!!! We ordered crispy chicken in tandoori sauce, pan fried fish and a chicken burger. Very flavourful. Crispy chicken was made crispy by cooking filet  pure american style recipe of hash browns. Wow! Simply elegant. Cant think of any other word. Pan fried fish in creamy lemon butter sauce: soooooooo beautiful it . A good big fillet in subtle flavours. Both dishes were served with herbed mashed potatoes had flawless texture and flavour.  My chicken burger was a patty in fresh bread. Nothing exotic but since i was hesitant i opted for a  safe bet. It was good. Nothing delightful but definitely pleasant.  Remarkable how all meats were perfectly moist and nothing felt rich. Obverall a great meal. 3 ppl, redemption 1s. 300. After redemption net bill was Rs. 1260. A good meal on a not hefty dent to a pocket.
