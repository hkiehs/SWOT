Hold on a sec guys.... Well it is the truth but not the whole truth. The newly opened The Ocean Mall has the amazing The Farid's Grocers in the basement. They have kept some selected items from Rahat Bakery. Now the packaging was the same old yellow pack with the famous red logo but I didn't see their usual stuff. There were no biscuits or salad or donuts. The bread also looked different. They were taking pizza order but their usual variety was missing. I was not at all convinced or excited that I did not buy anything so no taste review. It missed the typical wow what a bakery feel that one gets when one enters RAHAT in Islamabad. Even if it is original it is not too exciting.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-05T19:08:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-05T20:42:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"654496069","name":"Janil Jean"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjU0NDk2MDY5","before":"NjU0NDk2MDY5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"598738733510614","from":{"name":"Cyra Anklesaria","id":"557321236"},"message":"I bought a packet of nan khatai bicuits -\nhave never heard of this bakery - \nthe biscuits were very yummy - \nalmost like english short bread","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-05T19:11:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"598739376843883","from":{"name":"Uzma Farhan","id":"518222620"},"message":"Well the original RAHAT has short bread biscuits which are equally yummy.
