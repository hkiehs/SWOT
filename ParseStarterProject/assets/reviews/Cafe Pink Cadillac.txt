And it was heaven !\nHad dinner over there and it was outclass.\n\nSo here's what we ordered:\n \n1. V8 combo platter: it was one hell of a platter.. The sauces were delicious and chili bites, cheese sticks, chicken wings [cannot remember all the stuff because we literally jumped onto the platter :p]\n\n2.The Cordon Burger: the bun was soft and it had the yummiest chicken fillings in it.\n\n3. American Chicken: for all the spice lovers-it's a must have !\n\n4. Moroccan Chicken: was spicy and high on flavors.\n\nThe whole meal as compared to the cost was totally worth it. The food was delicious. The serving was prompt. Oh yes and we got a complimentary hot'n'sour soup that was served in an amazing bread bowl :)\n\nAmbience was okish as it's a hookah lounge too..but i guess when you are really hungry it's just the taste that matters and nothing else. So all in all it was good.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-22T20:59:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-23T13:55:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1366119997","name":"Samra Sahar Khan"},{"id":"580535576","name":"Marium Abid"},{"id":"747835455","name":"Shujjat Abbas"},{"id":"645995992","name":"Rida Sadiq"},{"id":"1359766063","name":"Faaz Shabbir"},{"id":"701630728","name":"Muhammad Aly"},{"id":"1427899323","name":"Salman Makhdoom"},{"id":"556375229","name":"Kainaat Ghani"},{"id":"100003570224157","name":"Kashif Khan"},{"id":"1112336108","name":"Areeb Zaidi"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"100004603534100","name":"Faiz Mari"},{"id":"1312624554","name":"Khadija Raheem"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"1472049438","name":"Farhan Ahmed Aftab"},{"id":"1514501742","name":"Farhat Shafquat"},{"id":"906125623","name":"Azharuddin Kazi"},{"id":"100001352416590","name":"Zulekha Rizwan"},{"id":"100007206697811","name":"Zohra Baai"},{"id":"100005095573413","name":"Saher Khan"},{"id":"100002668207268","name":"Dania Faisal Tai"},{"id":"537160309","name":"Wajiha Ghani"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100001439501303","name":"Ayan Rauf Usmani"},{"id":"641324643","name":"Nadia Moqeet"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQxMzI0NjQz","before":"MTM2NjExOTk5Nw\u003d\u003d"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_670644842986669/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjQxMzI0NjQz"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"670647842986369","from":{"name":"MehRose Khan","id":"100001217752738"},"message":"WoW yummmy!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-22T21:05:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"670658659651954","from":{"name":"Alysheh Faruqui","id":"557750970"},"message":"I've heard it has a bit of a night club feel.
