Thats how a beef 'gravy' should be so if m ordering their Hakka Lunch Box, i just discovered what my gravy shall ne\n\nDried Red Pepper Chicken : Another love and distinct from typical dry mains! The Chicken had a touch of white pepper too if m not wrong and it gave it spicy flavor a fusion of spicy tinges\n\nEgg fried rice : I found them pleasant, But since RED emp claims its 'Hakka Chinese' i will surely admit there is something different about there food, probably Hakka spices so yes its different from other Chinese Eateries\n\nGreen Fish Curry: I liked it, it was done the Thai I'm assuiming and would love to try again.\n\nBUS, sub kuch khaa jaati tou fellow swotties would have wondered m goinf crazy:p\n\nOverall I'd rate it an 8/10 on taste/variety and mahol:p\nIt was not EXTRAORDINARY but considering i havent been to  any buffets in K town other than lalqila etc, this is for sure  pleasant change\n\nJust made a reservation for my aunt too so yes if u wana 'toot parofy' on food other than desi, U can pay a visit, atleast I would :)\nThe company added to the merriment so thank u Yasir, Ayesha, Ahmareen, Zahid, Nabeel, Mehvish, Deen and Rabeet for sure :p","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-11T14:59:38+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-12T01:34:12+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"100006175172800","name":"Hakka RedEmperor"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"520175866","name":"Mazahir Ali"},{"id":"1035196445","name":"Anusha Ahmed"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100000114960083","name":"Irfan Lala"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"},{"id":"1208451657","name":"Noman Babar"},{"id":"572961915","name":"Abdul Moiz"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"100002218273783","name":"Sana Nabi"},{"id":"692511440","name":"Naila Wasti"},{"id":"586515644","name":"Faiza Gul Hussain"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"629070318","name":"Fahad Usman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI5MDcwMzE4","before":"MTAwMDAyOTAxNjA2ODYw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"665104543540699","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"OMG I made so many grammar and language errors :/ *feeling Jahil*","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T15:12:05+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665105893540564","from":{"name":"Rabeet Rao","id":"749204552"},"message":"Did you type this with your toes?

Here we go:\n\nThe Good:\n-Nice looking place, very nicely done interior and exterior.\n-Quiet location, bad day for traffic.\n-Courteous staff. Tried their level best to deliver good service during the peak hour.\n-Nice touch with the green tea.\n-Really liked the peanut sauce with the nicely done chicken satay. Good stuff.\n\nThe Bad:\n-One of the LOUDEST places I've been to. These places are supposed to be quiet and relaxing. Not the restaurant's fault if the crowd is loud? It all starts when you have to speak over something. usually loud music.\n-The waiter either didn't know the serving size or lied about tit so that we order the bigger serving. Starter serving size turned out to be wrong. First said 8, We opted for the smaller size. Then 4, we switched to the larger size. Turned out to be 6. Also, smart tactic...suggested we order 1 big and 1 small serving of rice, knowing it wouldn't be enough for us so that we order an additional smaller one. Mo' Money, yo.\n-Table prep and utensil presentation was careless and poor\n-The grilled hot/spicy beef thing was grilled wayyyyy too much (photo attached). A bit beyond charred. I don't think it's supposed to look and taste burnt. Called back the waiter, took and showed to someone. They said it's supposed to be like that but...could have tasted good if it were not like that. BAD choice. Don't recommend. \n-The red curry chicken was wayyyyy too salty. Burning salty. Sadness.\n-The crispy prawns with lemon sauce was...a dish full of tiny 1/2 inch fried prawns, covered in an OK batter, rolling around on the plate, dry, with some lemon and butter sauce in a little sauce bowl thing. for over Rs. 700. Beyond disappointing. Total rip-off. Never ever order it.\n-The waiter got the drink order wrong. No biggie.\n-Kung Pao chicken was a random bowl of chicken and vegetables but not bad. Nothing special, bad presentation.\n-Got some left-overs packed. They magically reduced to half their original quantity when we got home.\n-Food was served like 40-45 minutes after the order. Not a large order.\n\nPlace: 8/10\nAmbience: 4.5/10 for being TOO loud and haphazard\nFood: 6/10\nValue for money: 6.5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-08T12:02:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-09T09:07:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002332607255","name":"Hira Zahoor"},{"id":"503984035","name":"Ayesha Shaukat"},{"id":"652385634","name":"Fahad Asadullah"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"505055634","name":"Umme Ifrah Arif"},{"id":"581947488","name":"Nida Fahd"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTgxOTQ3NDg4","before":"MTAwMDAyMzMyNjA3MjU1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"582163635168124","from":{"name":"Abdul Shakoor Motiwala","id":"590540852"},"message":"totally agree i did not like there food end of story","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-08T12:46:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"582183865166101","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"They feel grilled and burnt are synonymous.

We have no comparison with Ginsoy as they're serving Extreme Chinese and we're serving Hakka Chinese. Hakka Chinese is a distinct cuisine of Chine which is acquainting the market, at the moment. The names may be similar to our competitors but we're solely striving for our identity and not being a substitute for other eateries. The prices have been set to what matches our costing and market, nor an 'at par' comparison with Ginsoy. There is nothing 'wannabe' about it if our ambiance depicts the name we've given to our eatery. We're serving food to please customers like you and that would remain our first and foremost priority.

The disappointing part was the main course apparently the thai chow mien means a spicier version of Chinese chow mien. Than the real disappointment I am sure almost anyone been to Ginsoy must have had the cherry chilli chicken so I ordered it in RE as well there was no gravy it was fried dry chicken and instead of canned cherries or fresh cherries they had used the sugary type of cherries that you use in cakes which gave the whole dish a very weird sweetish kick. \n\nService was also good something Teamginsoy Ginsoy needs to take a lesson from as when in rush hours the service is not upto the mark.\n\nPricing was also similar to Ginsoy you can have half portions as well but that makes me question if I want Chinese why not go to Ginsoy ?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-28T09:40:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-29T14:52:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d","before":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"577638808953940","from":{"name":"Sana Abdullah","id":"627747302"},"message":"For service and ambiance.

However we'd like to clarify a couple of things. Firstly we are not in the market to compete with Ginsoy. We have no comparison with Ginsoy as they're serving Extreme Chinese and we're serving Hakka Chinese. Hakka Chinese is a distinct cuisine of Chine which is acquainting the market, at the moment. The names may be similar to our competitors but we're solely striving for our identity and not being a substitute for other eateries. The prices have been set to what matches our costing and market, nor an 'at par' comparison with Ginsoy. There is nothing 'wannabe' about it if our ambiance depicts the name we've given to our eatery. We're serving food to please customers like you and that would remain our first and foremost priority.
