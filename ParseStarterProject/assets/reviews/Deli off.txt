A google description says it should be:\nKhow Suey is a Burmese (from Burma) noodle dish with a delicately spiced coconut milk sauce and is served with an array of different contrasting condiments/toppings.\n\nI got a medium sized portion of very dry noodles, with one slice of lemon on top, a hint of crispy fried onions, some slivers of scallion.... and that was about it. It was the equivalent of eating a plate of linguine ala Thai. NO sign of the coconut milk sauce. Foodies, please educate me, is this par for the course at The Deli?\nWent home and had a proper dinner.","type":"status","created_time":"2014-01-10T16:08:09+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-11T21:51:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"506324326","name":"Ahsan Virani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA2MzI0MzI2","before":"NTA2MzI0MzI2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"680558311995322","from":{"name":"Ashnaa F Khan","id":"650649934"},"message":"How did you eat Khow Suey without the signature yummy yellow curry :/\nNot sure if all of the versions have coconut milk in it.

They give Slimes along with the curry which I think can be sprinkle over it or can be consumed as sideline. :D Plus it come in both chicken and beef.
