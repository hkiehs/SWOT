First time i tried red riding hood bakery ferrero rocher cake when the bakery had recently opened, the cake was yummy and the ferrero's were crispy and fresh. 2nd time i tried snickers cake which had stale peanuts. Then again I bought Ferrero Rocher cake in ramadan 2013 and the ferrero's and hazelnuts were badly stale. I decided not to buy cakes from this bakery as the pricing is high end and cakes were consistently stale. However after we saw the new advertisement with stunning pictures of the variety of cakes at this bakery I committed the sin of ordering belgian chocolate cake. The cake was stale and crumbly, the frosting is more butter cream and conceals all the goodness of belgian chocolate, if at all the frosting did contain belgian chocolate. Only the sides of the cake (tempered chocolate) tasted belgian. Waste of money and calories!","type":"photo","created_time":"2014-01-07T12:20:27+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-08T19:20:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"792915494","name":"Ahmad Fayyaz Ali"},{"id":"745469021","name":"Hiba Ali"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"500883930","name":"Saira Inam"},{"id":"100001602140079","name":"S?fyan Sha?kh"},{"id":"100000821282488","name":"Erum Shoaib"},{"id":"585445861","name":"Mehak Nayani"},{"id":"100001803662044","name":"Zarmeen Jameel"},{"id":"1176961934","name":"Muneeba Motiwala"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"607755094","name":"Fareena Lodhi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA3NzU1MDk0","before":"NzkyOTE1NDk0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"678880935496393","from":{"name":"Fareena Lodhi","id":"607755094"},"message":"Totally agree with you Sara Lodhi.

Secondly, we dont use butter cream in our frosting at all, All the cakes are made by melting original chocolates, the belgian is a mix of both Milk and dark chocolate, dark on the outside and milk on the top and inside. We use barry Callibaut couverture, you can google it to find out, its a high end brand used in making chocolates and frosting. Im unable to understand where did you find the butter in belgian. People have different opinion about products but I guess you should confirm it from the makers what ingredients they are using. Also I would like to highlight we never make ganash and coat over something else, you can dissect the cake to see whats outside is inside. Having said that, we dont want to disregard your complain, you must bring the cake to the bakery, we will listen to your complain and compensate you if there is a mistake at our end and make sure your money is not gone wasted.

For us Belgium chocolate means, Cort D'OR, Guylian, Godiva etc. Using Barry Callibaut couverture totally depends on who the chef/ baker is and from where the sourcing is being done. Most of the stuff available with retailers and looking at the price of riding hood bakery's cake, the couverture being used is of the lowest quality available with most retailers; that explains the butter cream like texture and taste. Secondly next time tell the guests before serving the cake that we will take turns tasting the cake to make sure stale cake is returned to the bakery.....lolz or better still stick to our former favorites such as flo's orange chocolate, Neco's twix cheese, Espresso's chocolate cake, pie in the sky's Lemon cake etc. I'm really surprised at the customer service concept at some places; customer is the king, customer is always right are cliche' terms when the number of customers is increasing..... Customer doesn't have high end taste, customer is a liar are in vogue :) now I'm a little curious how are you going to get the Belgium cake out of the stomachs of the guests it was served to and take it back to the bakery? Some solution huh... Some ownership of any problems caused by his end as per Muhammad Ali Raza. Well Sara babes so it's ok if riding hood loses some 100 odd customers we marketed the Ferrero cake to ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-07T18:48:20+0000","like_count":10,"user_likes":false},{"id":"679034065481080","from":{"name":"Fareena Lodhi","id":"607755094"},"message":"Ali Rush just heard Juda....you've sung it really well.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-07T18:50:34+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"679057435478743","from":{"name":"S?fyan Sha?kh","id":"100001602140079"},"message":"And I was thinking to order Snicker Cake. \nBachat hogai. :D\nThanks. :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-07T19:59:12+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"679265808791239","from":{"name":"Sara Lodhi","id":"100006253505868"},"message":"Dear Ali Rush, my taste buds must have gone bad from the initial ferrero rocher cake i had and absolutely loved when many people didnt know about the red riding hood bakery i spread the word around and i can guarantee you i made you some customers. I think i can tell stale nuts and stale ferrero being a chocolate junkie. Let me tell you i complained at each subsequent visit and the lady at khadda market outlet said and i quote \"yes maam we got multiple complaints and now we use fresh imported chocolates only\". Even when ordering belgian on sunday i confirmed on phone n told the guy about stale nuts in last 2 cakes. I am writing only after 3 consecutive ( 3 consecutive can be called hatrick asif ali) bad cake experiences and noone at the outlet offering any consolation. I wrote tempered chocolate and no where did i mention ganache, also i thought that frosting that sticks to the top of your palate is butter cream, also i googled the product u use and this variant of belgian chocolate has a lot of cocoa butter which chefs say splits apart when u hear the chocolate, that explains what i tasted. i might not be a food connoisseur but I have been to belgium and tried many belgian chocolates which taste quite different but im not doubting what you use in your cake only saying that goodness of the belgian chocolat was concealed in the cake i got. Also the fact is that cake was falling apart crumbs everywhere and was 100% stale and all my guests had the same opinion. Service industry needs to improve, a group of colleagues had a bad experience at pizza hut where a full grown big roach was an added topping on the supreme pizza at chundrigar some 3 yrs back and the management really didnt do anything to repent (i have 13 witnesses and we even took pictures and wrote a complaint to the local and international management, no response). PH is doing well and has a growing customer base. At another restaurant olivetto grill a guest complained that grilled fish serving size has been reduced and voila there was complimentary serving of a full platter of grilled fish and bread pudding (even though the person who complained had finished his food when making the plaint thus no evidence was offered). Olivetto is not doing well but definitely they have a good service culture.  Your business is thriving with new outlet at sehr and counter at tee emm so losing 1 customer might not be a big deal but you can google brand management and service culture and you will find that each customer is important. As far as brand bashing is concerned, all posts on this forum are approved by admin and both good and bad reviews are posted. Having said this i will continue to try the cakes at the red riding hood as i have twix and after eight on my list of cakes to try. If i get a stale cake again, i will save a slice and make an effort to drive back to the outlet and submit evidence.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-08T06:38:15+0000","like_count":14,"user_likes":false},{"id":"679318902119263","from":{"name":"Hiba Ali","id":"745469021"},"message":"Had a really  bad experience too , my fiance ordered for me the same belgian chocolate cake for my birthday with my picture on it.

Even i had seen the cake's original pic on the page before. the cake was a surprise for me i dint know which one he had ordered. When he saw the pic of the cake delivered he got so angry that it was NOTHING like the cake he had selectd except for my picture, and guess what i liked it thinking it was some other simple sa cute cake and when he told me which one it was i was horrified! He inboxed riding hood bakery that he was too disappointed in them and dint a bit like the cake. They had asked for little changes in the cake to make it EVEN better n since my fiance isnt in Pak he saw their pics n thought yea why not the cake is so pretty it wud be even better. And he was so sad i cant even tell you! The taste was good,i wont lie but he still feels he got cheated . They replied that they were sad that he dint like it but hoped that i wud like the taste.

Firstly, he is totally caring person :) as we had long conversations about the design and he specifically asked me to give it my creative liberty and since he wanted it in cream, not in fondant, it was totally different from the picture he selected. I also assured him that the lucky girl for whom he has ordered this is going to love it, as the design was girly :) and asked him to get in touch with me after the cake reaches you, he didn't. So I am happy you liked the design, and as communicated to him, it was supposed to be different from Marilyn monroe one.

Dinner at Olivetto after a long hiatus, and I doubt I'll be going back again.  The place has a formal ambiance, with Eminem talking about someone's mother, and some guys rapping about flying high like a Gulfstream.  The music being played was a disaster, and the place rivaled McDonalds and Burger King in playing the most retarded music.  \n\nThe bread served with Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar was fresh, and reminded me of the standard starters served on the Mediterranean coast.  Wouldn't mind having a more generous serving of Olive Oil, as what was served was barely sufficient for one person.\n\nOrdered the Arabic Platter, Meaty Lasagne, and Chicken Florentine for main course.  The Arabic Platter was brilliant, the lamb was moist, succulent, and juicy -- while the beef was cooked to perfection.  The pita was fresh, and the serving of Hummus was generous.  \n\nThe lasagne was a disaster -- it lacked texture, and the taste was just off.  Pizza Hut served a better lasagne once upon a time.  The Chicken Florentine was decent, but can't figure the nomenclature when it lacked the primary ingredient, i.e. spinach.   Also ordered Chocolate Molten Lava - it was grainy, and better offerings are served by other eateries.\n\nThe place levies a service charge, which basically means the patron pays a component of staff salaries, which is supposed to be built in the prices on the menu.  Soon enough, they may also start charging Generator Charges, Gas Charges, etc.  \n\nAs a policy, I don't like to go to places which have 'service charges' in place -- so I guess, I will be avoiding Olivetto for good.  If (almost) European prices are being paid in Karachi, and there is nothing special about the food -- a place is better off being avoided.\n\nOverall Rating -- 6/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-02T21:07:14+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-03T15:14:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1360134242","name":"Fahima Mubashir"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"},{"id":"1031220895","name":"M Saquib Khwaja"},{"id":"1086930427","name":"Ali Saif Memon"},{"id":"776525430","name":"Khadija Tahir"},{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"1198610816","name":"Maheen Siddiqui"},{"id":"746376004","name":"Sameen Shahid"},{"id":"851275369","name":"Belinda Fonseca"},{"id":"100001185864732","name":"Faryal Noman"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1247552277","name":"Abdullah Farooq"},{"id":"844625322","name":"Goher Zaman"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

So as hungry we could be we ordered grilled tiger paprika prawns as starter, Mixed arabic platter, chkn in gresh mushroom sauce and Oli's meaty lasagne as main entre.\nOverall the food tasted good along with the ambiance and service.\nHowever; \nthe starter had a surprise,, the prawns were not 'Tiger' at all,,  they were literally regular sized prawns ,, and all in all total 4 of them.. Okay i understand they were starters but for Rs. 1000 it could have been better.\nArabic platter had kebabs, shish touk, lamb chops and humus... kebabs were perfect so was humus and shish touk..But; \nThe lamb chops were such a big No,,, the meat was extremely soft - no bite - it was like gulping it down rather than chewing it (like you have cereals in hot milk)... The chops were thin (you could compare it with the skewer sticks) it was kind of tasteless in itself, had some sort of sweetness and gelatin layer at the top... Couldn't eat it after few bites..

An ordinary one but less ordinary. more special in a way that it was filling.\n\nBacon Peperroni Jalapeno Pizza, 6/10 but upto the mark. maybe change the cheese topping. loved the crust though. fresh and crispy, this was a thin pan. \n\nTeriyaki Chicken, 5/10. big no from us. i think everyone just cannot do teriyaki. \n\nChicken Scallaponi, 8/10 this was my order. i dont remember much about this one, since i was busy tasting the others but i do remember that next time i goto monte cristo, i have to order one of these again.\n\nthe highlight of the night was the beef fillet, after such a long time, someone understood what medium rare is, and it was cooked to perfection. i was so happy to see it, that i forgot everything on the table. i found this to be so heavenly, i was almost envious why i did not order the fillet. Mushroom Sauce, impeccable. 9.5/10. perfectly seasoned, grilled, butter fried oh i want to have it right now !\n\nThanks Montecristo, i think we will become good friends. \n\nHaris Shaikh","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-25T06:30:55+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-26T11:26:29+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100006409002964","name":"Sirfraz Ali"},{"id":"530060365","name":"Abdul Wajid Qureshi"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"505552596","name":"Rabiya Anjum"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"558178102","name":"Safoora Fahad"},{"id":"569219957","name":"Naveed Ashraf"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"517470504","name":"Nida Ali"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"100003698171140","name":"Asra Mushtaq"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"642953122","name":"Amer Zahid"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"571357266","name":"Khurram Zameer"},{"id":"100001651622767","name":"Fatima Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNjUxNjIyNzY3","before":"MTAwMDA2NDA5MDAyOTY0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"624086504309170","from":{"name":"Umair Hassan","id":"755585401"},"message":"Fahad Farooq shayan ko dekha do yeh :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T07:36:50+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"577115473","name":"Fahad Farooq","type":"user","offset":0,"length":12}]},{"id":"624191927631961","from":{"name":"Sidra Khatri","id":"514359736"},"message":"lol we also went to Montecristo when we found Olivetto closed and recommended to many friends who also loved it... looks like Olivetto is giving away customers to Montecristo :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T13:32:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624214927629661","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"olivetto is closed on tuesdays","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T14:40:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624244844293336","from":{"name":"Anwer Jamal Chandna","id":"1424317236"},"message":"Haris Shaikh if you could pls name the items in the pictures for better understanding...though liked yr detailed review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T15:42:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624245077626646","from":{"name":"Haris Shaikh","id":"694723124"},"message":"Ok.

Service was a bit slow and there were a few mess ups with the food ordered, but that is understandable seeing as it's Eid and they were probably short on staff :)\nFor starters we ordered a Tomato and Olives Bruschetta. We ordered one, but they gave us two orders :p well, that doesn't matter because we quite enjoyed the starter as it was quite lovely. The soup was ordered was Tomato Soup. It was absolutely divine and creamy and just plain yumm.\nThe main courses were Grilled Chicken with Tarragon Sauce, Grilled Chicken with Mushroom Risotto and Spicy Japanese Chicken. My own main was the Tarragon Chicken and I loved it. Though I do wish there was a little more tarragon sauce. Either way, the chicken was cooked to perfection, the sauce delicious, as were the accompanying saut?ed veggies and mashed potatoes. My mom's main was the chicken with mushroom risotto and she loved her dish, as did I. I love mushrooms and i love risotto and I've found that not many restaurants can put the two together and make it taste divine, by Olivetto and Gon Pacci really do make a really tasty mushroom risotto. I didn't get to try more than a bite of the Spicy Japanese Chicken, that too at the very end, but what I tasted was quite lovely and perfectly spiced.\nOur drinks were a Hazelnut Frappe and an Affogato. Both were perfectly sweet, cold and refreshing, as they were meant to be. All in all, a wonderful fine dining experience! Thank you Gon Pacci for a lovely night :D","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-10T19:39:09+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-10T20:16:25+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"698764443","name":"Shahnawaz Moti"},{"id":"504513463","name":"Fariha A Farooqui"},{"id":"100000087541003","name":"Sarah Iftikhar"},{"id":"813405111","name":"Moiz Ali P"},{"id":"100001132050300","name":"Noor Un Nisa Daudpota"},{"id":"1103653032","name":"Maha Raheel"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEwMzY1MzAzMg\u003d\u003d","before":"NTc1Mjc2NzUy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"601283709922783","from":{"name":"Marvi Shah","id":"522705412"},"message":"Oh and one more thing.

The best thing about this place is that they don?t have uncountable items on their buffet, which just end up causing confusion and I am stuffed by the time I've just tasted most of the items. \nHere, you try everything, and then eat to your heart?s content the ones that you like best.\nStarted off with dates and chilled perfect rooh afza, not too sweet not too watery, just right. And then I moved to the buffet table. It started with traditional iftar items; aalu ke pakoray that were light and crispy, not dripping with oil. Qeema samosas, sweet dahi phulki (i fail to understand why people insist on calling them dahi baray instead of phulki. there is anobvious different of size, recipe and taste!), chana chaat and their special ?kharadar laal masala aalu?. So delicious, tangy, spicy, well cooked. \nAlong with all this was hummus, ezmeh, tabouleh and their special chutnies, with pita bread. Oh and the fruit salad! Made of fresh fruits, very homely. \n\nNow moving on to the main items. The dinner menu? *sigh* \n\nThere were 4 main courses, one each of chicken, fish, beef and shrimp. The penne arrabiata shrimp was penne pasta tossed with tomato sauce (I?m guessing marinara sauce) and shrimps in generous quantities. The asian crispy beef was so succulent and flavourful!!! It was like a burst of flavors with each mouthful. Chicken green chilli stew was really nicely done, but since I?ve had enough of chicken during my diet I just tasted it and it was good.\n\nThe pi?ce de r?sistance of the meal was the spicy mediterranean fish. It was so perfectly cooked, each forkful melted in my mouth like a tiny piece of heaven. The perfect blend of flavors, herbs& spices; mushroom and olives; and the melt-in0my-mouth fish? Oh god, I want more of it now just thinking about it. I tell you it?s a gift descended from the culinary heavens!\n\nAll this is available with the option of light and fresh garlic rice. I just had a bit of the rice, as I didn?t want to mix the flavors of the main courses with rice and dilute their magic \u003dD\nFor dessert, that day they had caramel custard, which was so creamy it was foodgasm in my mouth! And so nice and chilled, just the way desserts should be. They also had traditional sivaiyaan which was a blend of crispy and soft vermicelli, with balanced sweetness. Dil khush kardia!!\n\nOverall, the entire meal light and delicious, I don?t know how much I ate, but I didn?t get the heavy feeling generally followed by iftar buffets. \nOlivetto has always been great with food, never have they ever disappointed me \u003c3\nSpecial thank you to Afroza Bhamani and her team, for giving us this lovely gem of a place. And double thumbs up for maintaining their quality over the times and especially with something like an iftar buffet. At most places, iftar buffets usually don't have the same standards as a la carte menus.\n\nI came home full and happy, with no regrets of cheating on my diet \u003c3","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-26T19:41:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-27T16:01:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"538934895","name":"Amad Ul Hasan Siddiqui"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"562582174","name":"Sarah Ahmed"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"644815164","name":"Ahsan Pervez"},{"id":"646070570","name":"Murtaza Kasmani"},{"id":"509280017","name":"Jamil Rahman"},{"id":"500846017","name":"Sheharyar Mujahid"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"501834092","name":"Fawaz Khan"},{"id":"100000579313166","name":"Xobi Shah"},{"id":"750730596","name":"Rabiea Jameel"},{"id":"1544452028","name":"Sana Wasif"},{"id":"661185719","name":"Aamir Alvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjYxMTg1NzE5","before":"NTM4OTM0ODk1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"593039774080510","from":{"name":"Ayesha Shaukat","id":"503984035"},"message":"N here I thought u were studying for ur mid terms b!

The \"Gosht Nu Dhansak\" (Mutton Daal with Brown Rice) with the kachumar and two types of achaars stole the show, specially the limun aur mirch ka achaar which is made with lemon, ginger and green chillies soaked in lemon juice made me go back over 25 years when this used to be made in our house. Not a big fan of eggs but I must say both the Akoori (scrambled eggs) and Scotch Eggs, both were pretty decent. My earliest memories of Akoori dates back to over 30 years when it was served as a snack in the evenings in the lawns and tennis courts of Karachi Club. The Kolmi Na Kevab (Prawn Kebabs) was very interesting. Was so satisfied with the Dhansak that I didn't try the \"Patra Ni Machi\" (Fish in Green Chutney rolled in Banana Leaves). The \"Lagan Nu Custard\", \"Malpuras\" and \"Savaiyyan\" for dessert were so different and delicious - could not stop my hand at \"Savaiyyan\" and ended up having two large helpings of it.

Anyways, not to dwell into farewell depression, i tried my best to cover all eateries as i could. Summary and ranking goes like:\n\nNew places:\n1. Bella vita- great gelato and a very different pizza! Must visit\n\n2. Kolachi- full marks for ambience( despite 50min wait) and one if the best beef botis, though garlic rice were a big disappointment! Karahi was great!\n\n3. Olivetto- tried there pan asian prawns with rice! Sluurrpp! Veryyyyy nice and must try!\n\n4. Xanders- very nice tomato soup and calamari starter, but the menu lacked depth for dinner. Suggest it to be a breakfast/brunch place thn dinners. Ordered jalape?o chicken pizza but the staff mistakenly served margarita. But they were courteous and apologetic! Hence, forgiven.\n\nOldies which are still goldies:\n\nNo one can beat Zahid ki nihari with garam garam naan still!!!\n\nBots was supreme!! The food covered up for poor service! Honestly, once it arrived (prawn karahi, fried pangush fish, fried prawns)we forgot tht it took ages to get someone to clean the table and take thr order. Ad always, didnt disappoint at all.\n\nTai pan- suprisingly great lunch food! Unlike many years ago whn i went and got served with a bee in the soup :) but this time,everything was awesome.\n\nGlorias beef chilli wrap also was a fav this trip!\n\nBoat basin ka subah ka halwa puri had still maintained its 'to die for' value! The dhaba roadside fun i miss!\n\nNandos- lemme tell you this, pakistans nandos takes the prize of the best nandos around! The depth in menu and the taste is what makes it the best!\n\nDynasty- unfotunately trip to dynasty was marred by sudden bout of sickness, and getting all food packed without even looking- the other disappointment was one of the best hotels in town didnt have panadol in first aid, and the pharmacy hd closed at 9! Made me wonder, wat wud guests do if they needed it in middle of night.\n\nChairman mao- no compromise on quality- still the same good hot n sour soup, chicken schezuan and fried rice!\n\nChatkharay and gazebo- never fail to bring your taste buds alive with the bun kabab, chaat and qeema!\n\nAnddd pompei- blue cheese pizza rocks my socks :)\n\nYummmmm! Just writing abt all these places is making me want them!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-02T18:50:16+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-02T18:50:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"552709635","name":"Tubaa Mansoor"},{"id":"634769006","name":"Nida Mansoor"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"673105463","name":"Fatima Baig"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"1160136117","name":"Shehni Kamran"},{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid"},{"id":"515852871","name":"Wasil Sami Khan"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"514440277","name":"M?ri?

What can one say that has already not been said about this gem of a place. From the moment you enter this restaurant, you are treated like royalty on every visit. \n\nWent there with two friends yesterday that had been craving a good steak for a while and I could not think of a better place than Olivetto. All three of us had the 250 grams of Oli's Rib Eye Steak. To keep it short, it was heaven on a plate for meat lovers like we are ! From the first slice you take out of that steak till the last one, you are in for a juicy treat all the way through ! Very fulling and tastier than any other steak my friends have had here in a long time. Ended up extremely satisfied with it !\n\nWe then were treated to the delicious Chewy Chocolate Brownie, thanks to Afroza aunty which was the perfect dessert to end our dinner for the day !\n\nA special mention to the waiter we were served by yesterday. Was very accommodating and understanding with the issues we were having with one of our tables which he got replaced, twice.\n\nAll in all, one of the best dining out experiences the three of us have had in a very long time ! From the hospitality to the moment we got done with everything, it was all sheer perfection !","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-09T21:24:16+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-11T05:36:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"504392072","name":"Ali Ahmad"},{"id":"1652751344","name":"Rameen Alvi"},{"id":"1322402405","name":"Saqib Raza"},{"id":"524740437","name":"Ahsan Khawaja"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000087144502","name":"Nadia Nadeem"},{"id":"100001822097920","name":"Sara Kazmi"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"538934895","name":"Amad Ul Hasan Siddiqui"},{"id":"100001347983558","name":"Abid Qureshi"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"100001015066425","name":"Sonya Khushi"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ2NjY0NTM4","before":"NTA0MzkyMDcy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"470676492983506","from":{"name":"Abid Qureshi","id":"100001347983558"},"message":"Brilliant It was \u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-10T06:00:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"471148742936281","from":{"name":"Nayab Qureshi","id":"695776393"},"message":"What was that steak called?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-11T05:30:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"471149272936228","from":{"name":"Abid Qureshi","id":"100001347983558"},"message":"Oli's Rib Eye Steak","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-11T05:31:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"471149539602868","from":{"name":"Nayab Qureshi","id":"695776393"},"message":"Oh well it was apparently mentioned above, how did I miss it.

My husband had made the reservation well in advance and thus we were promptly taken care of as soon as we entered the restaurant. The staff was pleasant and courteous without appearing to be excessively concerned or fake. While we scanned the menu and discussed the various options we were served the complimentary bread basket along with seasoned olive oil and the herbed butter. Between the two of us we decided to order 2 appetizers and of course one main course each. So these are the things that we ordered: Mezze Platter, Grilled Tiger Paprika Prawns, Beef Medallion (for me) and Stuff Baked Chicken (for my husband).\n\nOn the whole we found the food to be excellent and the portions to be appropriate. All the dishes including the bread basket were of high standards with the exception of Mezze Platter which was average by the standard of everything else that was served. The Tabouleh was served without any bulgur wheat while both the Hummus and the Mutabel lacked a certain kick. Having said this, in line with the bread basket served to us earlier, the pita breads that came in the platter were perhaps the best that I have had in Karachi. Soft to the extent that they melted in the mouth while soaking in the flavors of the dips that the accompanied. The Paprika Prawns were juicy and succulent and were spiced to perfection. My husband truly enjoyed his chicken and particularly the creamy sauce. For me the star of the evening was the Beef Medallion which I had requested to be medium well and indeed it was medium well. I had also asked our waiter Amjad to replace the mash with steamed and saut?ed vegetables but he was kind enough bring both and I am glad that he did because even though I normally do not each mash potatoes because I find them to be exceedingly heavy, I enjoyed this one as it was light and airy.\n\nAfter we got done with our main courses, we asked for the desert menu and just as we started scanning the menu Mr. Sam GM from Olivetto?s team stepped in and told us that he had already taken care of it and had arranged for a Chocolate Molten Lava on the house in honor of our anniversary. While we waited for it we got a chance to chat with the gentleman himself and enjoyed our brief conversation with him as we touched upon the different ingredients used and the special techniques deployed by the chefs there. The cake was definitely worth the wait as with the first plunge of the spoon the velvety and glossy lava oozed out from the centre of the cake. What I personally also enjoyed was that instead of the usual vanilla ice cream, they served the cake with a toffee/caramel ice cream which was great complement to the chocolate cake.\nAll in all it was a great culinary experience and everything from the food to the service was of high standards. Olivetto is definitely a place that I would like to visit and explore further. Thank you Sam GM for taking great care of us :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-14T16:20:36+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-15T07:27:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002605916001","name":"Sadaf Munir"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"},{"id":"512864890","name":"Scidra Usman"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"690005614","name":"Owais Asif"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"640287493","name":"Mariam Ahmed"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"500616229","name":"Sama Aman"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"676040882","name":"Saniya Shadab"},{"id":"631611761","name":"Adnan Zafar"},{"id":"504592087","name":"Kanwal Anes Ahmed"},{"id":"538934895","name":"Amad Ul Hasan Siddiqui"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTM4OTM0ODk1","before":"MTAwMDAyNjA1OTE2MDAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"460422507342238","from":{"name":"Afroza Bhamani","id":"846664538"},"message":"What a lovely write up!!!

Chicken with smoked tomato sauce with spaghetti was phenomenal and Dj despite being a fastidious person ate all of it, which was enough a proof that it was delicious, I ordered the Herb crusted fish which came with amazing sauce to go with it . . . The Lemon Lime Margarita was in one word EPIC, we both loved it . . .\n\nThe only thing that was a bummer was the dessert, I found the Molten Lava great in the way it looked, the texture and all but the did it hit the right nodes with it?s chocolatiness ? Sadly it didn?t . . . I understand one can?t please all the palates and for a fact mine needs a lot of refinement to go but I found it a little too sweet and kinda Ovaltin-ish/Milo-ish . . . But then neither of us have sweet tooth so we returned happy, satisfied and satiated","type":"status","created_time":"2012-10-30T18:50:40+0000","updated_time":"2012-10-30T20:34:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ2NjY0NTM4","before":"MTA3NjI4NTIxNQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"453657861352036","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Asher Jamal - Thank you for the lovely praise ...

However, the one problem i noticed all three times was that the food kept finishing and wasnt refilled at the right time. Seemed ok in the first week of Ramzan but shuoldve fixed the problem by the last. Oh well.\n- Kolachi - Great food, but tooooooo crowded. Wouldnt bother going for iftar again. Definitely would try it on another day for food.\n- Cafe Blue Ginger - Good food. Rubbish service.\n- Deli - Excellent menu selection and food was really tasty.

The perfection of the pudding clearly overshadowed the richness of Molten Lava Cake and the goodness of Creme Brulee, although they were quite spectacular too.

Our premise was to find a relaxing quiet place where we could catch up on our conversation. So we sat in the lounge which was empty when we arrived. We selected from the lounge deal as we wanted something quick and simple. I took the Beef Burger & Bread Pudding deal while she selected the Grill chicken and Caramel pudding. I was happy with my plate and loved the Bread pudding but just found the helping tad too small esp. after having eaten huge portions at Forty 4 and CBG. Then again it could be because it was part of a deal hence size has been reduced (my own presumption). My friend found the Grill Chicken dry and without seasoning and she requested for some sauce. The server brought her some tarragon sauce and then she said it was much better. Service was good, very effusive and alert. We froze as the guests on our opposite table wanted the AC on full blast and the vent which could not be diverted was directed towards us?eventually we inched away to the right side of the table so we could avoid the blast. (We did mentioned this to the server who apologized and informed us about the vent)  On the whole a relaxing dinner and gupshup.","type":"photo","created_time":"2012-07-19T06:58:09+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-19T11:19:30+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"414488591935630","from":{"name":"Amjad Anwar","id":"100003647628785"},"message":"Thank You mam; Yes this our lounge deal for 539/+, It has a soft drink plus the snack and a dessert.

Had been wanting to try it out for the longest time and was in the mood to eat Chinese so called them up at 8 to see if any tables were free and if they could be reserved. Was told that there would be a table free at 10:30, asked if anything was there earlier he said i can come at 10:15 and confirmed that my reservation is done and he wrote down my name and number. Reached at 10:15 and the place was packed with lots of people waiting and it just kept getting worse, the fellow at the counter said my name and number wasn't written down and they take reservations till 7 and the guy on the phone must have said it just like that. Seriously? Then he said we should wait for 15 minutes and we'll get a table, there was a problem with someone else s reservation too, where they wrote the wrong name by mistake. Anyways kept waiting, 30 minutes passed and the guy at the counter just kept delaying the time and disappeared and sent someone else to handle the people and that person was equally confused. Decided to leave and go to Olivetto where the service was PERFECT and so was the food, had the pepper steak and shikanjabeen and the bread basket was amazing as always!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-06T06:33:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-13T03:40:29+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"513644734","name":"Danish Bhimani"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"530485619","name":"Hana Faisal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTMwNDg1NjE5","before":"NTEzNjQ0NzM0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"409584935759329","from":{"name":"Umme Hamdani","id":"592813967"},"message":"I think ginsoy should just let go of reservations.

Golden Dragon - My new love for Thai and Chinese food. Hot favourites: American Chopsuey, Crispy Beef, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Hot and Sour Soup, Thai Soup, Thai Green Curry, Wontons, Zingers and Chicken Karhai (the last two from their Lunch Xpress section)\n\n2. Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb's warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I'm not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away. Will go soon to be blown away by other things too.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-25T18:59:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-27T14:47:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"505164013","name":"Yasmeen Agad-Kothawala"},{"id":"515396294","name":"Danish Ali Dahraj"},{"id":"100003249618202","name":"Heer Ahmed"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"500907007","name":"Murtaza Moiz"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNjUxNzIy","before":"NjU3MDMxNzQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"404073356310487","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"i see myself featured here too, obliged and humbled Hajra Amir","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T19:33:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir","type":"user","offset":52,"length":10}]},{"id":"404123489638807","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Thank you Hajra :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T21:13:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra","type":"user","offset":10,"length":5}]},{"id":"404386042945885","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"These places are on my fingertips 24/7!!!

I?ve been crazy busy with work the entire week.\n\nSo here is my list of top 10 eateries in Karachi :)\n\n1. The Upper Crust. Don?t think I need to go into the details here. Everything is sheer perfection. \n\n2. Koel Caf? ? When in doubt, just land your tushie at Koel and you will always enjoy phenomenal food, lovely ambience and very courteous service \u003c3\n\n3. BOTS ? again, no need to go into details, for obvious reasons, lol! Delicious food, great delivery service and an absolutely delightful host.\n\n4. Log Inn Lounge ? serves one of the best burgers in town, service is fabulous and the host is a wonderful person. Which is an added bonus for the place that is already doing so well on its food :)\n\nThese are my top 4. Rest of the 6 are fabulous places but I?m only going to list them as I don?t really want to rate them on the top 10 in any particular order. They are all wonderful places that serve great food with impeccable service.\n\n? Olivetto ? love the ambience, love the food even more.\n\n? Grilled Chilliz ? delicious food and great value for money.\n\n? Snack Attack ? a gem not known to many people on this group, in bahadurabad area. They make the best mushroom burgers in town! \n\n? Pizzo ? reviving the concept of great pizzas delivered at home. After the great fiasco that pizza hut has been for many years and domino?s being a huge disappointment, pizzo is like a breath of fresh air.\n\n? Golden Dragon Chinese ? don?t need to say much for them. I think this would be enough: I?ve never been a fan of Chinese food. But GD has totally won me over! \u003c3\n\n? Zahid Nihari, Tariq Road ? deeeeliisshh!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-17T17:16:15+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-19T06:34:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100003034652779","name":"Saher Mukhtar"},{"id":"543405800","name":"Tahir Wahid"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"708482342","name":"Saba Basit"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzA4NDgyMzQy","before":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"399454210105735","from":{"name":"Bilal Alvi","id":"641495625"},"message":"a special mention for Gun Smoke.... the new one is better than the old one \u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T17:17:16+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399463893438100","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"have you tried gbc ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T17:39:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399464043438085","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"and saba do you have a facebook page ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T17:40:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399471693437320","from":{"name":"Mohammad Bin Zia","id":"1137915284"},"message":"Gauher Hashim Please check your inbox.

The service was quick. To add the cherry on top, they gave us 3 perfume samples from Scentsation as it was Father's Day. Upon leaving, there was a team of waiters who thanked us and bid farewell.

Aylanto (yeah it's alphabetical : P) because of freshness of ingredients. and best value for money in fine dining. \n2. BarBQ2night: for its (ISO certified) quality, consistency, cleanliness, & of course their German precision food engineering: P     \n3. CBG: oh this requires an academic thesis, or @least a drawing room discussion, a 1liner is not enough.\n4. Patio: cutesy, warm ambiance, gr8 food and different menu4a change. (no its not alphabetical ;P)\n5. Fujiyama: for the best Japanese in town\n6. Desi: best array of desi flavors under one roof, w/ the good looks & charms of a secret recipe, literally : P\n7. BOTS: best sea food variety under the blue sky, second only to the ocean : P\n8. Log Inn Lounge: for the best chill-out Drinks, food, & conversations on food and of course politics : P\n9. Cafe Gracias: for the best authentic Mexican in town! :P\n10. The upper crust: for having the best fro-yo, panini cheese steaks, belgian chocolate/ RVcake ever.        \n11. The Pakistani at Sheraton- great ambiance, attentive service, love the rose water scented pre-dining hand-rinsing, the post-dining paan and dessert trolley, and a wonderful way to impress family and friends visiting from Abroadzzz.\n12. Crescent Nimco in Bahadurabad- great samosas, chaats, jalebis, chai, kahva, and superb selection of nimco items to take home for when you are feeling like DIY-desi snacks.\n13. This is a tie between Tutti-Fruiti, for its unique self-serve experience and sugar fee varieties, and Berrylicious cuz they are simply sugary-sweet and opening up at Port Grand!\n14. Port Grand- clean and fun atmosphere, with smelly-free views of the harbor, nice walking and shopping, good security, and a decent variety of food for all budgets and tastes. Plus, this allows us to hoot and holler (yeah, i almost became a lawyer, like the loophole?) about Aylanto Bistro and Ghaffar Kabab Hoouse, even though the one in Delhi Mercantile is waaaaay better and more generous!\n15. Dynasty- best Chinese.\n16. Hot n Pepper on Bahria- best malai tikkah rolls. ever!\n17. Butlers- for their 'super-sexxxxy-mocha'- yes, you can go there and ask for it, it's basically extra chocolate syrup..\n18. Olivetto- where else can you get the options for fine-dining or lounge, both with excellent menus?\n19. Koel cafe- for their 'fire and ice' drink, which much like the owner, is the quntissential embodiment of Eastern elegance and taste, met with a certain Western and Worldly sophistication. \n20. The dark brown, unsliced, artisan breads at Hyperstar's bakery. their almond croissants (buttery croissants with actual almond paste inside) too, which are available every now and again on sundays.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-12T08:08:35+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-12T15:46:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"689771441","name":"Riffat Fawad Bukhari"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAyODQxNzU4","before":"NTgyOTYwNTc1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"396668170384339","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Fawad.

Enough said!\n\nTutti fruti Froyo: I love the fact that they keep bringing in new flavors every week. So far, my favourites have been lychee and peach\nBreakfast at Xanders: Tried their soft scrambled eggs, Xanders Club Sandwich, berry daiquiri and strawberry smoothie?absolutely loved the sandwich! I just wish they had pizza in the mornings too. I can have their pizza at all times of the day!\n\nKolachi:  Had heard alot about their makhani handi?taste was alright but left me feeling too heavy?could not have more than a few bites. I really liked the nachos there! The service there deserves special mention. I would definitely go there again.\n\nA One Rolls: Though I used to love the rolls there as compared to eaton, hot and spicy and other roll places, the past couple of times when I went there, the rolls were soggy and extremely oily. \n\nCup a Soup Chicken Laksa at Aghas: I was very hungry (starving actually lol) when I had it and really liked the lemony coconut soup. Would have preferred if it was just a tiny bit more on the sour side as that is the way I?ve had it in Malaysia. A little more punch can make it really Wow! Btw I tried to make it my way at home the next day (just added a little extra imlee ka pani) and it was fabulous!\n\nButlers for lunch today:  Turkey Club Sandwich was good to taste?however, it was falling apart and not too easy to manage. I did not try the spicy chicken sandwich and Butlers Club Sandwich but my friends seemed satisfied with them. The chocolate decadence and hazelnut dessert (oops forgot the name but the dessert itself was pretty forgettable :S!) were fine. I guess I wasn?t in the mood for sweets. \n\nOh I also attended a dinner event at Marriot. Why oh why does the food at 5star hotels have to be so bland????Loved the potato gratin though..just the right amount of cheese and garlic butter..yum!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-09T19:02:29+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-10T09:54:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"753461179","name":"Rohia Zohaib"},{"id":"682241004","name":"Atif Malik"},{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid"},{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"589485566","name":"Murwah Tariq-Atif"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"757449744","name":"Syed Sabih Abbas Razvi"},{"id":"828190023","name":"Shaheen Nouman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODI4MTkwMDIz","before":"NTUyMDA2MTU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"395602850490871","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"\u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T09:54:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzk1NjAyODUwNDkwODcx","before":"Mzk1NjAyODUwNDkwODcx"}}},"restaurantName":"Olivetto"},{"id":"165861103465048_394174767300346","from":{"name":"Rushna Irfan","id":"554760444"},"message":"urgent help!

The waiters were diligent and efficient, the GM was very helpful and the food was very tasty! I had a great time and it was one of the best birthdays ever. Thankyou! :)\n\nAlso, just wanted to add one thing. We had booked their lounge for the event and were supposed to have at least 25 people coming in. Sam (the GM) had given us a per head cost based on that minimum number of people coming in. However, due to some last minute cancellations that people gave us, about 15 people ended up coming. However, Afroza Aunty and Sam were great to not charge us that much extra for the cancellations, which was super duper sweet of them!

I fall more and more in love with it every time I go. Took my mom and sister along today and had a lovely evening. Started off with the complimentary bread basket which is definitely the best in Karachi. Tried the chicken mushroom risotto which was smooth, creamy perfection. It's hard to explain how good it was in words!My sister is a very picky eater and it is very hard to please her but the burger she ordered was a huge hit!The margarita pizza was just the way it should be..with a firm, crispy thin crust.\nThe brownie was good as usual and the bread pudding..ohhh the pudding deserves a separate post of its own. I can never get enough of it. It is truly a work of art.\nWe had stuffed ourselves to the brim when the waiter brought in a complimentary dessert (Did I mention how much I adore the service at Olivetto?).

Our waiter (Javad) is something truly exceptional.  He remembers our names, our favourite dishes, and has yet to tell us \"No\" for any request. \n\nB - They cook probably the finest steaks around town.  Whether you order the medallion, the tenderloin, or the rack of lamb (cheating this isn't a steak); they UNDERSTAND their meat.  Do you want medium rare? They'll give you medium rare.  This is an international standard being upheld.  \n\nC- There has never been an issue with quality.  The standards have always EXCEEDED my expectations. The layout is gorgeous, the temperature is always just right, and they go out of their way to take care of you if come in sick. \n\nD- Pricing is fantastic.  Cafe Flo', Dynasty, and Saffron charge an extra 10% on top of the 16% GST.  This brings the total to a hilarious 26% plus tip.  I've began to notice others following this trend.  Olivetto not only looks the part, but the prices are competitive when competing against the dinosaurs of Karachi Lifestyle dining.\n\nI just want to tip my hat to Afroza Bhamani and Afroze Khan. You have created something truly special.  Please wait for my full review. \n\nI thank you for your time.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-05T07:34:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-05T07:34:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"586043191","name":"Mustafa Mohomedally"},{"id":"100000093496883","name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"1137915284","name":"Mohammad Bin Zia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzNzkxNTI4NA\u003d\u003d","before":"NTA0MDkzOTk3"}}},"restaurantName":"Olivetto"},{"id":"165861103465048_372429649474858","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Adnaan Chaudhary and others were right ... and I was wrong! When people started being negative about Aylanto, I wanted to give them another chance to see if it was really that bad now. Our first experience at the new place was a C+ so I could not understand the horrible reviews they were getting. So, being a glutton for punishment, I took Mariyam Masood there for lunch today. Sigh, what can I say that it was a complete and utter disappointment! First, the positives. Good greeting at the door, polite waiters, cold water, fresh bread and courteous damage control. Unfortunately that is where it stops! Ordered the French Onion soup which actually was not too bad the last time but microscopic cheese on two pieces of french bread thrown in at the last minute so they were hard. When I sent it back, because at the time of the order I specified that I wanted it to be smothered in melting cheese, it returned with some additional grated but unmelted cheese. Strike One! Mariyam's Tarragon Chicken, which she loved at the old Aylanto, was two skinny pieces of chicken unable to really remain juicy or retain flavour. Strike Two! My steak was ordered medium rare and came medium well. Was replaced with one that was more like medium but by then I did not want to waste any more time or food and dutifully ate the average tasting steak. Strike Three! To their credit, one of their managers came to check when he had been told I was unhappy with our food and I shared my concerns with him. He was very apologetic and despite my repeated requests to the contrary, removed the soup and steak from the bill ... which made me very uncomfortable since that was not my intent in speaking with him. I told him that they really need to focus on their food if they are to stem the negative tide and he was receptive to the feedback. He requested that we return and he would personally take charge of our orders. However, unfortunately that is not what we want from any restaurant. Sure, people do take care of us at places we go to but then that is in their nature for ALL their customers, not just us. Overall, being a charitable person, I hope that they can return to the standards of yesteryear because at the moment, I find it very hard to point myself in the direction of Aylanto again. And that is a damn shame since I did enjoy my occasional visits there. The top management and owners have to take charge and do something because even a blind guy like me can see the problems screaming at me! Sorry Aylanto, I really am. I wanted to be positive and see hope but since things are sliding since my last visit, there is genuine cause for concern.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-04T10:18:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-04T18:07:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"603103229","name":"Danish Munir"},{"id":"698366264","name":"Ahsan R.

Went to Olivetto for the first time on the recommendations of the SWOT'ties, thank you guys. From the moment we walked into Olivetto we were greeted by the General Manageress, who personally looked after us through out our dinner with her very well trained staff with proper etiquette, been analyzing the service industry for sometime now, and I have never come across such immaculate service, the ambiance was totally in contrast with the theme of the restaurant  which portrayed a serene dinning experience. The starters especially their tomato soup was divine, never had such tasty tomato soup ever. Every dish in the main course lived up to the expectation from the place, the steaks, the fish, pasta, and the chicken were all mouth watering delicious. Sorry, Afroze forgot to take down the names of the dishes from your staff. The TAT (turn around time) was exceptional, we ordered the food at 9:40, and within 7 minutes we were served with the starters, the time difference between each course was remarkably exceptional with everyone being served their respective dishes simultaneously. \nIf I were to rate the three factors of the dinning experience which are Ambiance, service and food, it is very difficult to figure which one gets the highest ranking, the entire service delivery commitment perfectly were in sync and complimented each other. Rating on the scale I would give Olivetto experience a delightful one which is the highest on the Likert scale of rating service providers. I would also like to personally thank Afroze Khan for making it the best dinning experience in Karachi. Value for money exceptional. Wish Olivetto all the success in their business.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-21T18:52:31+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-22T16:40:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"},{"id":"1640895663","name":"Javaria Javed"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"711344798","name":"Wajeeha Zaidi"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjkzNTk4MzU0","before":"MTAwMDAwMjQ1MDc0MTk1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"300803769970780","from":{"name":"Rehan Shakur","id":"100000128733524"},"message":"Here you go...\n\n        2 tenderloin steaks with baked potato and sauteed vegetables\n        1 Spicy hummor fish\n        1 pan seared becti\n        1 penne al Arrabiata\n        1 Olivetto special pasta\n        1 pizza Margherita\n        1 Moroccan chicken\n\n        The desserts were 2 Italian bread puddings and 1 Belgian chocolate brownie [:-)]\n\n        I hope you all enjoyed your evening.

Last Sunday after a botched up plan for brunch.. I called up O.E. And ordered my 3 usual dishes, 2 of which were not satisfactory. So I commented here and posted my review. Just 30 mins bak I get a call from O.E. Apologizing for the unsatisfactory dishes I had received and was offered both of them complimentary whenever I desired. I asked the person on the phone who had seen my post and was given the name of Mr. Saleem. I asked if I could speak to the gentleman if he was present.....I thanked Mr. Saleem for the apology and the very kind offer but I told him I would NOT accept the food and that it was not nesseary. Just the apology itself was enough. Told him that it was the first time in yrs that I had a complaint for their food and they have not lost a customer and that i will order from them again in the future. Oh....And it's good to know they will be going bak to their origional packaging.  NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-20T15:10:52+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-21T17:48:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501066432","name":"Mustafa Mumtaz"},{"id":"100000391823197","name":"Farah S.

We ordered the Mezzah Platter, and as usual 5 star to the platter which was awesome, feta and  olives along with humous my favourite on it! As it was just two of us, by the time we were done with bread and platter, we felt stuffed! because both were soo good! Anyhow, i had already ordered Chicken Roulade. and despite being full, i still managed to eat 70% of it because it was veryyyyyy good! and the frnd ordered Braised Lamb--again a large serving however she thought the taste was slightly bland. But i would also discount that we had quite heavily satiated our taste buds with the starters!\n\nAnd well, this did not leave any place for desserts! But overall as usual after 18months, the Okra experience ws still the same! so three cheers for them!\n\nNight time shift was my initiation to Port Gran with 14 other odd frnds and family frm abroad. and what a place it is!!! amazing! makes me feel even more proud of karachi..:):) And i am already eagerly looking forward to the expansion and addition to the place. There was a live Sindhi Musical cultural performance while we were there, which i thought was a great idea, kept the public very entertained, depicted the culture of Sindh and should be continued as well. For dinner, we landed at Chairman Mao, (being their regular customer in my karachi-days for delivery). Ordred Pizza, and well how much i am a fan of Mao, the pizza tasted very mediocre. We ordered Chicken Tikka pizza, and the pizza had too much of chaat masala! whch kind of lowered the taste! so ws slightly disappointed. Then went for Chickn Manchurian and Chicken in Oyester Sauce, both were fine too, but lacked the 'kick' that i used to get after having a Mao-meal! they tasted like a very ordinary meal from a desi-chinese place. Either Mao's port grand branch hs different recipe, or the quality has just deteriorated slightly.\n\nBut the port Grand experience was marvellous! cant wait to be back next year with even better PG!\n\nTommorow's lunch-- Olivetto!!

My first time there, I was completely taken in by the beautiful decor. dark wooden interior, fresh white flowers, and a very spacious and grand setting. Thank u Afroze Khan for being such a sweet and gracious host! U add so much to the overall Olivetto experience :) \nSeafood chowder was yum with nice chunks of seafood, others had tomato basil & cream of mushroom soup - both passed with flying colors. the mezzeh platter was terrific, the hummus, the tabouleh - WOW. breaded calamari, as Afroze said, is definitely the best in town. Ceaser salad was great too. Sole Meditteranean was a treat to my soul. just a tad bit salty otherwise a perfect 10/10. Chicken stuffed with Feta was delicious in its creamy goodness. Chicken in mushroom sauce was super tasty, with a tinge of garlic in every bite. Creme brule had great consistency. The star of the night was the indulgent bread pudding generously topped with sticky toffee sauce. This delicious dessert was an on the house treat and came with a customized birthday greeting - really made me feel special! Thanks again Afroze for your hospitality!

But obviously he can see the comments and posts. Due to the last post on Xander's he hhas every right to correct the maligning comments so he inboxed me.\n\nI have to admit he makes sense. And all my times at Xander's have been great. Even when I got a creme brulee that could have been better, their service was impeccable.\n\nPlease read the email.\n\"Hi Nezihe, since I'm no longer part of SWOT (i tried to comment to the pizza thing) i can't write back, which is fine. However i wanted to let you know what i was writing as even you seemed to believe what was written. This is nothing against you or SWOT since both have helped me for Xander's. So here it is...\n\nMany of you have not heard from me for a long time on this group...the reason for this is that although I am open to negative feedback (SWOT helped me determine that my food portions in the beginning were too small and helped me improve for example), i have heard even more \"ridiculous\" comments which i know are not true ranging from me the owner telling a customer off and bad-mouthing them because they had not ordered enough or were not willing to wait for a table (??!!) or my best and most trusted waiter throwing his pen and pad on the floor and storming off after arguing with a customer (CCTV footage shows that it never happened) etc etc. Unfortunately, my camera does not have a view of the pizza station, however, for those who wish to listen to me, i would like to say that these pizza's are being made on a trial basis and the 3 pizza's given to customers that day were sent under MY supervision, which means i was there throughout. I know, that my cook who has had experience working infront of guests before would never ever in his wildest dreams think of \"spitting\" on a pizza let alone \"blow\" on it before serving it. I may come across as arrogant by not believing a word of this, but i know that there's not even the slightest chance of that happening. Furthermore, how could a pizza that has caught fire and therefore charred and become black be served to a customer infront of the owner? This conversation can drag on, but i found it necessary to intercept this one time and explain. For those who don't believe me thats fine. I respect SWOT tremendously, for the constructive criticisms and feedbacks which help us restauranteurs improve our service and quality. However, sometime these have been distorted and exaggerated to proportions where one cannot take everything that is commented seriously!\"","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-17T18:47:03+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-18T13:19:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000519917560","name":"Fizza Shahid"},{"id":"1655946149","name":"Imtiaz Merchant"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"100002928478909","name":"Rabia Ahmed"},{"id":"1481817950","name":"Naila Naqvi"},{"id":"617680709","name":"Fatima Ali Rizvi"},{"id":"508588993","name":"Saroasha Eng"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002605916001","name":"Sadaf Munir"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"505248635","name":"Tanya Azmi"},{"id":"1039048992","name":"Camilla Asmatullah"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"764425006","name":"Alisa Zulfiqar Zuberi"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100000226398562","name":"Irum Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwMjI2Mzk4NTYy","before":"MTAwMDAwNTE5OTE3NTYw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"298225660228591","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Alex you know the Tariff requirement for you to be back on the page.

China Kitchen.............. Here is the low down. I took the set menu (thank god for simplicity) Started with Hot and Sour soup, Wonderful smoky taste, adorned with Tofu, ginger and Shitake mushrooms. Brilliant, as good as any soup in a decent New York restaurant. Then came the wontons, crisp with a plum sauce.The most amazing dish was the fried squid, covered with sechuan pepper, tiny diced chillies was pure heaven. Moist, flavourful, balanced with shrimp. Awesome. Then the crispy beef in a noodle nest. Once again the tang of orange peel, the sweetness the crisp crunch. Then came the mind blowers. The black pepper beef, was moist tender chunks of beef, delicate, juicy and tender, like top sirloin. Spotted Ayaz of Okra  dining next to us. The tender chunks of chicken in a tangy sesame sauce.  The Sechuan fish was awesome. I do not praise restaurants much, usually I am underwhelmed. BUT.... China Kitchen has done something that few will appreciate, they have REDEFINED the ketchupy food we have come to expect from Chinese restaurants. The food, the service was Awesome....

However the quality of food and service detoriated so bad so soon..held a management dinner there mid Dec, the food tasted below average and the waiters stank. They somehow were adament on removing plates before we could finish our food and were bending over our heads to do so. We complained multiple times but no use. In starters, the calamari was stale and not crunchy as usual, the salads lacked seasoning and were dry, only wontons were the saviours. In main course, the spicy lemon fish was bland, the shrimps were overcooked, the glass noodles tasted really odd with only dominant red chilli flavour, spicy red chicken & sweet & sour chicken were only decent entrees. Creme brulee in dessert was a major disappointment for whoever ordered it. They lost good 10 potential and 4 existing customers that day! i hope they recover soon.. till next good review from anyone its off my list!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-10T12:57:55+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-11T07:29:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"677666360","name":"Fazal Gafur"},{"id":"728371533","name":"Ismaa Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzI4MzcxNTMz","before":"Njc3NjY2MzYw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"293659717351852","from":{"name":"Shafia Agha","id":"650845003"},"message":"bee, you should have gone to Pompei.. :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T13:13:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293674054017085","from":{"name":"Benish Omair","id":"512153949"},"message":"Yup sent the team to Pompei next day..but I had high hopes from forty4 :(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T13:46:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293682410682916","from":{"name":"Ismaa Khan","id":"728371533"},"message":"Going to wait for the green light from you, Benish before we head there.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T14:05:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293699430681214","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100001014475620"},"message":"yes the ambience is veryyy nice they need to work better on their food","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T14:46:53+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293879597329864","from":{"name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha","id":"584682243"},"message":"went there last night and the food was good! 7 of us and everyone loved what they got...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T20:25:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"294198240631333","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"There are still more bad reviews than good ones  and the stinky waiters clinched it for me.

Beautiful ambiance, perfect place for a quiet dinner, loved the lighting and the decor. \nService was exceptional, loved how Afroze Khan kept checking in on us and also gave us her input on our order, never have been treated so well at a restaurant in Karachi. Ordered the Beef Carpaccio, which I was not aware is the equivalent of sushi only with meat. Let's just say had I known I wouldn't have ordered, because I liked my food cooked. The bread basket was unbelievable. I had earlier read someone asking the Olivetto team how they keep the bread so warm and soft even after it arriving at the table, and that's exactly what I was wondering after every bite. For the main course we ordered the Moroccan Chicken and the Beef Tuscan. Both were extremely delicious,  did not lack flavor or taste. The serving sizes were way above what the average restaurants offer. I was full half way during the meal so I got it to go. Then came the desserts, the Chocolate Molten Lava and a complimentary bread pudding. Both desserts were heaven. But again had a small amount because I was already full, so got that to go aswell. Only hiccup you might say was that they didn't have the much talked about Pizza's available, which I was dying to have. But I guess that's a good thing because, now I can go back very soon for that. Thank you Team Olivetto.\n\nNext night decided to go with the bois to TUC. Was craving for the U.S Supreme burger, and it did not disappointing at awwl. Ahh, it was as juicy as Megan Fox. Very consistent taste. This time had it with the bran bun which was fresher than the white bun I had last time. Told the waiter to hold the coleslaw, because last two times I ended up wasting it because I don't like it, who took the instructions well.

My mother and I are still in awe because it was such a brilliant experience!\nThe service was impeccable! Afroze Khan, thank you for being so courteous and helpful, it was a pleasure being around you :)!\nThe servers were at their best and timed our 3 course meal perfectly. Nothing was lacking :). \nOk so we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly with a 3 course meal which left us stuffed like Turkeys ourselves :). \nFor starters: Marg and Smoked Chicken split pizza and Artichoke and Spinach Dip.. What a brilliant start!! The pizza was the BEST I have had in town and mom agrees. And the dip was just to die for! All of this accompanied by their brilliant freshly baked bread basket and veggies with the most amazing sour cream dip!\nFor our main course we ordered 2 different Turkey dishes. The Classic Roasted Turkey and the Turkey Roulade. Both were absolutely superb! The trimmings were so fantastic that I really couldn't stop eating no matter how full I was. The stuffing in particular was amaaaaazing!! We got a heap of steamed veggies along with our meal. The french beans and broccoli completed the dish for me! Crisp and tasty!\nFor dessert we were thinking of having the Creme Brulee (because it's absolutely delicious) but decided to go with the Molten Chocolate cake instead since we hadn't tried that yet. And it was seriously the perfect, sweetest ending! Ooh dear was it good!!\n\nI just wish we had Christmas dinner 365 days round because I'd make it a point to go once a week without fail. \nWhat a meal!!\n\nThank you for this brilliant addition to Karachi Afroza aunty! Can't wait to come back again :)!","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-31T12:59:11+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-08T06:11:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"706330942","name":"Kashan Yaqoob"},{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"100002594564883","name":"Tania Ali Raza"},{"id":"1842333707","name":"Farheen Faroqui"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzA4MDI1NDkx","before":"NzA2MzMwOTQy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"287586781292479","from":{"name":"Afroza Bhamani","id":"846664538"},"message":"Thank You Aamina; You Sarah and your mom are really kind!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-31T13:30:08+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"289241744460316","from":{"name":"Afroze Khan","id":"1053828627"},"message":"Come back and grace us with your presence soon now ladies...always a pleasure seeing you :-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-03T11:12:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"289248374459653","from":{"name":"Aamina Jahangir","id":"501859943"},"message":"I'm looking forward to it Afroze!

The smoked turkey salad with pasta was absolutely fabulous.  Also ordered the feta cheese salad and the mezzeh.  Both really delicious.  Thin crust smoked chicken pizza was my main course but also share the spicy  hummour which was outstanding.  Also tried the creme br?l?e for the first time a there which was served with a freshly baked cinnamon cookie.  One of the finest creme br?l?e I've had in recent times. On my special request the dessert chef of Olivetto made a really bitter chocolate lava which went very well with vanilla ice cream.  Friends with me were very happy with their main courses, pasta with spinach, jumbo tiger prawns, Moroccan chicken and baked stuffed chicken.  Yer another great experience in fine dining.

Went to Olivetto for lunch with all the elves and father Christmas. The kids loved the beautiful christmas tree at the entrance with all its tinsel and ornaments. The warm breadbaskets melted away in our mouths  as soon as they were placed on the table. Then came the starters: salmon with caviar and turkey something pasta. One word guys; DEVINE, just sorry i had to share it with the rest :(  \nOfcourse christmas lunch would be incomplete without turkey. Having eaten turkey many times, I know that its meat can get pretty dry. But not the case today, the turkey slices were moist and perfecto, with yum sides of veges, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and gravy. My son, the rebel, ordered the lamb and had us tukeyites all drooling over his plate as well. Each was attacking the other's plate. So much for teaching the kids etiquettes of fine dinning.  Just imagine all this with festive holiday music in the background. :) Although we were stuffed to the brim, the creme brule-vanilla, coffee and blueberry floated to our mouths with shortbread pieces of heaven. The little ones enjoyed their brownie with ice cream (thanks Afroze Khan). Oops I didn't mention the tantalizing drinks. We ordered the sikanjabeen, pina con nada, apple and orange juice and ...my son, the master orderer hit the jackpot with the passion fruit smoothie. I kept snatching his drink, and scolding him for not letting me have a sip or few. Next time he's ordering for me. Thanks Olivetto for giving us such a wonderful experience. All that was missing was warm apple cider and a fire place.

We settled on Xander's since a couple of people have recommended it and it has a courtyard where we could sit outside and the little one could putter around. As it turns out the courtyard was swarming with flies so that was a non-starter and we moved indoors. The decor was nice and the staff courteous and friendly. My daughter loved the Christmas Tree and got a complimentary chocolate which she scarfed down in no time. I was a little disappointed with the menu selection which seemed limited and at first I couldn't really find anything that took my fancy, however when a couple of plates of fish and chips wafted by for the neighbouring table, both my wife and I were tempted since it looked like genuine battered english-style fish and chips.\n\nThe service was swift, but as it turns out the fish was very poor. It just tasted off somehow (my wife claimed one of the pieces she got tasted fine so it may have been the fish was a bit old - I'm not sure) and the tartar sauce was also strangely sour - I'm not sure if that was because of something in it or it was also getting on in age. The quantity of the fish was nothing to write home about but since neither of us liked it that wasn't an issue. The fries were standard mon salwa type stuff and in good quantities. We regretted not getting different dishes, though as I said earlier I wasn't too impressed by the diversity of the selection. We unanimously decided to forgo desert at Xander's and go elsewhere instead (ended up going to Hotspot where the desert was great as usual but the experience slightly spoilt by a table-full of 14 year-old girls smoking like chimneys).\n\nBut as it turns out our troubles at Xander's weren't over. I paid by credit card but was told by the cashier that they were getting an error and it wasn't charged. So I paid in cash but then checked my phone to see I had received an sms from the credit card company saying it had been charged. I showed the msg to the staff who said I should ignore it since it hadnt been charged. I called the card people who confirmed it had been and informed the staff. To cut a long story short it took over 20 minutes to sort the matter out by which time the kids were going stir-crazy and I had a splitting headache. The problem probably wasn't the staff's fault and they were courteous throughout but it made the whole experience all the more disappointing. When my wife asked me later if I'd ever want to go again I thought I wouldn't completely rule out the idea but probably not for a full meal.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-25T11:26:15+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-26T06:46:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1359810443","name":"Nuria Munir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM1OTgxMDQ0Mw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTM1OTgxMDQ0Mw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"283942944990196","from":{"name":"Nida Huq","id":"850419690"},"message":"I agreed with you.

Didn't know Olivetto also did a buffet type dinner.  Was really impressed.  The Lounge portion of Olivetto was reserved for the GT.  Choice of chicken cream and tomato soups followed by 3 starters (margarita pizza slices, cheese on crackers with olives and spicy prawns on toast) were passed around.  The buffet was awesome, mediterranean salad (amazing with sun dried tomatoes, feta cheese, olives), hummour in Mediterranean sauce, fillet of beef in pepper sauce, penne al arabiatta, prawn risotto, chicken in creamy mushroom sauce and Mediterranean rice. All the main courses were really delicious.  Desserts included cream caramel, italian bread pudding and vanilla ice cream. Olivetto did a great job.  It was one helluva buffet dinner.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-20T19:48:14+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-21T05:56:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"500293260","name":"Aamir Basrai"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1039048992","name":"Camilla Asmatullah"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nzc3NjQ3ODAy","before":"MTAwMDAyNjY4OTYxNDAz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"281285578589266","from":{"name":"ArtScene Galleries","id":"1463201564"},"message":"loved d food..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T19:50:09+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281287281922429","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"Great selection of menu, feeling hungry at this time after reading.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T19:53:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281288708588953","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"FF, maybe u can go to Olivetto and check out any leftovers.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T19:54:24+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281289541922203","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"AAM I don't expect leftover as Shahzad Artscene was also there ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T19:55:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281291298588694","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"The food was so yummy Farhan that Olivetto beats any Karachi eatery hands down.

Bland food, value for money, a little extra, small things to complete a dish and personalized service are VERY IMPORTANT to make a new joint take off.My advice to restaurant owners is don't look at reaping back what you have sown the first day the restaurant opens, give it some time, twelve to eighteen months, give it your best shot, establish yourself in the market, address customer complaints, make changes and woo customers, who may be disgruntled and not completely satisfied. We have seen so many success stories, which had quite some negative reviews early, like CBG, like Olivetto, Okra, Cafe 9, The Deli, and many others, their owners and management took pains and worked hard to redefine their image and achieve success and carve a niche for themselves. The owners and operators of Cafe 44 and Xanders need to realize that Rome was certainly not conquered in one day and customer is the King, the only way that they can achieve success is continuous evolution and improvement. We can SWOT it anytime but the owners and management should commits to fine tuning and bring themselves up to the required level. I hope this topic stands concluded from critique point of view.

The quantity of rice they served with it was perfect for me (I prefer smaller portions) but wld probably not be enuff for most ppl. The chicken and veggie helping on the other hand is verry generous so I for one was quite full and satisfied :) Had the shikanjbeen to wash it all down and it reminded me that Koel does the best shikanjbeen in town. Packed with minty freshness! Since we were a group of 6 ppl in serious need of comfort food we ordered 3 desserts. But before that the waiter surprised us with cinnamon and cardamom tea on the house which was sweet of them. The hot beverage also helped make room for the desserts ;) Tried their banoffee pie for the first time and it is to die for! Scrrrumptous! The baked chocolate pudding was also perfect. Unlike most places where the pudding is overcooked and only a small trickle of chocolate sauce oozes out, this one was a perfect combo of a crisp crust that oozes a volcano of molten chocolate the minute u attack it. Delicious! Sadly their creme brulee was disappointing and not as good as Olivetto's. All in all though I enjoyed a lovely meal and ambience along with great service. 'Tis the season for Koel for sure I'd say ;)","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-15T20:21:55+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-16T05:55:58+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzMzcxOTYzMA\u003d\u003d","before":"MTQ0MjI3MTY4Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"278496285534862","from":{"name":"Humayun Farooq","id":"648616217"},"message":"Wah wah","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-15T20:53:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"278707378847086","from":{"name":"Sadia Shah","id":"527315314"},"message":"Wah wah indeed:p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-16T05:18:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"278718375512653","from":{"name":"Ali Raza Pir","id":"515674780"},"message":"love koel","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-16T05:55:58+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mjc4NzE4Mzc1NTEyNjUz","before":"Mjc4NDk2Mjg1NTM0ODYy"}}},"restaurantName":"Olivetto"},{"id":"165861103465048_275363109181513","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"Had an amazing evening at Olivetto....the food was divine....tarragon chicken was really yummie, and the bread chunks from the bread basket was really soft and tasted good.

Excellent food.  No complaints about the service except that the olive oil and balsamic vinegar was brought to the table a few minutes after the bread basket was served and by that time we had already attacked the bread basket and finshed all of it.  Another bread basket however followed.  Had a full red meat meal - Beef Carpaccio (i always thought that Flo made the best beef carpaccio but this one was as good as what's available at Flo) and Pepper Steak (asked for medium and got a medium) 300 gms excellent piece of cow meat which i really enjoyed - one of the finest steaks i've had in the recent times.  All at our table went home very happy with the quality of food.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-14T19:34:19+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-14T20:01:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"734228975","name":"Rizwan Mustafa Yusuf"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4","before":"NzM0MjI4OTc1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"277909272260230","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"they have excellent salads and fish - you are going for a kebab and nihari dinner tomorrow\n\ni dont want to know whats your cholestrol level!!!!!!! yikes","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:37:06+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"277909442260213","from":{"name":"Najia Omer","id":"100001697733780"},"message":"we never got a bread basket!! i think the presentation of food is horrible at olivetto, taste was okay nothing amazing.. but seriously presentation was beyond horrible, i think it matters alot!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:37:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"277910698926754","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"cholestoral level is within the required normal range  Nezihe Hussain.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:39:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain","type":"user","offset":55,"length":14}]},{"id":"277910848926739","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"kitne ki bet lugi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:39:33+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"277910962260061","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Aalia Mahboob Elahi - care to answer that","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:39:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1048742368","name":"Aalia Mahboob Elahi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":19}]},{"id":"277911368926687","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"jitne ki bet lagani hai laga lo - its 157.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:40:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"277911782259979","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"i dont believe it - whose blood did you giv","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:41:18+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"277912302259927","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"my own, the docs also were surprised, asked to repeat and same result.  no one believes it Nezihe Hussain","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:42:01+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain","type":"user","offset":91,"length":14}]},{"id":"277914075593083","from":{"name":"Khalid Lakhani","id":"711077848"},"message":"Abid Aziz Merchant, didn't you announce you were on a fruit diet till tomorrow???","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-14T19:45:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"840619510","name":"Abid Aziz Merchant","type":"user","offset":0,"length":18}]},{"id":"277914175593073","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Najia Omer, that's very strange, i've always got a bread basket at Olivetto and the presentation was perfect.

I have noticed this in fries made in my home also. This is, ofcourse, a personal opinion and I am sure there are many exceptions to this, such as yourself. Also, the imported fries are an indulgence for me and I quite enjoy the personal decadence. But, in all fairness, I will also add that I love good food but I can't cook / fry / boil anything myself so maybe its a technical thing.

We ordered the potato and leek soup which was rich and creamy, just the way I like it. There was also a slightly zesty flavor in the soup, perhaps lemon, but I'm not too sure. The tartness just added more flavor to the soup. For our main course we ordered Sole Mediterranean and the Chicken and Mushroom Risotto. The fish was decent, flavour and portion wise, although a better presentation could undoubtedly help. The risotto was delicious and the portion is fantastic, although a little too creamy/buttery for my liking. We ordered fresh lime with 7-up for drinks; we were initially served flat 7-ups, but they promptly replaced the drinks once we complained. The only real issue was that the lights kept flickering, I'm not sure if this is intentional or if voltage was an issue yesterday, but it was a slight annoyance.  A good night overall :)","type":"status","created_time":"2011-11-30T05:41:26+0000","updated_time":"2011-11-30T09:31:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"820702279","name":"Farhan Siddiqui"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"1249052648","name":"Shirin Ali Khan"},{"id":"559841066","name":"Saba Hussain"},{"id":"61308574","name":"Owais Ali"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQwNjE5NTEw","before":"ODIwNzAyMjc5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"269007923150365","from":{"name":"Afroza Bhamani","id":"846664538"},"message":"Thank You Komal Tauqeer; there was a huge power failure in our block and we shifted to generators after that..
