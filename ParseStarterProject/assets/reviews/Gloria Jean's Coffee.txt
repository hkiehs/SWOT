The queue had almost 910-11 people in waiting, and there were only 5 minutes to iftar. Considering how long the queue was, people started yelling and the manager disrespectfully said \"its closed we are not serving you may all go!\" with not even a gram of empathy or anything.\n\nIf you can't serve the people why let them sit there and wait in the queue for almost an hour.If your kitchen hasn't done prep for people you might as well close down the place or tell them you aint serving when they are entering.\n\nThankfully ESPRESSO downstairs was courteous enough to have us seated at their place at last minute and quickly made arrangements for 5 of us.
