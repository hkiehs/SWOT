I ordered their Rowtisserie chicken for dinner last night which to my utter dismay was bland and peeled off from the top. Since me and my Mom were very hungry, we quickly had it but I felt the need to inform them as my previous experience was great and I did not want them to compromise on the quality of food for their future customers. I spoke to their customer service; apprised him about how the meal was not up to the mark and also the fact that the food was served cold. He politely listened to me and quickly said to give him few minutes so that he could trace my previous order. In no time, he called me and offered me a complete replacement of the meal also adding that I should probably opt for the flame grilled chicken this time as its more flavoursome compared to Rowtisserie so I agreed. The food arrived and just tasted right (yummy infact), the way I had experienced it the very first time with their scrumptious dilli potatoes and the hot brown pita bread. \n\nRowtisserie customer service over here deserves a 'special mention'. This is how customer service should be, about bringing customers back and making them happy - the ability to hear to feedback, be helpful and courteous which unfortunately some of our food chains customer departments truly lack.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-16T21:35:57+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-16T21:35:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"704090604","name":"Kamran Qureishi"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"},{"id":"1031959405","name":"Azka Rehman"},{"id":"1378992112","name":"Sarah Siddiqi"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"508578177","name":"Wafa Umer"},{"id":"694982863","name":"Warisha Usman"},{"id":"644528865","name":"Shirin Imani"},{"id":"100002937028856","name":"Mazhar Soni"},{"id":"759025230","name":"Hassan Jan"},{"id":"623971556","name":"Imran Ahmed"},{"id":"567175539","name":"Maha Laka"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"513558813","name":"Khozema Soni"},{"id":"753720620","name":"Sharmeen R.

Hoping that they row across the Mediterranean, introduce Gyros, and just nail the flavor!\n\nRow all the way.\n\nOverall Rating -- 7/10 (mainly because of the Flame Grilled Chicken)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-22T20:27:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-24T16:30:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"724148371","name":"Rabia Hai"},{"id":"1590802896","name":"Farri Khalid"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"},{"id":"100006519972294","name":"Ali Raza Q"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"797675206","name":"Javeria Usmani"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Yes, yes, I know. Abhi tak try nahin kiya tha, but better late than never, right? So we ordered both the flame-grilled quarter chicken and the Row chicken, also quarter. Along with it came the assortment of pickles and sauces, white pita, and the roasted garlic and tomato soup, which was the soup of the day.\nThe soup was a wonderful surprise. Peppery, sweet with the roasted garlic, with proper tomatoey texture and just the right amount of sour to go with the sweetness of the garlic and the heat from the black pepper, this is not a soup for the fainthearted! If you prefer the weak, watered down, ketchupy versions of our local tomato soup, please refrain from trying this soup out. One can tell when 'propah propah' tomatoes have been used in a soup. This was the duchess of 'propah'. \nEverything was flavorful, and had that slow roast, tender, juicy yummy chicken love coming through. The Row sauce did remind me a bit of the Nandos sauces, but somehow better, less spicy and tangy, yet more robust and well-rounded in flavor. \nThe pickles were fresh, crunchy, vinegary deliciousness.  The pita bread, thicker than I would have preferred, and was cast aside after the first bite, since it diluted and cut back the flavors of the chicken. \nDespite the higher price pointing, I would definitely go back for more of Rowtisserie.

I had both steam chicken and flamed grilled one. Not much of a difference, guess its personal choice what to opt for. Both the chicken flavours were to the core, perfectly tender, no blackened skin and proportion smaller (if compared to Nandos). Sideline Mash potato, rice and corn all of them were good but serving them on flat plate made them cold quicker. We had chocolate Eclair as desert, pastry was hard, cream didn't feel fresh & light so I had better then this. Now the price or value for money I would rate 6/10. If you compare it with Nandos where quarter chicken is Rs240 then they servinf for Rs425 (though it is served with garlic sauce, row sauce, tabouleh, pickle & pita) but still this shouldn't increase the price so much. To dine-in the place is pretty tiny with not so comfortable sitting. So an overall experience 7.5/10 and i'll being good there again too!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-31T13:43:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-31T15:43:10+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"740378859","name":"Hira Ahmed"},{"id":"571527018","name":"Sana Abid Khan"},{"id":"517470504","name":"Nida Ali"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"571357266","name":"Khurram Zameer"},{"id":"512542175","name":"Nabiya Fahad Khan"},{"id":"1277228905","name":"Rehan Ahmad Khan"},{"id":"100000416623123","name":"Imran Ali"},{"id":"668642026","name":"Talha Shahid"},{"id":"648030060","name":"Tazeen Ali"},{"id":"716506757","name":"Amaan Aziz Zuberi"},{"id":"635343410","name":"Haroon Khan"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

I had been craving chicken all day hence decided to order Rowtisserie chicken, reason being I don't like Damascus's overly salted chicken and was not in the mood for Nandos. Also I had only ordered from Rowtisserie one time when they had opened and the chicken came in 1.5 hours and was dry despite that I thought I'd give them another shot.\n\nI ordered the Rower's Meal II which included half a rotisserie chicken, Row sauce, Garlic sauce, Tabouleh, pickles, Pita bread, 2 sides of my choice and two drinks. I chose mash & gravy and hummus plus an additional heavy garlic sauce.\n\nThe order taker had told me 40 to 45 minutes for delivery so I expected at least an hour but to my surprise the food was delivered in 30 ! My grumbling tummy couldn't be more thankful.\n\nThe chicken was small but succulent, moist and not overly seasoned, just the right amount of spices gave it that wonderful flavour.  The mash & gravy was very creamy and delicious but I think the gravy could use beef stock in it. My favourite part was dipping the chicken in the Row sauce and then the garlic sauce both extremely flavourful....I'm salivating just by typing this ! The Tabouleh was fresh and a perfect accompaniment to the meal. The Hummus was the only thing I didn't like, it was too pungent and not smooth in flavour, also I would have liked an olive garnishing on top. The pita was fresh, I gobbled it up with the extra garlic sauce I had ordered. I was left feeling happy and satiated.\n\nKeeping in mind three things, taste, quality and service, I give them 8.5 /10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-19T16:10:10+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-20T05:35:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"647150297","name":"Mehreen Faisal"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NjQ3MTUwMjk3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"543415832376238","from":{"name":"Kashif Malim","id":"766095724"},"message":"Do you have a link to their page or website?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:15:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543429935708161","from":{"name":"Sana Sultan","id":"1519922458"},"message":"https://www.facebook.com/Rowtisserie?fref\u003dts","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:22:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543430325708122","from":{"name":"Kashif Malim","id":"766095724"},"message":"Thanks Sana :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:24:01+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1519922458","name":"Sana","type":"user","offset":7,"length":4}]},{"id":"543435195707635","from":{"name":"Mohsin Makki","id":"667511058"},"message":"sana for how much?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:42:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543445595706595","from":{"name":"Sana Sultan","id":"1519922458"},"message":"1345/-","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T17:20:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543455882372233","from":{"name":"Mohsin Makki","id":"667511058"},"message":"not bad :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T17:53:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543752059009282","from":{"name":"Hassan Farook","id":"621215659"},"message":"as you have mentioned that you did skip 2 of your meals I am sure it would have tasted better","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-20T05:35:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNzUyMDU5MDA5Mjgy","before":"NTQzNDE1ODMyMzc2MjM4"}}},"restaurantName":"Rowtisserie"},{"id":"165861103465048_542192945831860","from":{"name":"Zeenat Bayat","id":"1567299507"},"message":"Came across the cutest little cafe on 14th street called Rowtisserie.

Ordered a full chicken meal and a half chicken, side lines of hummus, roast potatoes and white pita. Food arrived after an hour and a half after being told at time of order that it would take 35-40 minutes. Chicken was luke warm (my son wants to write 'stone cold')- any case, it took away immensely from the flavour. The chicken could've been juicier too and tasted a tad on the dry side. The potatoes were stone cold though and had to be reheated in the micro...i don't mind cold roasted potatoes but these were not quite cooked all the way through and had to be reheated for that purpose too. They tasted fine. The pita was fluffy and soft. We got a mixed delivery of white and brown even though we'd requested for just white. Hummus, sauces and other condiments were lovely. I would've loved a hot harissa type of sauce to go along with it, but that's a personal preference. All in all, an okay experience. I appreciate it's a new business and there will be teething issues. Hopefully they'll get resolved quickly. Will I order again? Er, i think i'll wait for the dine-in option so i can sink my teeth into a hot juicy piece of chicken like the name Rowtisserie conjures up.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-23T18:19:22+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-25T08:51:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"525839244133897","from":{"name":"Aqueel Haji","id":"749767604"},"message":"Extremely dissapointed with the experience!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-23T18:24:48+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"525856484132173","from":{"name":"Fatimah Jameel","id":"714178973"},"message":"My food was fantastic tonight.

Much to our amusement we got a free meal and by the time  our plates arrived we were famished. The Roasted chicken was quite delicious and fresh. There were tons of take away orders so I guess there may have been a few delays since it was their first day..Kamil humbly apologised and we decided to condone our delay. However, The size of the qtr chicken was rather small which Kamil also noted and even offered to have a another piece \"on the house\" but the helpings of the mezze platter had aleady sufficed.

The chicken was cooked well and while it wasn't hot, it was well wrapped in foil so it wasn't too bad. The chicken was not as moist as I expected but with the dipping sauces, ended up being a reasonably good main course. Pita bread was fine and generous in quantity. There were some good dipping sauces and salsa style of veggies that were tasty. \n\nThe sides were generally disappointing in their \"averageness\". The roasted potatoes were dry and not particularly appealing. The mash and gravy were fine but nothing special. The hummus was just alright in taste but given that it is the most expensive side on the menu, the quantity was really miniscule and the taste should have been more impressive. \n\nAll in all, no actual complaints about the food, but overall it just didn't compare particularly favorably to the traditional alternatives available. Maybe the food would have tasted better at the restaurant or will improve with the passage of time from adjustments due to consumer feedback and experience.  Would love to keep hearing what others are saying since we only tried one major item on the menu and there may be other things worth tasting.\n\nFor about 2200 bucks, I did expect a higher standard of taste but again, it may just take a little time for things to settle down since this is such a new establishment. We'll just have to give it some time and try Rowtisserie again to see if things are any better. However, I will say that they seem to have responded well to the initial delivery time issues so maybe there is hope for the rest!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-24T17:46:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-24T18:51:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNDU2MDU5MDk1","before":"ODQwNjE5NTEw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"526483150736173","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"i have not checked the menu yet - but all i hear is CHICKEN CHICKEN - dont they have beef/lamb or even mutton\n\ni am not going to eat chicken","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:42:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"526485184069303","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"They hv beef shawarma.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:48:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"526485470735941","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"oh thank god","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:49:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"526485787402576","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"I'll wait for them to start dine-in to give Rowtisserie another shot.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:50:43+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"526486047402550","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"i will do a take away in about 2 weeks - if they dont start dine-in by then\n\nIrfan Ismail am taking you up on your offer","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:51:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail","type":"user","offset":77,"length":12}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI2NDg2MDQ3NDAyNTUw","before":"NTI2NDgzMTUwNzM2MTcz"}}},"restaurantName":"Rowtisserie"},{"id":"165861103465048_526381967412958","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Just ordered from Rowtisserie.
