I used to love having chapli kebobs at \"Bakhshu\" in Charsada, Hotel Jalil in Peshawar, and a couple of small places in Peshawar Saddar during my trips up north. Bakhshu's is the most famous and considered to be the best in KP. Another amazing chapli I had was in Mingora, Swat. It was a single piece and they would top it with \"nahli\". Great times! Anyways, I never had a good chapli in Karachi so if you let me know the location I would be most thankful.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T18:07:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"569119729805848","from":{"name":"Farhan Sultan","id":"100000271785679"},"message":"Too bad urbanite doesn't deliver log inn in gulshan :( :(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T18:08:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"569120863139068","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"This is the real stuff, BBQ tonight doesn't compare Ghausia Rashid Salam....Nasim Ahmad located in Tauheed Commercial Area....from Evolution go straight ahead and after passing Hot Spot lane you'll find the Chapli Shop on your left.  log Inn however is located on 32nd street Tauheed, one street before Hot Spot.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T18:12:01+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"569121919805629","from":{"name":"Hamza Khan Niazi","id":"517752460"},"message":"M Zarnab Intezar","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T18:15:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"524118544","name":"M Zarnab Intezar","type":"user","offset":0,"length":16}]},{"id":"569124996471988","from":{"name":"Ali Samran","id":"1535678705"},"message":"Log in lounge, Location","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T18:26:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"569126623138492","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Scroll up the comments I've just given the location","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T18:31:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"569129453138209","from":{"name":"Sara Kazmi","id":"100001822097920"},"message":"yeh to awesome hogaya :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T18:38:15+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTY5MTI5NDUzMTM4MjA5","before":"NTY5MDkyMDg5ODA4NjEy"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_569091579808663/comments?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTY5MTI5NDUzMTM4MjA5"}},"picture":"http://photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t1/996861_10151986501147785_426800576_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10151986501147785&set\u003dgm.569091579808663&type\u003d1&relevant_count\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif","restaurantName":"Saddar"},{"id":"165861103465048_568744683176686","from":{"name":"Asma Asghar","id":"709896077"},"message":"You all do know that Nandos wala chocolate cake Del Frio, Atrium Saddar aur Dolmen Mall Tariq Road mein Chocolate Heaven cake k naam se baichta hai, right?

Prepared and served hygienically in disposable containers/plates.  Though I am not a Zinger type burger fan, however, people rave about Cool Inn's Zinger clone.  The masala dossa is also pretty decent and the Spicy Chicken Boti Bun has a unique flavour (be cautioned its really really spicy).  They also make a  great faluda and the cold-stone ice cream (which they call as Katakat Ice Cream) is very good for the price.  Love their dark chocolate flavour and have it  \"Katakated\" with Soft Mints with a topping of chocolate sauce.  They serve the Katakat Ice Cream in a waffle cup which is crispy and delicious.  A whole variety of ice cream flavours is available to suit all tastes. Cool Inn is a must visit place for all Chaat lovers.  Its great value for money.
