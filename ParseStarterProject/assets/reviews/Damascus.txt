My dad is on a wheelchair but hates being wheeled or helped up stairs or whatever. He cannot stand or move from chair to chair and HATES it when people have to help him around/pick up his chair etc.\nWheelchair friendly doesn't mean having an elevator, or providing a wheelchair (we carry one in the car), wheelchair friendly means the person should go around freely, independently, like we do, Alhumdulillah.\n\n3) Dolmen Mall is NOT wheelchair compatible. My dad drives. Once in the parking lot, there are no elevators. What ridiculous planning is this? The escalators are not built for someone on a wheelchair.\n\n4) Port Grand is also not wheelchair friendly. It has these ridiculous separations/gaps and weird stones in the middle of the plain ground. THAT isn't wheel chair compatible.\n\n5) All the ramps available at a thousand restaurants aren't really useful. There's supposed to be a proper angle where the person on the wheelchair doesn't fly off if left unattended. \n\n6) Why don't people think of these things when investing in huge projects like Dolmen Mall?

Yes the waiters were very helpful In that they scooted over the tables so that my mum could slide into one of the booths. However, there should be higher seating in the waiting area in addition to a ramp for wheelchair access (not sure if the extension has this facility). This suggestion is not limited to just ginsoy, but is a request to all restauranteurs who are reading this. However, I found it relevant to mention ginsoy in particular due to the above claim they posted :) in summary, very helpful servers but not so helpful architecture.

I asked for Faisal who normally serves us and serves us well but was informed he is busy and can't serve you, \"us kay paas time nahee heay\" the other server said, shocking. After thirty minutes my order was taken verbally and took another half in hour for my order to be completed as it was served in bits and pieces, Tea first then food later one dish came after ten-fifteen minutes after the whole order was completed. Their was a supervisor in white shalwar kameez but he seemed oblivious to the situation. We were served by three different servers and the last one seemed deaf and mute because he never responded to my request, the precious one admitted they were short of staff when I complained. Finally a bill was scribbled and shown to me on the back of a brown envelope but I asked for a proper bill that took 20 more minutes, the whole process of ordering, serving and billing should not take an hour here it took double of that time because no one bothered to come and ask us if we needed anything. In conclusion as a old and regular customer of Damascus I would like to ask the management of damascus, who I am aware is active on this group, HOW do u expect it is physically possible for 3-4 servers to serve more than a 100 ppl?? They cover both gents and family section, you desperately need to hire more staff and train them better. I have had great Arabic food, Khava, green etc from Damascus and the service was excellent a few years ago, but now sadly service standards have fallen immensely, to catch the attention of a server its takes 30 min, to get your order it takes as much time and their is soo much confusion the servers are running around helter/skelter but not able to take your order, finally you bill take 20-25, good god, damascus was a sheer joy in the yester years but today it was a sheer torture, after today I can never go again, I rather go to the place opposite which cares and respects its paying customers and provides good service not such a painful experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-26T21:46:14+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-30T07:47:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100004229319190","name":"Sidra Saboor"},{"id":"654805071","name":"Rifa Di"},{"id":"501970131","name":"Waris Shaikh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAxOTcwMTMx","before":"MTAwMDA0MjI5MzE5MTkw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"640190982698722","from":{"name":"Najia Ahmed","id":"819424477"},"message":"I am a daily visitor at Damascus .

It is not about cost of employing more waiters or recoveries, only a matter of finding honest workers who won't embarrass a restaurant in worse ways than delayed orders (other food businesses will agree & can somewhat imagine the possibilities/their capabilities).

The only one who regularly came around was the sheesha wala to replace the coal.

It was downright the most awful service I have ever experienced. We were ordering alot of different shoarma but the waiter was persistent on just remembering the order instead of noting it down. But when he was unable to accurately repeat the order he finally decides to write it down. Now before he does that he disappears to take the bill from another table right between taking our order. We kept waiting for 10 mins before calling on the manager who then himself took the order.\n\nThen came the food. We asked what shoarma is what and that same waiter says they are all marked. Then I merely asked what a particular shortcut means and he says in an annoyed tone \"bhai jo hai wohi hai\". We called on the manager again and told him about the behavior of the waiter. He didnt apologize or anything and himself seemed like a very unprofessional individual. \n\nNow comes the most hilarious part. We asked for the bill the manager and waiter come  and start arguing with each other. The manager asks if he noted down the items and the waiter says no. They start having a furious conversation right in front of us lmao. Now the manager starts calculating the bill with a mobile calculator and a torch. He is unable to calculate, we are already getting very late and just paid what we estimated to be the bill. Thats just pure comedy if you ask me.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-02T20:11:38+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-03T16:23:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"668642026","name":"Talha Shahid"},{"id":"515773588","name":"Waleed Khan"},{"id":"636734568","name":"Aly Abbas"},{"id":"1669415344","name":"Emil Farooq"},{"id":"567615046","name":"Ayesha Ansar-Saad"},{"id":"522977702","name":"Sheikh Hasan Rasul"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"1781512632","name":"Vishal Preetam"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM4MjM2MTI1Ng\u003d\u003d","before":"NTI0NDc2NzM1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"627708483946972","from":{"name":"Fareed Shaikh","id":"100001444848696"},"message":"hahhahaa whata scene was tht ryte after one and other !!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-02T20:25:48+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"627763157274838","from":{"name":"Junaid Mansoor Khan","id":"660885104"},"message":"I loved that place...but no more Damascus for me!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-03T00:01:16+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"627842517266902","from":{"name":"Sadaf Saad","id":"100003863463567"},"message":"weird...\nbut i luv Damascus..!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-03T04:18:33+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"627862610598226","from":{"name":"Tasneem Rasheed","id":"744696139"},"message":"What did he need the torch for?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-03T05:20:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"627871437264010","from":{"name":"Faruq Khan","id":"746545306"},"message":"They have reached the level of their incompetence.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-03T06:07:07+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"627872810597206","from":{"name":"Aly Abbas","id":"636734568"},"message":"That was one annoying yet amusing experience !

Giving in to the glutton in us, we obviously over ordered but miraculously, wiped most of it clean off the plate. Service was swift, with no mix-ups in the order AND most importantly an abundant supply of icecream soda!! The Pita sandwich with it's crispy pita and melt in your mouth cheese, is highly recommended if you like your cheese, but if you're up for the more subtle flavors of a slightly toasted shawarma with a brush of garlic sauce and hint of chilli, i suggest you try the basic chicken shawarma, it is yum! The piece de resistance for me, however, has always been the shawarma platter. I don't like to share it, and rarely am i able to finish it, but no trip to Damsacus is justified if it is not ordered.

I had been craving chicken all day hence decided to order Rowtisserie chicken, reason being I don't like Damascus's overly salted chicken and was not in the mood for Nandos. Also I had only ordered from Rowtisserie one time when they had opened and the chicken came in 1.5 hours and was dry despite that I thought I'd give them another shot.\n\nI ordered the Rower's Meal II which included half a rotisserie chicken, Row sauce, Garlic sauce, Tabouleh, pickles, Pita bread, 2 sides of my choice and two drinks. I chose mash & gravy and hummus plus an additional heavy garlic sauce.\n\nThe order taker had told me 40 to 45 minutes for delivery so I expected at least an hour but to my surprise the food was delivered in 30 ! My grumbling tummy couldn't be more thankful.\n\nThe chicken was small but succulent, moist and not overly seasoned, just the right amount of spices gave it that wonderful flavour.  The mash & gravy was very creamy and delicious but I think the gravy could use beef stock in it. My favourite part was dipping the chicken in the Row sauce and then the garlic sauce both extremely flavourful....I'm salivating just by typing this ! The Tabouleh was fresh and a perfect accompaniment to the meal. The Hummus was the only thing I didn't like, it was too pungent and not smooth in flavour, also I would have liked an olive garnishing on top. The pita was fresh, I gobbled it up with the extra garlic sauce I had ordered. I was left feeling happy and satiated.\n\nKeeping in mind three things, taste, quality and service, I give them 8.5 /10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-19T16:10:10+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-20T05:35:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"647150297","name":"Mehreen Faisal"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NjQ3MTUwMjk3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"543415832376238","from":{"name":"Kashif Malim","id":"766095724"},"message":"Do you have a link to their page or website?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:15:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543429935708161","from":{"name":"Sana Sultan","id":"1519922458"},"message":"https://www.facebook.com/Rowtisserie?fref\u003dts","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:22:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543430325708122","from":{"name":"Kashif Malim","id":"766095724"},"message":"Thanks Sana :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:24:01+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1519922458","name":"Sana","type":"user","offset":7,"length":4}]},{"id":"543435195707635","from":{"name":"Mohsin Makki","id":"667511058"},"message":"sana for how much?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:42:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543445595706595","from":{"name":"Sana Sultan","id":"1519922458"},"message":"1345/-","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T17:20:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543455882372233","from":{"name":"Mohsin Makki","id":"667511058"},"message":"not bad :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T17:53:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543752059009282","from":{"name":"Hassan Farook","id":"621215659"},"message":"as you have mentioned that you did skip 2 of your meals I am sure it would have tasted better","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-20T05:35:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNzUyMDU5MDA5Mjgy","before":"NTQzNDE1ODMyMzc2MjM4"}}},"restaurantName":"Damascus"},{"id":"165861103465048_513373002047188","from":{"name":"Tariq Ghouri","id":"729880224"},"message":"I most probably gonna visit Karachi in this month, so want to know the new arrivals in town i already know about Street 14 Pizza and Fat burger please let me know other then that..\n\nP.S. i am coming after 1 and half year.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-04T11:05:57+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-06T09:06:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1454993708","name":"Tehniyat K.

Their lamb shawarma- better then any other shawarma I've tried, comes highly recommended.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-27T04:24:13+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-27T20:33:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000349262919","name":"Fiza Khuhro"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100002330340236","name":"Adeel Zafar Soomro"},{"id":"714115614","name":"Nefer Sehgal"},{"id":"517798722","name":"Omar Khan"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"517558557","name":"Huma Imran"},{"id":"679913965","name":"Hina Dhanani"},{"id":"500951481","name":"Rasti Ahmed"},{"id":"517361095","name":"Muhmmad Mehdi Siddiq"},{"id":"223600909","name":"Ahsan Shah"},{"id":"585785400","name":"Asad Aly Dhanani"},{"id":"522705412","name":"Marvi Shah"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ2NjY0NTM4","before":"MTAwMDAwMzQ5MjYyOTE5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"417489711635518","from":{"name":"Fatima Javed","id":"513648490"},"message":"LOVEEE the shawarmas from damascus and their garlic sauce is THE BEST!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-27T12:10:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417506304967192","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"good to know that some people will still eat there - i stopped after getting a burger that was made from all the left over meat in a butcher shop. it was utterly disgusting\n\nnever bothered to complain but have never gone back - \n\nprefer Arabian Nights for the outdoor-arabic-sheesha- experience","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-27T13:14:32+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417512904966532","from":{"name":"Hareem Sumbul","id":"501415716"},"message":"Oooh Arabian Nights is the one.

I would not have bothered replying if it was coming from one of many known self-appointed food connoisseurs and saviors of taste buds around the city; found mostly on Facebook food forums at all times of the day, their frustrations justified by the amount of time they spend ranting about the food they eat. And no, I won't be naming them. I am replying because it is coming from an educated person like you who I believe belongs to a respectable part of society and must have a genuine grievance to repeat such a complain everywhere possible. Whatever it may be, please accept my personal apology. With that said, I assure you, our 'beef' is purchased from Makro, which does not sell scrap or left overs no matter how nicely you ask, the beef is then minced at our restaurant, the trimmings and fat are cooked, with left over pita, bread, chicken and rice, and fed to my dogs, I have four; very loving, all of them.  Anyway, so we make an honest living by selling only the best available ingredients on the market, the sauces, marinades, and spices are all prepared at home in presence of at least one family member. While there is a margin of error in every food outlet, the climate not being very friendly and dependable staff being a constant nuisance, I can understand if the food you ordered arrived under- or overcooked, or if the spices were too little or too much, or something similar. But to accuse us of selling low quality food on purpose is unacceptable, not only because I'm saying so being a representative of Damascus, but also because it is the same food I eat at home, five days out of seven. I invite you to Damascus, make it a surprise if you like, we can both order a burger each to see what left over scrap I'm selling, & I promise not to cheat.

And then the alleged patrons of Damascus were suggesting that I should not have made my bad experience public on forums like SWOT and KFD as it shows that I have some of a personal vendetta against Damascus. One even suggested that I am perhaps getting paid by someone to bad mouth Damascus. Damascus' establishment merely suggested that I may be suffering from some sort of a allergy and they could not find anything in their records regarding my order and that they will get back to me. They merely let loose their hounds on me and never actually got back to me and did not offer an apology for my horrifying experience and the illness I have been suffering due to their food. I finally ended up going to the doctor today and he informed me that I am suffering from a throat infection. I specifically asked him if is possible that I may have contracted it from bad and/or rotten chicken. He said yes, it is very much possible. I am hereby completely writing off Damascus and will be never visiting it again.
