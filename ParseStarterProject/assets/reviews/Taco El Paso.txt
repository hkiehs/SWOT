The melted cheese on top was so inviting...its like my meal was begging me to dig in...take a soulful bite... and i couldn't keep it down. I didnt want it to finish...but then i saw the packet of cheesy nachos and the dip...so i finished my chalupa in small ...very tiny bites...trying to make it last longer. Hopped on to Nachos n the cheese dip.... Yummylicious!....and such good value for money...unlike the nachos u get at cineplex n forum...over priced n hardly there...forgetting the name of that stall. Another good thing was that the delivery was super fast!\n\nThen i called my brother n told him to try it on his way home from work...
