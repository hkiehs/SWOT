Its just amazing how Mr Big with Egg n Cheese is perfect every time . It feels like they have time frozen the entire process for the last 20 years . Succulent , Flavoursome , Juicy Satisfaction all wrapped up in One little Piece of Heaven. I'd rate it 12/10 , 2 extra points for that smile on my face every time I take the first bite.\n\n2- Al Asif Square : Though a bit risky for some fellows but to be honest the place was packed . We had food at MADINA RESTAURANT which is located inside Al Asif Square and to some people's surprise there were few families around there as well ( well to do families at that ) enjoying food , the atmosphere was friendly we were greeted as warmly as always . We had the famous Dumba Boti , Afghani Pulao , Namkeen Gosht and Karahi.  Now i don't want to waste time in describing the brilliance of food . \nThat is the best Authentic Afghani food out there, Period , 11/10 . One extra point for the Afghan brethren for their every gracious hospitality. \n\n3- Tayyabi Restaurant : Located in Hussainabad. It one of the few unsung heroes of Karachi. We ordered Prawn Masala , KataKat , Chicken Chargha Fry, Malai Boti and Tikkas . Food was served a bit late as they prepare all the dishes fresh and from the scratch. \nPrawn Masala is one of the best in town as the prawns just melt in your mouth and mix with that zesty masala . THE DAMN ! \n\nKatakat and Chicken Chargha fry are good too . All in all yet another place you wont come out unsatisfied or cheated, EVER . 8/10 . -2 for the stolen side mirror of my friend's car from the parking :P\n\n4-  The Burger Shack: I have Shake Shack every week so it did not impressed me much. But i'd like to commend the owner for doing the best damn possible thing by cloning a famous international franchise's menu and making it possible to offer taste in it as well. I was not disappointed to say the least. 7/10\n\n5- Cafeela : Simply put , Zahoor bhai you rock . Okra Jalfarezi , Malai Boti , Nathiya Gali Qeema , Shahi Tukray , Chicken Yakhni Pulao are all yum. One of the best value for money in town. \n\nI am a safe eater and a Desi at heart as I get to eat really yummy mum cooked food and these are few of the places I go to eat or get food delivered when I want to eat out. Flying out tonight . Will Miss Karachi as I always do .

I was really excited and oh well, i only WAS excited. Went with 2 friends, the place was pretty crowded and we were seated right away at the 1st floor (ambiance: 6/10).Turn off#1. I expected some complimentary bread basket etc but nothing. Found an exciting menu and that further ignited my appetite. Order 3 main courses and 2 drinks. Turn off #2. the waiter insisted to order their special beverages though we kindly refused about 4 times, eventually a shut up call was given. The food arrived within 30mins.\nTurn off#3. The chicken waffles were all about vegetables! Bland sauce, dry chicken, ordinary tarragons have more taste than this (5/10)\nTurn off#4. Burrito bowl, it looked like an absolute delight and all 3 of us attacked but Alas! it was a 'Chana Chaat Pulao' under the lettuce (it was hollow from the bottom). Its was beyond awful! Truly inedible, all the food was neither warm or cold, that was weird!\nTurn off#5. Mushroom Mac & Cheese, another bland dish, the cheese was all stiff from the top, stiff and kinda burnt pepperoni tiny bits, so the serving sizes were really disappointing.\nTurn off#6. The bill amounted to about 3k, since the experience was awful, with dissatisfied tummies,  it was pricey for me to pay 1k per head.\n\nNo offense but it was not my kind of a place. I'd still like to congratulate team pantry for putting in an effort, maybe I had a bad day since so many customers wouldn't have been there if it was that bad.
