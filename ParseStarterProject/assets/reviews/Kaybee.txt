Missed them all :-( Did go to Espresso and PITS (after hearing some girls in the line that there is something there) but i got done at 8:30 so it had ended. Treated myself to Manhattan Pizzeria and once again I was bowled away by a fantastic pizza...the Buffalo Chicken one. Would also recommend the Famous 2 deal at Red Apple the one with chicken cheese roll and chicken cheese burger. MUST try. Juicy moist yummy burger and that roll was just heaven on earth...every bite had cheese in it. And for 250 bucks it was too good to be true. Lastly, the Kaybees icecream is still great....and will take you on the nostalgic ride as the taste (along with the packaging, the perfect taste of ice cream with no after taste) is amazingly the same as it was years ago.

(I did not get the teaser or the invite in time and was sent an e-invite.) Not being a blogger myself, this is my first experience on an event such as this and my personal stance on the event is as follows:\n\nIn my mind I always equate Magnum to the 7 deadly sins, opulence and decadence. Yesterday at the presentation, it felt that their branding had changed focus to a more regal and royal theme but still having the underlined feel of opulence and decadence.  They wanted to portray that if you eat a Magnum, you would feel like being a King or Queen. Their main ingredient that would help them achieve that was ?Belgian Chocolate?.  How they are going to educate the masses regarding the qualities of the Belgian chocolate was not discussed and as you can see from the youtube clip (it is the same one from their own presentation) there is no mention of Belgian chocolate!  Another point is when I tasted the Magnum, the chocolate did not feel any different from other Magnums that I have tasted previously.\n \nTheir target market was 18-35 years old and people who fell into a more affluential  background. Their claim was that the Magnum was going to be the most expensive ice cream in Pakistan per single serving and that they would also be opening a Magnum Caf?. The magnum Caf? would also have a ?Make your own? Magnum dipping station. Although a fun idea, a dipping station is in my opinion is something  which is more catered towards children rather than adults and as I witnessed it was quite a messy job too! The dippings that they had were sprinkles, nuts and fruits, chocolate etc. Personally I find it very hard to see how any person could stick pieces of fruit on to the Magnum and I for one think fruit is a bad idea.\n\nOn the whole, will the Magnum entice the Pakistan public.... probably Yes! But will it be a profitable venture and achieve their goals and profit margins, that...... time will tell :-)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-03T08:25:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-13T01:35:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"795545463","name":"Riffat Alam"},{"id":"1091434889","name":"Haris Khan"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"1473431885","name":"Syed Aamir Bukhari"},{"id":"100000093496883","name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzMzcxOTYzMA\u003d\u003d","before":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"391463167571506","from":{"name":"Sarah J.K","id":"708025491"},"message":"lol cute ad...  they shoulda re-enacted something like this","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-03T10:33:02+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391477424236747","from":{"name":"Aruna Sujanani","id":"691887360"},"message":"They kinda did.

(I did not get the teaser or the invite in time and was sent an e-invite.) Not being a blogger myself, this is my first experience on an event such as this and my personal stance on the event is as follows:\n\nIn my mind I always equate Magnum to the 7 deadly sins, opulence and decadence. Yesterday at the presentation, it felt that their branding had changed focus to a more regal and royal theme but still having the underlined feel of opulence and decadence.  They wanted to portray that if you eat a Magnum, you would feel like being a King or Queen. Their main ingredient that would help them achieve that was ?Belgian Chocolate?.  How they are going to educate the masses regarding the qualities of the Belgian chocolate was not discussed and as you can see from the youtube clip (it is the same one from their own presentation) there is no mention of Belgian chocolate!  Another point is when I tasted the Magnum, the chocolate did not feel any different from other Magnums that I have tasted previously.\n \nTheir target market was 18-35 years old and people who fell into a more affluential  background. Their claim was that the Magnum was going to be the most expensive ice cream in Pakistan per single serving and that they would also be opening a Magnum Caf?. The magnum Caf? would also have a ?Make your own? Magnum dipping station. Although a fun idea, a dipping station is in my opinion is something  which is more catered towards children rather than adults and as I witnessed it was quite a messy job too! The dippings that they had were sprinkles, nuts and fruits, chocolate etc. Personally I find it very hard to see how any person could stick pieces of fruit on to the Magnum and I for one think fruit is a bad idea.\n\nOn the whole, will the Magnum entice the Pakistan public.... probably Yes! But will it be a profitable venture and achieve their goals and profit margins, that...... time will tell :-)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-03T08:25:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-13T01:35:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"795545463","name":"Riffat Alam"},{"id":"1091434889","name":"Haris Khan"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"1473431885","name":"Syed Aamir Bukhari"},{"id":"100000093496883","name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzMzcxOTYzMA\u003d\u003d","before":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"391463167571506","from":{"name":"Sarah J.K","id":"708025491"},"message":"lol cute ad...  they shoulda re-enacted something like this","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-03T10:33:02+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391477424236747","from":{"name":"Aruna Sujanani","id":"691887360"},"message":"They kinda did.

Rolls, Seafood, Ice Cream, Fast Food, BBQ - every restaurant is a jack of all trades. The customer is left confused, and the message as to what's \"good\" is usually distorted.  I have yet to order Golden Dragon or BOTS (not picking on either of you, but just pointing out my indecisiveness) because I have no idea what their best foot forward is. \n\nMy two cents for the day: \nRestaurants should offer less items and focus more on \"quality\" products. At the end of the day- the cost of maintenance, margin for disappointment, and overall efficiency are improved drastically.  If you can't do that, at least have a \"Chef's Recommendation\".

Decided on ordering the food from Arab Connection. Placed the order for Belly Dancer and Beefita / Chickita. On a brighter the service was excellent and the food arrived on the time they had committed. Another plus point would that the food is very very reasonably priced. \n\nThe Belly Dancer which is a replacement of sort of shawarmas was a disappointment. I thought it would have the authentic taste of Middle East as claimed on their facebook page, it was nowhere to be found. It was nothing like the shawarmas that are served in Saudi Arabia. SWOTTIES who have been for Umrah / Hajj would probably know what I am talking about as it has a very specific taste which I have yet to sample in Pakistan. \n\nThe Beefita / Chickita was at best, average. The taste was bland though it did have a decent serving. The only good thing about the meal was their dipping sauces aka the three wishes. The fries that came along were sort of a replica of the fries found at the likes of Kaybees or Red Apple. Basically they change colours in a few hours if you do not consume them. \n\nThough the place has been getting good reviews my experience was a little disappointing. I do not think I'd be ordering from them any time soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-16T15:44:32+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-17T07:05:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100000578236531","name":"Naheed Asim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNTc4MjM2NTMx","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"278913335493157","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"I ordered from there last week.
