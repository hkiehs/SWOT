The oldest and most famous was United Bakery,Periera bakery(famous for its coconut macroons) the Fresco bakery (President's in laws) Flurries and Blue Ribbon Bakery. Today we have several new players in the run starting with the run in the mill day to day bakeries examples are Mahmood sweets, Sony sweets and bakers,Ideal bakers top notch or high end we have Hob Nob, Pie in the Sky, Bravo, Neenis, Red Riding Hood, Torte Pasticceria,Lals Patisserie, La Farine,Espresso Gloria Jeans, then their is Cakery which was originally a home based bakery which progressed and today has its own outlet and a whole army of home based bakers, enterprising young and mature ladies who made their mark in the field of baking. Now the crux of this discussion is how much in your opinion should a cake cost?? How much are consumers willing to pay for a premium cake? Current per pound rates range from btwn Rs. 500-650-750- to 1000. Cakes have to be ordered in advance and cash advance has to be paid, a few years ago a friend running a bakery stated it cost 50% less but now the cost of the main ingredients milk, eggs, butter, icing, packaging and all other related costs have increased in a big way, but so has competition, as this page has several well know home based bakers and they will testify to the fact that due to cut throat competition they have to slash their profits while they work over time and hire extra labor to meet their clients orders on time. So now we should be able to do justice and decide as to what should a reasonable 5Ib cake cost? 500 per Ib or 750Ib? One new entrant on Zamzama shocked quite a few, they quoted 3000 ++ for a 4Ib cake, wow, that's like secret recipe which charged astronomical prices but crashed and burned in no time when they quoted these bombastic prices, so are we going to see more CAKE WARS in the the coming days with more new players emerging? Home based bakers dominating the scene or commercial entities, let's get some interactive and truthful comments.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-26T20:44:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-28T15:16:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"505055634","name":"Umme Ifrah Arif"},{"id":"1316130943","name":"Madiha Gillani"},{"id":"100003756103781","name":"Asif Jamil Ansari"},{"id":"1291009466","name":"Shahzar Pervaiz"},{"id":"515063254","name":"Kashish Ahmed"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"690822119","name":"Saniya Abdul Qadir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjkwODIyMTE5","before":"NTA1MDU1NjM0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"624856717565482","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"3000 for a 4lbs is not shocking.

I was utterly heartbroken to receive what I did - pasta with no white sauce, instead it was doused in oil. I would have still eaten it without the white sauce but it was impossible to consume with all that oil. My mother's wrap was ridiculously small, it was embarrassing because I'd blindly promoted everything - What could be wrong in the eyes of a fan, right? To top it off, they had put GST charges on\nthe bill. This is where my knowledge might lack a bit, but is that a common practice? Shouldn't they inform the customer when he's ordering? I complained about this to them when I received the bill and they said they would check and get back to me and I never got a call.
