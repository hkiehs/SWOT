She referred me to the floor manager of hyperstar. He tried his best to compensate me by offering 3 packets of maltesers. I requested him to open one of the packets in front of me so that I can check in front of him. Although, it looked better this time but still tasted like phenyl ki goliyaan. I left all three packets with him as he was advised by the management to offer maltesers packets only.","type":"status","created_time":"2014-01-11T18:51:42+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-12T08:19:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"510324323","name":"Taha Baig"},{"id":"100006531481514","name":"Shahzeb Atiq"},{"id":"732358125","name":"Komal Riz"},{"id":"1527883319","name":"Syed Muzammil Hashmi"},{"id":"623317230","name":"Arsalan Pervez"},{"id":"100002231996060","name":"Arham Malik"},{"id":"596211857","name":"Kiran S.
