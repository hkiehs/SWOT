Ordered a large pepperoni pizza and tried their new pan pizza (it's the size of a regular pizza) as well which was so good and not oily at all. For the pan pizza, we ordered the chicken golden delight flavour which had a combination of sweet corn, pineapples and chicken chunks, sooo good!! It is pricy as the bill came to around 2400 for a large pizza, pan pizza and cinna stix (4 pieces). But, the quality definitely justifies the cost. Definitely 10/10 for me.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-28T17:03:09+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-28T19:51:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"508776548","name":"Meher Saigol"},{"id":"805195531","name":"Amna Shah"},{"id":"100002759539286","name":"Sehar Mansoor"},{"id":"100001025670320","name":"Faizan Khan"},{"id":"1497320748","name":"Fauzia Farhan Hashmat"},{"id":"100006438076492","name":"Muhammad Farhan Duja"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1006587514","name":"Hira Saeed"},{"id":"502471479","name":"Madiha Zaheer"},{"id":"796000540","name":"Nisa Abdul Basit Khan"},{"id":"100000579313166","name":"Xobi Shah"},{"id":"520941960","name":"Fahad Hasan"},{"id":"1227546533","name":"Muzammil Shaikh"},{"id":"100001217752738","name":"MehRose Khan"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"548759195","name":"Afshan Khan"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

It need not be a fine dining place..\n\nOver the last 2+ years all I have seen in Karachi are different trends.. One person dares challenge Pizza Hut with a new very different offering and it becomes a hit among us 'the foodies'.. Next few weeks we see the numerous pizza places open up.. some are good some are OK but after a few weeks they all taste the same.. Then came the thin crust era (No offence to anyone I totally love Domino's Thin Crust pizza)  and everyone from Domino's and bakeries and cafe selling the thin crust..\n\nWhile everyone was enjoying the 20 inches pizza, Hardees came to town.. There again began this trend of selling burgers.. And its still ongoing..Everyday there is a new place advertising themselves..\n\nIs there any place in Karachi that offers something other than burgers and pizza and pasta which tastes good too... I don't mind having sea food or steaks (No Arizona or Roasters pls) but something that would just end this monotony in the food choices we have (or rather I have) in this city..\n\nI know some of you would say there is BOTS ( Love the food there), Ghaffar, Log Inn Lounge(Chapli Kebabs are awesome) and so on.. But really need some innovation something new and that can actually get someone hooked on to the place.. \n\nA few years ago there was this little cafe at Karsaz called Alao.. It used to have a great sandwich and very very good cold coffee.. It was a very quiet place yet I have not been able to find the same taste since it closed down..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-13T19:55:12+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-14T07:32:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002623239897","name":"Ezzy Irfan Izhar"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE2NTgyNjY2","before":"MTAwMDAyNjIzMjM5ODk3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"649509475100206","from":{"name":"Vishal Preetam","id":"1781512632"},"message":"burns road (Y)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-13T20:35:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"649513738433113","from":{"name":"Ammar Habib Khan","id":"685505866"},"message":"Rowtisserie.

It arrived piping hot in less than 15 minutes and MY GOD IT AMAZING. I'd ordered a beef extravaganza and every bite was like a bag of flavours. Mushrooms, pepperoni, olives and with such a thin crust and heaps of topping! plus the aroma was exquisite! :) Although one issue was that the cheese was a bit thick and wouldn't cling on to the slice when lifted from the box.

Food arrived, I received it myself, tasted awesome... Life was good. \nUntil the next afternoon. A rider arrives at my house and rings the bell. Answered by the maid. He tells her he is here to receive 'payment for food'. No further explanation. I was alone at home with my nephew, trying to put him down for his nap. Maid came to relay message and I told her I haven't ordered any food thinking there must be a genuine mistake. \nShe returns again saying the rider is insisting he talk to you and says please go see him at the gate. I was genuinely stuck with a cranky unwell nephew and didn't know what to do. \nDuring this process she hands over a dominos receipt of the previous days offer and obviously I'm FURTHER confused. \nI called dominos from my cell and in the mean time also ask to speak to this guys manager on his cell.  Manager's name was Faisal ( of Dominos Shujaat Branch). \nI explained to him what is going on and he said the rider who delivered the food to me yesterday had conveyed to him that I had requested to pay a day later!!\nNext obvious question from my side was 'do you have a policy of handing over free pizza after an assurance of being paid a day later?' And 'even if you do, could you not have called me there and then to confirm if your rider is telling the truth??'\nAt this , the manager retracted and apologized and I thought that was that. \nIt wasn't :-/\nRemember I was on call with the call centre on the other line? Well they looked into it and returned to me and said this Faisal guy had told them he had spoken to me himself and I had requested a latter day payment from him!!!\nI'm flabbergasted! \nFirst time ordering from Dominis.
