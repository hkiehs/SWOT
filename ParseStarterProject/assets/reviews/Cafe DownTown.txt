Never expect this from them. The waiter who was taking the order did not note our order and when we asked he was saying when he repeated the order we did not say any words. Well when we placed the order, means we are ordering and we did not say such word like cancelling the order. Spicy chicken wings was not like before! Had ice latte and small pieces of plastics were inside it, thank God i did not swallow them. Guess they are tired of making money!!!!!! Will NEVER visit them anymore!! Total waste of Rs 3150.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-15T23:10:02+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-16T10:06:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"755946312","name":"Ali Muhammed"},{"id":"550210650","name":"Maryam Majid Khan"},{"id":"626070061","name":"Salman Aly"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI2MDcwMDYx","before":"NzU1OTQ2MzEy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"557962567588231","from":{"name":"MAleeha A","id":"510432837"},"message":"It was disappointing 6 months back too..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-16T03:15:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"557969260920895","from":{"name":"Sadia Bilwani","id":"1415702282"},"message":"I always prefer going to Expresso or Gloria jeans at DMC","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-16T03:48:17+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"558045204246634","from":{"name":"Kamran Lasi","id":"617556139"},"message":"Aisyah Basheer why dont you try Cafe DownTown for delicious wings.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-16T10:06:59+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1045161983","name":"Aisyah Basheer","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14},{"id":"370831742948207","name":"Cafe DownTown","type":"page","offset":32,"length":13}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTU4MDQ1MjA0MjQ2NjM0","before":"NTU3OTYyNTY3NTg4MjMx"}}},"restaurantName":"Cafe DownTown"},{"id":"165861103465048_548576265193528","from":{"name":"Saifullah Mazhar","id":"517287393"},"message":"Sehar commerical is becoming another food street.
