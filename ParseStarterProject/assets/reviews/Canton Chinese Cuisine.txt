Had heard a lot about it so wanted to give it a try. First off, the ambiance was above expectation. Very neat, spacious and up-scale. Secondly, service was fantastic. They seated us quickly, they served us quickly and all the orders were correct and served hot. Waiters were very courteous, accommodating and attentive. They gave good suggestions and offered alternatives to suit our dining needs. I noticed that the manager also visited every table personally to ensure that everyone's dining experience was perfect. Thirdly, the food was excellent. We ordered a hot and sour soup, chilli lemon soup and dynamite prawn for starters. For the main course we ordered the Mongolian beef and chicken in black bean sauce. The staff was also nice enough to throw in a free garlic shrimp dish. The flavours were distinct, rich and delicious and the portions were just right. And surprisingly, this all came to less than Rs. 3000. Great food. Great service. Great environment. Great value for money. Canton, keep it up.
