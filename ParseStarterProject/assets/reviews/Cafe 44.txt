Complementary bread with garlic, and cucumber n some other veg with cheese mayo dip served. Both were good n I would rate them 8/10. We ordered cesar salad, the chicken quantity was very less for the hefty price. 6/10 Crepe champs elysees was good but overall not very filling quantity, 9/10. \n\nNow comes the steak. Ordered djonnaise steak, I was told it will be local tenderloin but I guess it was fillet mignon since the width was about 1.5 inch but the size was really small making it a total of 200 something grams. I ordered medium well but it looked pretty much medium, I requested them for it to be cooked more since and they changed it without any hesitation. 9/10. BUT it still does not beat the steak I ate in dxb, not even close and not that big as well.\n\nDidn't order the choc lava cake which was another reason to go there cuz I saw the dish being served on another table and it looked too tiny with vanilla icecream. \nOverall a good experience but too expensive for the quantity (2800 for 3 dishes of which 2 are starters). 10% service charge was applied but since it wasn't written anywhere I asked the manager to deduct it which he did, saving me 200+ rupees. I think it's a matter of principle and they should write it before charging.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-06T17:55:04+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"581431248574696","from":{"name":"Hamna Furqan","id":"667165223"},"message":"told u about the quantity :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-06T18:45:38+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"581647621886392","from":{"name":"Nasim Ahmad","id":"1343979604"},"message":"Thanks for the detailed review, Basit.

Was just curious if the management had been told about the problems and whether they had responded. Aman Virji is on SWOT so I am sure he will take notice. The issue is that if people don't point it out to the restaurant at that time, there is no chance for them to have a meal that they can actually enjoy ... and if the restaurant management is not on SWOT, they will never know or get the chance to fix the issues being highlighted. For me, comments on SWOT are greatly informative for food lovers like us ... however, it is also good if the message gets directly to the restaurant management at the time the customer is there so specific information can be given about the problems. And then, one can know if anything is being done in the short/long term to rectify the highlighted issues. I know everyone wants good options with respect to restaurants and if we provide useful, timely feedback ... maybe some of these problems can be addressed effectively.

However, I have been to Forty4 several times in small and large groups and at various times of the week / lunch / dinner. One of the most consistently noticeable comments from my friends has been to acknowledge the service in addition to the food quality, selection and value. That said, I am sure that there have been issues as Aman Virji has acknowledged. For the record, I would not hesitate to take groups of friends or professional colleagues to Forty4! One restaurant that remains unmentioned is Pompeii which should be in the running as they do meet all the same standards that Forty4 has for our dining experiences. Have not been to Thyme or The Patio so I cannot comment, although others have said good things about both places ... especially The Patio. Aylanto has disappointed us multiple times with respect to food and at our last visit, we actually left without eating due to issues with the attitude of the staff. For that reason, we have not been to Aylanto for many months now and therefore things could be very different by now so it is hard for me to offer anything more than our prior experiences while acknowledging the passage of time. Okra is not a place we have visited very often but many of our friends go there and I have never heard anything but glowing reports about the food with the only cautionary factors being the small size of the restaurant and sometimes the availability of reservations. Cafe Flo has its diehard fans or people like me who feel that it is nice enough but not among our first choices. Hope your dinner goes well, wherever you decide to go!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-24T15:57:36+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"797300590","name":"Aman Virji","type":"user","offset":398,"length":10}]},{"id":"492455000805655","from":{"name":"Saad Ahmed","id":"602358073"},"message":"Okra.

I was really delighted to have such a great food. Appetizers were among the best in town. We ordered for appetizers, 44 trio, prawn gambas, smoked tomato soup, carpaccio, seafood gratin, and caesar's salad, much to my utter surprise, it was amazingly prepared and presented to perfection. I cant really comment on each individual appetizer, but in simple words.. they seem to be michelin star quality. For main course, ordered a variety of dishes, the best one among all was Chocolate reduction Steak, chardonnay steak, and sea bass. Service was to its best. I do not have a sweet tooth so didnt taste any of the deserts, but i am sure those were equally good. My first experience a few month back was really bad. But if they keep this much improved service and food quality, i would love to eat there every week. Sonia Chundrigar , i must appreciate the improvement and hats off to you guyz.

The Basil Chili chicken was  very good too. What i liked about the place was that each entree/appetizer that we ordered had a very distinct, flavorful and fresh taste to it.

It came in a small rectangular plate without a side. So we ordered steamed rice separately which came in a bowl that held at most 5 tablespoons of cooked rice, which was disappointing again. The stir fry along with the steamed rice tasted fine but then again it was nothing to write home about. Everyone I went with had a problem with the portion size and some of the food tasted bland as well so we eventually left feeling unfulfilled, disgruntled and hungry. I guess what made the overall experience even worse was realizing we've all had similar cuisine in Karachi which is more economical and also better tasting than the one served at Cafe 44.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-16T15:39:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe","type":"user","offset":0,"length":6}]},{"id":"278929285491562","from":{"name":"Sajida Ali","id":"1442271682"},"message":"I think most karachiites who try out 44 will swot it like sarah has done for a lot of reasons including the value for money factor and the bland taste factor.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-16T16:57:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"278942952156862","from":{"name":"Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi","id":"684515056"},"message":"i think its a really cheap way of making an extra buck for restaurants when they dont serve food with the essential sides.esp if these restaurants are expensive.  i mean, chicken stir fly has to have rice, the same way steak comes with veggies and a baked potato.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-16T17:25:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"278977968820027","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Sajida Ali:- The question of swotting after so much negatives is a tough one, the primarily objective of this SWOT page, and correct me if I am wrong is to improve standards and point out where things need to be and can be improved, if an employee is not doing his job properly that doesn't mean he is a bad person, its just means that he needs counseling and he needs to realignment his priorities. Bland food, value for money, a little extra, small things to complete a dish and personalized service are VERY IMPORTANT to make a new joint take off.My advice to restaurant owners is don't look at reaping back what you have sown the first day the restaurant opens, give it some time, twelve to eighteen months, give it your best shot, establish yourself in the market, address customer complaints, make changes and woo customers, who may be disgruntled and not completely satisfied. We have seen so many success stories, which had quite some negative reviews early, like CBG, like Olivetto, Okra, Cafe 9, The Deli, and many others, their owners and management took pains and worked hard to redefine their image and achieve success and carve a niche for themselves. The owners and operators of Cafe 44 and Xanders need to realize that Rome was certainly not conquered in one day and customer is the King, the only way that they can achieve success is continuous evolution and improvement. We can SWOT it anytime but the owners and management should commits to fine tuning and bring themselves up to the required level. I hope this topic stands concluded from critique point of view.
