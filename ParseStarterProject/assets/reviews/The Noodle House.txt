Although this time I thought the service had some flaws  but the food was good. We ordered Spicy Aromatic Chicken Dumplings, Laksa, Black pepper beef, Crispy Chicken with Plum sauce and Wok fried Noodles as a side. Laksa at Noodle House has always been out of this world, absolutely flavorsome! Black pepper beef was tender and delicious while crispy chicken with plum sauce had crispiness and sweetness which went well together. A bit more effort couldve been put into the noodles but they were okay. Dumplings were good too but although theyre cooked well they have this pinkish appearance which is unappealing. Portions were good for us. \nThe service lacked where they served us main course when we werent even done with our starters, the main course had to wait on our table and went cold as we got over with the starters. Also as the server took away our plates, he took my cutlery aswell. These are small mistakes but make an impact on the customer satisfaction.\nOverall a good experience, the drinks Mojito and Lychee Pine had a good visual but tasted ordinary. \n\nI feel people in Pakistan find it difficult to acquire authentic tastes as we are naturally inclined towards everything cooked well done, spicy and oily. But continental dishes taste good in their own authentic flavors. By this statement I do not mean to offend anyone I, myself have very desi taste buds but not every continental food can be maneuvered to suit our tastebuds.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-15T18:33:35+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-15T19:13:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001226932306","name":"Muntaha Khan"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"1405185438","name":"Tayyaba Hasan"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

And addictive. The laksa was even worse than last time and I will not be ordering that again. The Thai chicken was well cooked succulent and flavorful. I liked the finely shredded kafir lime leaves for the aroma. The Thai green curry was full of different colourful  vegetables and thu the one at FUCHSIA is better, this one does get some points for the effort. The vegetables thu could have been less wilted. The wok fried noodles served with the chicken were sent back as they were just noodles dipped in cold stale oil. The egg fried rice was however perfectly flavored and cooked.\n\nIt's a pity that such a lovely place with a lovely view (especially in this weather) was kinda empty but we also went there around 2:45.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-10T16:22:31+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-11T10:35:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"736493359","name":"Adnan Ahmad"},{"id":"100000613630813","name":"Zoja Noaman"},{"id":"849085572","name":"Hasham Ibrahim Khan"},{"id":"591022035","name":"Sameer Mirza"},{"id":"531056010","name":"Samreen Feroz"},{"id":"100002628885416","name":"Muhammad Salman"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"100003971348832","name":"Ingloriously Vain Faced"},{"id":"100000999733392","name":"Hadi Khan"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"539145384","name":"Saher Shaikh"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg1NTA1ODY2","before":"NjI1OTY4OTUz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"631587193559101","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"This ASIAN CHOPPED SALAD has become a fav of mine since last week.

THAT teriyaki was what i returned for to The Noodle House Pakistan but by that time, we were all done with the food, and once the rhythm breaks, its just not fun anymore. so we just had one piece and were done. i was so sad. because the second teriyaki he cooked for us was just amazing, there was just no space for us to eat more. i asked him, what went wrong with the first one, said the new one had some tenderiser in it. well, thats a go chef. Please always use tenderiser. it works well. \n\ncomplimentary mango pudding was served in order to make up the teriyaki. i would rate it a (7/10) and a 10/10 for being considerate. \n\nfor all the good things, i still dont like being charged for whats not edible for me. and i did not enjoying paying for that teriyaki. \n\nan over all 6/10 for me on the second visit. i think the 3rd visit will take a while, and cant risk it with anyone else. will have to go alone.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-08-29T18:52:34+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-29T18:52:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1257283317","name":"Aymun Zafar"},{"id":"100001089240373","name":"Abdul Basit Sivany"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTc1Mjc2NzUy","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"picture":"http://photos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/t1/1185297_10151972482393125_1418762510_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10151972482393125&set\u003dpcb.611417202242767&type\u003d1&relevant_count\u003d9","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif","restaurantName":"The Noodle House"},{"id":"165861103465048_610978432286644","from":{"name":"Asma Uzair Warsi","id":"508353910"},"message":"Hmm I think we need a mufti here.

Big mistake. The place wasn't even packed to the hilt like others, yet the service was so darn abysmal. We got the \"Ramadan Deal for 2\" - which had an iftar platter, a choice main and a side and 2 drinks. So far so good. Its the food and service that came with an extra side of \"pathetic\" that totally ruined our evening. The iftar platter had 2 dates, 2 prawn wontons, 2 chicken dumplings and 4\\5 flattened, leather-like pieces of chicken atop a weird sauce (I didn't have the stomach to try it, but my guess is honey mustard, maybe?!). Anyway - wontons and dumplings were not bad. Chicken - made actual chamra look more appetizing. For the main, we ordered a sweet and sour chicken, which was average and you could count a total of 10 boneless chunks of chicken. Ordered lemon cooler, which came after 30 mins. The main come even after an hour of order and repeated requests to the waiter and manager. In the end, cancelled the remaining order which included the roasted chicken curry and fried icecream and got the hell out of that stupid place. Never again!!

Had a small hiccup yesterday, but the efforts they tried to make in order to make it up to me deserve a big round of applause, especially the resturant manager Nabeel Saab, The Noodle House will definitely be on my visits in the near future especially during lunch. The way you guys handled my very small complaint has really humbled me, and this should serve as a lesson in customer service for resturant entrepreneurs, especially those among the young lot who are yet to fully value the importance of customer. What a difference, some would go to every length possible to make sure their customers even the most difficult to please one's are not unhappy, while there are some who on the smallest of complaints regarding customer service tell you to take a Hike. (Hint Hint).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-11T06:01:53+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-11T06:01:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"697141034","name":"Farah Faraz"},{"id":"511547758","name":"Zohaib R"},{"id":"660435505","name":"Sajjad Bin Ali"},{"id":"745715077","name":"Shazeb Siddiki"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ1NzE1MDc3","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"restaurantName":"The Noodle House"},{"id":"165861103465048_500519489999206","from":{"name":"Haseeb Kasbati","id":"734427032"},"message":"can any one suggest me which one is better yuan tung or jade garden in chinese?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-04T14:58:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-07T20:26:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000299126508","name":"Ahsan Javed"},{"id":"100003672338905","name":"Umbreen Mahmood"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAzNjcyMzM4OTA1","before":"MTAwMDAwMjk5MTI2NTA4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"500525619998593","from":{"name":"Sabrina Shahid","id":"589565258"},"message":"none","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-04T15:12:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"500525856665236","from":{"name":"Haseeb Kasbati","id":"734427032"},"message":"so where to go for a good chinese food?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-04T15:13:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"500536439997511","from":{"name":"Amad Ul Hasan Siddiqui","id":"538934895"},"message":"both are really good depending on one's palate. yuan tung is particularly a favourite among Swotties. however I would recommend Jade garden for their extensive menu.
