bun kebobs a lot but admit to not really having them past years due to stomach problem risks. One of the best used to be at PIDC near the famous pan walla. When I was going to Govt Commerce in the 80's this was the place we'd go to after school. They don't use a traditional bun but a bohri bread type bread and very nice spicy chutney and no onions or veggies. Incredible bun kebob that can only described as 10/10. I don't know if he's still there and if so whether same standard but worth trying and now that I mentioned it will probably go there again after many a year. Tipu Burger a joke, their chutney very \"peeka\" and no zing to the taste. Like eating plain bread. A friend once took me to a famous guy in Nazimabad called \"Bapu Burger\". I have to say that was amazing. Clean kiosk and incredible rush, maybe 30-40 cars around him. Although he has the shami kebobs his best bun kebob has a thin hunter beef-type patty which is incredible. Someone just opened a bun kebob place clean and hygienic looking next to Chase dept store in Clifton.
