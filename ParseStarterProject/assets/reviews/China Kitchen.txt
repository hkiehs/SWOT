He said that he was handed over food by China Kitchen at 2pm. Even if it was true, it does not take 50-55 mins from China Kitchen to Shahrah e Faisal near FTC.

Lil difficult to find the place as it is without any signage. Ordered Chilli Garlic Prawns, Grilled Calamari, Avacado Prawns, Smoked Salmon, Seafood Chowder, Prawn Masala from Kerala, Crab Grattin, Grilled Red Snapper with Pepperonata, Grilled Seabass and Blue Cheese Steak. Also had fresh Watermelon :) Food was very very nice and presentation was extremely good with few exceptions.....Grilled Calamari and Avacado Prawns....didn't like both. Servers were very well trained. Only other problems i noted were that since the restaurant is established in Swiss Cottages, the kitchen does not have a separate access like China Kitchen hence everything moving in/out has to pass through the service area where guests are housed and although the food quality and taste was beyond imagination...there were not many guests. I mean we were the only people there. This is probably one reason that they are closing down for lunch wef 10th June and now they will be only open for lunch on weekends. I would give food 9/10, service 8/10 and ambience 7/10. My favorites were Crab Grattin, Grilled Seabass and Grilled Red Snapper! Will sure recommend seafood lovers and I will definnitelyyyyy go again!!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-09T13:32:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-09T14:23:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"1505127873","name":"Moazzam Ahmed Amin"},{"id":"556372046","name":"Ammara Shariq"},{"id":"509568517","name":"Beenish Ehsan"},{"id":"647940246","name":"Maheen Khan Omair"},{"id":"666536302","name":"Momina Ahmad"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE2OTk1NDIx","before":"MTQ2MDIyMzIzOA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"569032789814542","from":{"name":"Haider Zaidi","id":"687255482"},"message":"Haroon Leghari","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T14:23:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100000059823691","name":"Haroon Leghari","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]},{"id":"569032853147869","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Ahmad","id":"536832784"},"message":"Good objective review.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T14:23:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTY5MDMyODUzMTQ3ODY5","before":"NTY5MDMyNzg5ODE0NTQy"}}},"restaurantName":"China Kitchen"},{"id":"165861103465048_562529583798196","from":{"name":"Jawad Majeed","id":"504317020"},"message":"Ordered Ginsoy via the FoodPanda app on my phone.

Came back at about 11:30 starving. Had a normal unda toast naashta and 4 bites of the refrigerated leftover burger from BURGER INC. have to say noot baad..seriously next time I am ordering two so I have a cold for naashta. \n\nThen the hard hard work at the clinic.....desperately needed good coffee and had a meeting so went off too LAL's \n\nMadiha Sultan Tai.....really good mug of large vanilla latte. Good beans. Tried 4 different macaroons.....pistachio, chocolate, lemon, strawberry....the experience was very nice. The macaroons themselves were perfect found the filling in each a little insipid, met MST and she said that it was no issue next time that will be corrected. First time into LAL's it's so pretty and I love some of their pastries I have already had those and didn't want to add to the calories......also had a little something waiting at home.....\n\nCame home to find that an order of brownies were waiting from Taha Zoeb....and OH MY GOD.....Perfect ones..... Haider Zaidi you need to try these to understand what I was saying and why I suggested a few tweaks. Will bring some over tomorrow Haroon Leghari.\n\nHad promised that I will Eat for a Cause.... So called GinSoy for a reservation for 2..... They were booked so called up China Kitchen instead and at 8:30 met Mahvash Siddiqi Khan there. Since just two offs and we are both adventurous we thought hmmmm lets have the duck. So with that one beef ribs ( yes I can't go there and NOT eat those) and one crispy beef.  The food as always was amazing. Loved the duck thu not the hoisin so took Ghazala Mijnhart advise and added some of the hot savoury sauces provided on the table. Had a lovely evening gossiping with MSK....don't get a chance for that too often there are always many people around. Ghazala tu is a treasure cove full of great idea and suggestions.\n\nAll in all a great day with many diverse aromas and flavours for THE SWOT to indulge in - in one day. \n\nCiao down amigos have a good and peaceful weekend.....for tomorrow is Nihari brunch at Log Inn lounge (Snaps Har, Abid Aziz Merchant - you guys game?)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-09T21:57:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-10T16:51:58+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"731377379","name":"Shahzad Pirwani"},{"id":"681799779","name":"Ratan Salem"},{"id":"723085405","name":"Taha Zoeb"},{"id":"641324643","name":"Nadia Moqeet"},{"id":"1579977743","name":"Amena Zoeb"},{"id":"505055634","name":"Umme Ifrah Arif"},{"id":"523286481","name":"Adnan J.

However, I have been to Forty4 several times in small and large groups and at various times of the week / lunch / dinner. One of the most consistently noticeable comments from my friends has been to acknowledge the service in addition to the food quality, selection and value. That said, I am sure that there have been issues as Aman Virji has acknowledged. For the record, I would not hesitate to take groups of friends or professional colleagues to Forty4! One restaurant that remains unmentioned is Pompeii which should be in the running as they do meet all the same standards that Forty4 has for our dining experiences. Have not been to Thyme or The Patio so I cannot comment, although others have said good things about both places ... especially The Patio. Aylanto has disappointed us multiple times with respect to food and at our last visit, we actually left without eating due to issues with the attitude of the staff. For that reason, we have not been to Aylanto for many months now and therefore things could be very different by now so it is hard for me to offer anything more than our prior experiences while acknowledging the passage of time. Okra is not a place we have visited very often but many of our friends go there and I have never heard anything but glowing reports about the food with the only cautionary factors being the small size of the restaurant and sometimes the availability of reservations. Cafe Flo has its diehard fans or people like me who feel that it is nice enough but not among our first choices. Hope your dinner goes well, wherever you decide to go!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-24T15:57:36+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"797300590","name":"Aman Virji","type":"user","offset":398,"length":10}]},{"id":"492455000805655","from":{"name":"Saad Ahmed","id":"602358073"},"message":"Okra.

Never has this been the case with food at Fuji. Each one of us have lodged our complaints with them, left comments on their comment cards, spoke to the staff about it, just if someone here represents the management, please ask them to give us our old Fuji back. \nTalkign of sushi, in the sushi world we now have Oishi Sushi that closed down from its Port Grand venue and opened up right next to China Kitchen. Second visit today. Again, didn't comment earlier as it could've been beginner's luck but today...WOW. I can easily name it my new favourite sushi place but we can always do with more than one.

Any desert makers out there that wish to supply please get in touch with me on 03002020555 to discuss and arrange a meeting to go through what you have on offer.  All the deserts will not necessarily come from one source.  For example on the desi side we are going to put CAFEELA'S SHAHI TUKRA which is one of the best Shahi Tukra's I have had for a long long time...we intend to credit the desert supplier with the credit on the menu...so for example if we have Cafeela's Shahi Tukra ...then that is what it will be called on the menu.   We will not take credit for it....Why we wont make our own deserts? ..that is a question that has a simple answer...we will be a restaurant famous for its food and service....deserts are not our forte ...so we will let the professionals in that field provide our customers with the best that is available in town.  In time when we are ready to launch our own array of deserts and are convinced it is top class...we will do so...It is a principle we will adhere to stongly...let us provide the best deserts in town under one roof.  I believe we will be one of a few Restaurants that will have a desert trolly rolled out to the table for the customers to choose from....

Considering the minimal seating arrangement, not surprised that the place was packed, but its nice to see a crowd everytime I pass by Shehbaz. Chicken wings were nice, tempura was alright too. Crispy beef lacked flavor, and the chicken manchurian was okay. I'm not saying I didn't like the food; it was good, but quite the Paki version of chinese food.

Many an accomplished baker has tried, and tried again to perfect this innocent looking British/ Scottish bread. Although I do not consider myself an accomplished baker from anywhere, I too thought I could 'make it at home for nothing', needless to say it was a sad sad day in the kitchen.  \n\nComing back to the ones I ordered today, the scones themselves were pretty close to the real thing; buttery, feather-light and crumbly. Although I felt they hadn't risen enough, (the picture on the fb page will tell you that), they look quite flat although the ones I ordered had a bit more height on them. Still, they tasted great and hit the spot.\n\nHad to settle for double cream instead of clotted cream and although I was initially disappointed when I heard that, it turned out to be an acceptable substitute. \n\nNow for the sad part, I come from a house hold where Jam is taken very seriously. Buying jam/ jelly from the market is a sin. The jam that accompanied the scones was not home made and would have ruined them, thankfully my kitchen is always well stocked with seasonal/ non seasonal jams all year round. Strawberry jam to the rescue. \n\nAll in all for those who are sick to death of the trillions of places offering cupcakes camouflaged with mountains of sickeningly sweet icing, the scones at Mad Hatters Tea Room are a savior. Pure and wholesome. A perfect example of less is more.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-10T15:18:34+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-11T10:14:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"585622689","name":"Naveed Ismail"},{"id":"504176735","name":"Ali Farookh Rizvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA0MTc2NzM1","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"395712810479875","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"That's it?

Im not much of a sea food person either but I tried the Crab Rangoon the wontons were scrumptious and melted in my mouth. Will definitely have them again. Also tried the chicken lettuce wraps, the iceberg was crisp and the chicken melange was succulent. I wasn't as adventurous as to try the prawn on toast but since it was devoured I'm sure it was pretty fantastic too.\nI also tried the duck for the very first time and to my surprise quite liked the meat.

As u might have read and observed, a few individuals r quite upset about their dining experience since feb/march. What our patrons actually experienced at that time was a 8 course meal when we first opened at rs1800 per head with 5 entrees at least. That on its own is great value. They were  never forced, alternate and cheaper set menus were always available. Subsequently, when the ala carte came through, we made sure to check our prices again due to customer complaints - but none of the dishes prices  were changed on an individual basis and we have manage to get an avg per head at rs1200. Duck is extra - its a premium imported meat in karachi. I acknowledge there was a one off bad experience when China kitchen was surprise swotted but that should not have individuals poking at the restaurant and it's potential customers on every positive post that comes through. Thats just sad and its like a kick in the stomach every time. I am glad that you have enjoyed your meal again and I hope that China Kitchen will continue to keep it's standards up to your mark.

Most people are having great experiences there now and happily reporting about it. I still haven't given CK another shot, perhaps because I sensed a lack of interest on the part of owners/ management in acknowledging that they goofed up that day and couldn't care less.. and this wasn't just through notes on SWOT.. This was a first-hand experience. Anyways, the point of this post is that you just need a few words and goodwill gestures to nullify a customer's bad experience.

As u might have read and observed, a few individuals r quite upset about their dining experience since feb/march. What our patrons actually experienced at that time was a 8 course meal when we first opened at rs1800 per head with 5 entrees at least. That on its own is great value. They were  never forced, alternate and cheaper set menus were always available. Subsequently, when the ala carte came through, we made sure to check our prices again due to customer complaints - but none of the dishes prices  were changed on an individual basis and we have manage to get an avg per head at rs1200. Duck is extra - its a premium imported meat in karachi. I acknowledge there was a one off bad experience when China kitchen was surprise swotted but that should not have individuals poking at the restaurant and it's potential customers on every positive post that comes through. Thats just sad and its like a kick in the stomach every time. I am glad that you have enjoyed your meal again and I hope that China Kitchen will continue to keep it's standards up to your mark. Standby for some new dishes to be introduced in June and enjoy the fantastic lunch specials :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-25T04:38:27+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"385742574810232","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"I stand by your vision.

I was a part of that group but I never wrote anything about my experience. Yet, I have been following most posts on it and I have seen a clear perception change. Most people are having great experiences there now and happily reporting about it. I still haven't given CK another shot, perhaps because I sensed a lack of interest on the part of owners/ management in acknowledging that they goofed up that day and couldn't care less.. and this wasn't just through notes on SWOT.. This was a first-hand experience. Anyways, the point of this post is that you just need a few words and goodwill gestures to nullify a customer's bad experience. That ugly episode and the ensuing ill-will could have been avoided if CK accepted then and there that they messed up rather than insinuating that some of us had a hidden agenda.

We happen to go to China kitchen some time back for which I had made a reservation in advance. When we go there, I was told that we could not be accommodated inside where we were initially booked for and the only option was to sit out side. It was not a matter of sitting outside but the way the hostess put it was, take it or leave it. There was someone already sitting on then table apparently waiting for their table inside. Our guests started to arrive so we decided to just take the table. The setup was actually thrown on the table, without actually being. The way they  took the order was if we had done a favor coming to the restaurant. The food was very average - Dynasty @ Avari is still the best and there is no comparison. Anyway the dinner ended and as I drove off, I realized the I realized the left hand mirror on the door had been ripped and stolen. I called the restaurant back when I reached home I was spoke to the hostess who said to send her the bill for the repairs.  After having the mirror repaired thru the insurance i took the bill for balance payments as insurance companies deduct for depreciation. At the restaurant the hostess simply refused to accommodate as she says it was on the slip when I had the car valet parked that it was on my own risk. Her attitude was again rude and arrogant. Something which I should I have expected as she showed it the day we went there for dinner. I just took the bill back and walked out. While I do understand that cars are parked at owners risk, there is still a duty of care the owners are supposed to provide. She did mention that they have tried to remove the druggies from around the neighborhood who could have possibly stolen, but it was not there fault. Since then I have decided not to go there. I thought of posting this earlier but decided against it. The new restaurants, and the look restaurants must remember the first thing about hospitality it's customer service.

Was advised on the phone to make it 8:30 to which I showed my inability so they very kindly acceded to my request to accommodate us at 9:00 for which I am extremely grateful to the management of CK.  reached at 8:50 pm to find the restaurant empty but soon other customers started to arrive and by the time we left at around 10:00 the place was still half empty (CK management, why was I asked to make my reservation 8:30 instead of 9:00 when the restaurant was not booked to full capacity?) the servers were very courteous and the food didn't take much time to arrive at the table - 10/10 for service. Starters - Hot & Sour Soup - was liked by all 4 of us but it was a bit too sour, would taste even better if the vinegar is put on hold, Wasabi Prawns - 4 decent sized prawns fried and coated in wasabi/creamy white sauce served luke warm and Crab Rangoon - creamy crab meat wontons served cold - 6/10 for starters.  Main courses, Mu Shu Chicken - DIY paper thin pancakes served separately with chicken qeema and a black sauce - very desi stuff, Kung Pao Chicken - chunks of boneless chicken in red sauce with veggies and cashew nuts which were liked by all, Beef Steak - chunks of beef with veggies in black sauce, again liked by all, egg fried rice and chicken chowmein (very salty with excessive use of soy sauce with hardly any chicken meat in it) - 7/10 for main courses.  Prices reduced since my earlier visit and quantities much improved, the above order would suffice 5 persons easily. Total damage approx 5K inclusive of soft drinks and 16% GST.  BTW, their bill shows the restaurants name as \"Chineese Kitchen\" with a double \"e\" in Chineese and not China Kitchen and GST# shows as xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx and NTN # as xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-15T18:40:58+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-17T17:03:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100000444703801","name":"Saeed Jamal Tariq"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"28121518","name":"Shajia Sarfraz Haroon"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjgxMjE1MTg\u003d","before":"NTAxNDE1NzE2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"379812732069883","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Now I can breathe.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-15T18:46:02+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"379820528735770","from":{"name":"Rehan Ateq","id":"100000063312493"},"message":"For me china kitchen was not great experience now I back to my only favorite Chinese restaurant dynasty","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-15T18:56:08+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"379825142068642","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"AAM: they allowed you back inside? ;-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-15T19:03:40+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"379827698735053","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Why do u think I was holding my breathe","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-15T19:08:06+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false},{"id":"379828465401643","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Nezihe Hussain now you can breathe - AAM has given a fairly nice review!!Hussain Tariq","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-15T19:09:12+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq","type":"user","offset":73,"length":13}]},{"id":"379846062066550","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"I knew he would have a better time.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-15T19:38:06+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"379869885397501","from":{"name":"Saeed Jamal Tariq","id":"100000444703801"},"message":"Very 'Coool' review.

Is it a cafe?? \n\n5. After making a complaint to one of the partners, he told me that he would send the concerned person to us so that we may speak directly......that person NEVER came.

The first impact of a new venue should b spot on....and...... It was so very off.\n\nNo official SWOT plan but it was just a group of us ladies who wanted to get out for a good meal and good company......but what u served us...sure left u SWOTTED!! \n\n1. At first sight....food quantity was minuscule....it was as if each grain of rice, chicken diced and beef sliced was counted. Roughly one beef slice and 3-4 TINY pieces of chicken for each person. I didn't touch the crab wontons and the fish due to allergies.  So at least the others got a piece extra to share (seriously one wonton was made into 3 pieces by Reshma Rajpar to share) \n\n2. Undercooked food....chicken and beef both on my plate and others was not cooked....slimly red n pink flesh just put me so off I couldnt eat anymore (not like there was much to eat). A few others also had the same issue with their meat. \n\n3. We were adviced by management to sit inside (we wanted to sit in the patio) that sitting outside would leave us with cold food.....so then when we stayed indoors why was cold food served to us???? Not a single dish was served warm forget about being hot. \n\n4. If this was a so called \" fine dining experience \" then why was there a blender Making a huge racket just 2 feet behind us?? Is it a cafe?? \n\n5. After making a complaint to one of the partners, he told me that he would send the concerned person to us so that we may speak directly......that person NEVER came. Guess they don't wanna hear the truth\n\n6. Bill took forever to come...we were sitting almost 30 mins after food waiting for the bill....what was there to calculate when it's a set menu per head and only 2 bottles of water was ordered? \n\nA very SAD affair for sure...\n\nOnly saviour was that food was not directly proportional to the GREAT company! \n\nWe ladies made the best of it with jokes n laughter and had an 'entertaining' experience with the replicas of the Terracotta Army.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-19T19:59:15+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-20T21:12:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"688040667","name":"Farahnaz Haider Shaikh"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"},{"id":"711344798","name":"Wajeeha Zaidi"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"718395717","name":"Bina Ali"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMDE0NDc1NjIw","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"299533236764500","from":{"name":"Shafia Agha","id":"650845003"},"message":"should have gone to Cinnabon ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-19T20:03:12+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"299533673431123","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"Shafia Agha.....Lols!!!

The first impact of a new venue should b spot on....and...... It was so very off.\n\nNo official SWOT plan but it was just a group of us ladies who wanted to get out for a good meal and good company......but what u served us...sure left u SWOTTED!! \n\n1. At first sight....food quantity was minuscule....it was as if each grain of rice, chicken diced and beef sliced was counted. Roughly one beef slice and 3-4 TINY pieces of chicken for each person. I didn't touch the crab wontons and the fish due to allergies.  So at least the others got a piece extra to share (seriously one wonton was made into 3 pieces by Reshma Rajpar to share) \n\n2. Undercooked food....chicken and beef both on my plate and others was not cooked....slimly red n pink flesh just put me so off I couldnt eat anymore (not like there was much to eat). A few others also had the same issue with their meat. \n\n3. We were adviced by management to sit inside (we wanted to sit in the patio) that sitting outside would leave us with cold food.....so then when we stayed indoors why was cold food served to us???? Not a single dish was served warm forget about being hot. \n\n4. If this was a so called \" fine dining experience \" then why was there a blender Making a huge racket just 2 feet behind us?? Is it a cafe?? \n\n5. After making a complaint to one of the partners, he told me that he would send the concerned person to us so that we may speak directly......that person NEVER came. Guess they don't wanna hear the truth\n\n6. Bill took forever to come...we were sitting almost 30 mins after food waiting for the bill....what was there to calculate when it's a set menu per head and only 2 bottles of water was ordered? \n\nA very SAD affair for sure...\n\nOnly saviour was that food was not directly proportional to the GREAT company! \n\nWe ladies made the best of it with jokes n laughter and had an 'entertaining' experience with the replicas of the Terracotta Army.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-19T19:59:15+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-20T21:12:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"688040667","name":"Farahnaz Haider Shaikh"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"},{"id":"711344798","name":"Wajeeha Zaidi"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"718395717","name":"Bina Ali"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMDE0NDc1NjIw","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"299533236764500","from":{"name":"Shafia Agha","id":"650845003"},"message":"should have gone to Cinnabon ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-19T20:03:12+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"299533673431123","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"Shafia Agha.....Lols!!!

With so many NAKHRAS by the restaurant management, we expected top quality food and service.  They messed up with our request for the menus we emailed to them and the dietary requirements were not even considered.  If they didn't want to check our email reply which was sent to them at least 12 hours before their deadline then why the hell did they have so many requirements???

As Mahvash has very rightly said above its cramped seating but that can always be overlooked if the food served is decent enough.  We booked a week in advance and then yesterday we were told that we have to choose out of one of the 3 set menus and dietary requirements and have to intimate the restaurant before noon for the dinner which we did.  With so many NAKHRAS by the restaurant management, we expected top quality food and service.  They messed up with our request for the menus we emailed to them and the dietary requirements were not even considered.  If they didn't want to check our email reply which was sent to them at least 12 hours before their deadline then why the hell did they have so many requirements??? The food served was undercooked, tasteless and cold.  The ice cream served was to put it in your own words like Lassi.

As Mahvash has very rightly said above its cramped seating but that can always be overlooked if the food served is decent enough.  We booked a week in advance and then yesterday we were told that we have to choose out of one of the 3 set menus and dietary requirements and have to intimate the restaurant before noon for the dinner which we did.  With so many NAKHRAS by the restaurant management, we expected top quality food and service.  They messed up with our request for the menus we emailed to them and the dietary requirements were not even considered.  If they didn't want to check our email reply which was sent to them at least 12 hours before their deadline then why the hell did they have so many requirements??? The food served was undercooked, tasteless and cold.  The ice cream served was to put it in your own words like Lassi.

I took the set menu (thank god for simplicity) Started with Hot and Sour soup, Wonderful smoky taste, adorned with Tofu, ginger and Shitake mushrooms. Brilliant, as good as any soup in a decent New York restaurant. Then came the wontons, crisp with a plum sauce.The most amazing dish was the fried squid, covered with sechuan pepper, tiny diced chillies was pure heaven. Moist, flavourful, balanced with shrimp. Awesome. Then the crispy beef in a noodle nest. Once again the tang of orange peel, the sweetness the crisp crunch. Then came the mind blowers. The black pepper beef, was moist tender chunks of beef, delicate, juicy and tender, like top sirloin. Spotted Ayaz of Okra  dining next to us. The tender chunks of chicken in a tangy sesame sauce.  The Sechuan fish was awesome. I do not praise restaurants much, usually I am underwhelmed. BUT.... China Kitchen has done something that few will appreciate, they have REDEFINED the ketchupy food we have come to expect from Chinese restaurants. The food, the service was Awesome.... I hereby award my RED HAT for the best upcoming ground breaking Chinese Restaraunt. The food was divine, except the fried rice.

However the quality of food and service detoriated so bad so soon..held a management dinner there mid Dec, the food tasted below average and the waiters stank. They somehow were adament on removing plates before we could finish our food and were bending over our heads to do so. We complained multiple times but no use. In starters, the calamari was stale and not crunchy as usual, the salads lacked seasoning and were dry, only wontons were the saviours. In main course, the spicy lemon fish was bland, the shrimps were overcooked, the glass noodles tasted really odd with only dominant red chilli flavour, spicy red chicken & sweet & sour chicken were only decent entrees. Creme brulee in dessert was a major disappointment for whoever ordered it. They lost good 10 potential and 4 existing customers that day! i hope they recover soon.. till next good review from anyone its off my list!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-10T12:57:55+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-11T07:29:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"677666360","name":"Fazal Gafur"},{"id":"728371533","name":"Ismaa Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzI4MzcxNTMz","before":"Njc3NjY2MzYw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"293659717351852","from":{"name":"Shafia Agha","id":"650845003"},"message":"bee, you should have gone to Pompei.. :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T13:13:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293674054017085","from":{"name":"Benish Omair","id":"512153949"},"message":"Yup sent the team to Pompei next day..but I had high hopes from forty4 :(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T13:46:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293682410682916","from":{"name":"Ismaa Khan","id":"728371533"},"message":"Going to wait for the green light from you, Benish before we head there.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T14:05:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293699430681214","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100001014475620"},"message":"yes the ambience is veryyy nice they need to work better on their food","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T14:46:53+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293879597329864","from":{"name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha","id":"584682243"},"message":"went there last night and the food was good! 7 of us and everyone loved what they got...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T20:25:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"294198240631333","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"There are still more bad reviews than good ones  and the stinky waiters clinched it for me.

Either way I am sticking to the known good ones. \n\nBenish - next time try Cafe Blue Ginger, The Deli or Olivetto  for your management meals you won't be disappointed in either the food or service.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-11T07:29:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mjk0MTk4MjQwNjMxMzMz","before":"MjkzNjU5NzE3MzUxODUy"}}},"restaurantName":"China Kitchen"}]}
