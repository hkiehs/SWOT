The service is fantastic and the best part is that the actual owners were there greeting the customers themselves. They made sure that everything went smoothly for everyone in the restaurant. And No...it was not a special day. They are there at all peak hours....which is cool....\n\nThe soup recommendations were the best part. I think it was called Alaskan soup. I forget the name. \n\nOverall it was one of the finest dinning experience I have had in a long long time. Hats off to the new team.

Aman Virji and team will ensure that you leave with a satisfied tummy and a smile on your face. Impeccable service, world class hospitality, scrumptious food, this place is fine dining at its best. \n\nThe Thai Red Curry, although not spicy, was delicious. The quantity of rice should be equal to the curry but no complaints. However, not a big bringal fan. Will ask them not to add that next time. Not that it changed the flavor or anything. It tasted just like the TRC at Deli and Fuschia so I would give it a 7.5/10. Baan Thai still bags 9/10 as it is spicier.\n\nFriends liked their Beef Tenderloin with Dark Chocolate Reduction, Saffron Chicken and Pan Seared Seabass as well as their orange, grapefruit and apple juice. The Seabass was a sure fire hit!

After being more than highly disappointed in the food at Baan Thai and Royal Elephant(at P.C), a friend & I decided to dine at Fuchsia for lunch today. My previous post on SWOT was about recommendations so as to make the dining experience worthwhile. A thanks goes out to all of you for taking out the time & putting in efforts (in the form of comments on that post) to provide recommendations & assist me in making valuable selections from the menu at the aforementioned restaurant.\n\nAt the entrance, we were given a warm welcome by the smiling staff who upon checking with our preference, lead us to our table on the ground floor, in the non-smoking area. Since it was a weekday, not too many diners had crowded the floor. Unlike many people out there, I like to eat at peace & do not prefer over crowded &/or noisy eateries. After finding ourselves comfortably seated at a corner table, our order for appetizers, main course & beverages was taken by a cooperative & friendly waiter. We ordered the Creamy Coconut Soup with straw mushroom & lime leaf. An assortment of add-on spices and sauces were served to spice it up according to our taste. For main course we ordered  Red Snapper with chilli tamarind oyster sauce & Red Curry Chicken with bamboo shoots and sweet basil. While we were enjoying the flavour packed soup, a group of 4 kittie party aunties arrived & were seated on the table for 8, next to our's. They hadn't even properly greeted eachother when the rat race of fashion & who-spent-how-much-on-which-nail-salon-this-week gossip began. Their gossip or the topic of discussion was none of my business ofcourse, had they not turned their get together into a fashion expenditure war when one of the wannabe girl-aunty started to boast 'n' brag soooo loudly that I had to request the staff to move us elsewhere & escape from that material-war in process before their remaining guests arrived. Yes I was expecting atleast a few ounces of speaking etiquettes & decent body language from them.\n In no time, we were shifted in the smoking area upstairs, since the stuck-up group had the entire restaurant involuntarily all ears to them. The staff didnot become annoyed with my request & infact, very happily served our meal at the new table. Our main course was served in a matter of only ten to fifteen minutes of placing the order.\n\nThe  red curry (with  rice) was divine, flavoursome, and wow! However, the fish failed to impress us. It was too stiff (not crisp), lacked freshness, was dry to the core & not actually something I would order next time or recommend to anyone. I didnot ask for a replacement or complain about it because I  tried it for the first time at this restaurant & felt maybe it was meant to look & taste like it did. When offered to fill out the comment card, I did provide a written honest feedback  about the fish not to be at par with my expectations/ liking. I felt that would suffice, along with complementing on the things I liked about Fuchsia.\n\nRestaurant  ambience was pleasant, staff were clad in smart,  clean uniforms, were very attentive & alert to the needs of diners & order timeliness was observed to be quite impressive!\n\nOverall a great experience! I look forward to visiting Fuchsia again to devour in the various other specialities of the 'loved' place.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-19T16:28:49+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-20T13:10:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzkyNDcwMTcw","before":"NjI1OTY4OTUz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"400766493307840","from":{"name":"Rabiya Syed","id":"1453901313"},"message":"You should have requested a replacement for the fish  immediately.Its normally very succulent,crisp on outside but really soft inside and its sauce is absolutely delicious!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-19T23:51:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400856599965496","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"Fuschia is one of my favouritist places ever!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T03:52:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400948083289681","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"@Rabiya Syed I thot of doing that first, then I thot shayad aisi hi hoti hogi, so didn't bother","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T09:36:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400948269956329","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"@Charmaine u were correct, the red curry was actually to die for!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T09:37:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401016543282835","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"I told you!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T13:10:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDAxMDE2NTQzMjgyODM1","before":"NDAwNzY2NDkzMzA3ODQw"}}},"restaurantName":"Baan Thai"},{"id":"165861103465048_393970250654131","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"Lunch today...suggestions?!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-07T06:13:19+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-07T11:13:25+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"393972100653946","from":{"name":"Ali Raza Pir","id":"515674780"},"message":"no soup for you!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-07T06:20:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393979530653203","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"Thanks.
