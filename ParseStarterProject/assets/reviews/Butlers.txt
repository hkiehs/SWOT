I couldn't really taste the cheese, probably because  they were too stingy with it.  The hash brown (since there was only one) was pretty decent, but hey I wanted an omelette, not hash brown.  Espresso, I guess still serves the best mushroom & cheese omelette out there, but couldn't go there because I wasn't accompanied by a female, and am probably a pervert in their sexist dictionary.\n\nA friend ordered Spaghetti Bolognese, it was probably the worst one I've ever had -- much better stuff can be cooked at home, at a fraction of cost.  The sauce was overpowering, and the thickness and flavor of the spaghetti rivaled Maggi Noodles.

I'm here on vacation from abroad so when friends suggested 'Sam's Place' (located above Butlers on Zamzama), i was more than a bit skeptical. I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to food & eateries, & expected to be taken to a dingy little place with an ogling staff & less than mediocre food. There are no pictures because I was hungry & didn't think of it! But the place is very pleasant, even the entrance on the ground floor. The staff was extremely courteous & attentive. After placing the order, we were each given a small canap? plate, & bread baskets with flavored butters; the bread seemed freshly baked. The menu was quite impressive. Since it was post iftar, we didn't order proper meals but decided to split a few things. The salad with caramelized walnuts & balsamic vinaigrette was exactly as it should be. An appetizer with cranberries & gorgonzola wrapped in puff pastry was also delicious. Unfortunately the other dishes were chicken which i find the most unexciting of meats, & so i didn't even bother tasting them. Dessert was a brownie something; again, well-made & tasty, not at all 'fast foodish'. The music could do with a tweak but besides that if Sam's Place maintains food & service standards, they are worth a visit.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-14T20:29:25+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-15T20:18:12+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"502436694","name":"Batool Habib Curmally"},{"id":"500616229","name":"Sama Aman"},{"id":"626070061","name":"Salman Aly"},{"id":"706770021","name":"Fariha Tungekar"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"},{"id":"668110949","name":"Danish Majeed"},{"id":"100002989785243","name":"Mareah M.

BarBQ2night: for its (ISO certified) quality, consistency, cleanliness, & of course their German precision food engineering: P     \n3. CBG: oh this requires an academic thesis, or @least a drawing room discussion, a 1liner is not enough.\n4. Patio: cutesy, warm ambiance, gr8 food and different menu4a change.

The Pakistani at Sheraton- great ambiance, attentive service, love the rose water scented pre-dining hand-rinsing, the post-dining paan and dessert trolley, and a wonderful way to impress family and friends visiting from Abroadzzz.\n12. Crescent Nimco in Bahadurabad- great samosas, chaats, jalebis, chai, kahva, and superb selection of nimco items to take home for when you are feeling like DIY-desi snacks.\n13. This is a tie between Tutti-Fruiti, for its unique self-serve experience and sugar fee varieties, and Berrylicious cuz they are simply sugary-sweet and opening up at Port Grand!\n14. Port Grand- clean and fun atmosphere, with smelly-free views of the harbor, nice walking and shopping, good security, and a decent variety of food for all budgets and tastes. Plus, this allows us to hoot and holler (yeah, i almost became a lawyer, like the loophole?) about Aylanto Bistro and Ghaffar Kabab Hoouse, even though the one in Delhi Mercantile is waaaaay better and more generous!\n15.

Butlers- for their 'super-sexxxxy-mocha'- yes, you can go there and ask for it, it's basically extra chocolate syrup..\n18. Olivetto- where else can you get the options for fine-dining or lounge, both with excellent menus?\n19. Koel cafe- for their 'fire and ice' drink, which much like the owner, is the quntissential embodiment of Eastern elegance and taste, met with a certain Western and Worldly sophistication. \n20. The dark brown, unsliced, artisan breads at Hyperstar's bakery. their almond croissants (buttery croissants with actual almond paste inside) too, which are available every now and again on sundays.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-12T08:08:35+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-12T15:46:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"689771441","name":"Riffat Fawad Bukhari"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAyODQxNzU4","before":"NTgyOTYwNTc1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"396668170384339","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Fawad.

Enough said!\n\nTutti fruti Froyo: I love the fact that they keep bringing in new flavors every week. So far, my favourites have been lychee and peach\nBreakfast at Xanders: Tried their soft scrambled eggs, Xanders Club Sandwich, berry daiquiri and strawberry smoothie?absolutely loved the sandwich! I just wish they had pizza in the mornings too. I can have their pizza at all times of the day!\n\nKolachi:  Had heard alot about their makhani handi?taste was alright but left me feeling too heavy?could not have more than a few bites. I really liked the nachos there! The service there deserves special mention. I would definitely go there again.\n\nA One Rolls: Though I used to love the rolls there as compared to eaton, hot and spicy and other roll places, the past couple of times when I went there, the rolls were soggy and extremely oily. \n\nCup a Soup Chicken Laksa at Aghas: I was very hungry (starving actually lol) when I had it and really liked the lemony coconut soup. Would have preferred if it was just a tiny bit more on the sour side as that is the way I?ve had it in Malaysia. A little more punch can make it really Wow! Btw I tried to make it my way at home the next day (just added a little extra imlee ka pani) and it was fabulous!\n\nButlers for lunch today:  Turkey Club Sandwich was good to taste?however, it was falling apart and not too easy to manage. I did not try the spicy chicken sandwich and Butlers Club Sandwich but my friends seemed satisfied with them. The chocolate decadence and hazelnut dessert (oops forgot the name but the dessert itself was pretty forgettable :S!) were fine. I guess I wasn?t in the mood for sweets. \n\nOh I also attended a dinner event at Marriot. Why oh why does the food at 5star hotels have to be so bland????Loved the potato gratin though..just the right amount of cheese and garlic butter..yum!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-09T19:02:29+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-10T09:54:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"753461179","name":"Rohia Zohaib"},{"id":"682241004","name":"Atif Malik"},{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid"},{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"589485566","name":"Murwah Tariq-Atif"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"757449744","name":"Syed Sabih Abbas Razvi"},{"id":"828190023","name":"Shaheen Nouman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODI4MTkwMDIz","before":"NTUyMDA2MTU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"395602850490871","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"\u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T09:54:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzk1NjAyODUwNDkwODcx","before":"Mzk1NjAyODUwNDkwODcx"}}},"restaurantName":"Butlers"},{"id":"165861103465048_393651564019333","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Experienced three firsts at three different places today. First, Tutti Frutti. Walked in with my bud, after making sure it wasn't too crowded. Enjoyed eying the toppings and immense variety of frozen yogurt options. I saw the mango flavor and made a bee-line for it. I like my fro yo straight up, so just took the mango and dug in. My friend turned his yogurt into a sundae, so I didn't touch that. The mango was nice, albeit clearly artificially flavored. After my friend tasted it, he compared it to peshawari ice cream. Happy, Taha? I added that it was without the creaminess which sticks to the roof of one's palate and coats the tongue. It was more on the tart side, and not really my thing. The rupee per gram and self-serve concept is pretty cool, though. A great addition to Karachi's fun places. Then, we walked over to Butlers, and got ourselves a Philly cheese sandwich which we shared. Honestly, it should've been named something else. There were no onions, jalapeno, capsicum, and the cheese was definitely not Irish. It was thick, congealed and more difficult to chew than the meat, which wasn't very flavorful itself, but there was so much going on in there, the meat kinda disappeared. I suppose there are people who would enjoy it, such as my friend but me, not so much. The coffee however, was lovely. Thick, creamy foam on top, and strong, delicious coffee underneath. I do believe that the best was saved for last. Moved on to the Upper Crust for more fro yo (How could I not?) and lucky me, mango and Belgian chocolate were there today :D Of course I had to have both. And I gotta tell ya, that mango was just....and I'm by no means being biased here, but mango was the bomb. The schnitzel (Taha again). The bomb diggity dawg. The shizz. Spot on. Rocking. And whatever other terms might come to mind when complimenting something out of this world. The Belgian chocolate was delicious as usual, but the mango frozen yogurt at Upper Crust was the star of today's show for sure.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-06T17:47:38+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-07T06:30:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"570766058","name":"Ayesha Saeed"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"643405172","name":"Sarah Ashraf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQzNDA1MTcy","before":"MTA2NjE3NjUxMA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"393664034018086","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"i think the girl likes mango FroYo","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T18:16:28+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393667197351103","from":{"name":"Nada Navid","id":"1621356970"},"message":"yep,that's what even i made out of this post :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T18:24:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393684984015991","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"I love mangoes.

Ended up at the Dolmen Mall wala Butlers. Wouldn't you know it, two flies greeted us before the servers could, and at least one of them remained to keep us company so we wouldn't get lonely. How nice. We ordered the Butlers club sandwich, my sister ordered the traditional chocolate shake, and I ordered the pina colada. Aside from the friendly flies, things were grand. Once the sandwich arrived and we each took a bite, my sister declared it 'unimpressive'. However, I enjoyed it since the bread and vegetables were fresh, and I could taste the delicate honey mustard and tender chicken. The fries were thin and crisp and we got a generous helping of ketchup. After polishing off the first piece, I went in for the second. Unfortunately, there was a wad of tissue paper wrapped around the lettuce in the middle of the sandwich and was hanging out the bottom. Now, I'm not a fussy customer. I loathe writing negative reviews, and I detest customers who treat an eating out experience like a free meal. However, I do believe that if I can do anything to help out an establishment from a customer's point of view, I do so. Once I discreetly showed our server the tissue wala sandwich, he whisked it off and returned 5 minutes later asking if we wanted another sandwich. I said, 'No, thank you' with a smile, and the rest of our eating experience moved along pleasantly enough since I got to eat all the fries. Yay! When the bill came along, my sister exclaimed over how we were charged fully for the club sandwich when one-fourth of it wasn't even consumed. I told her we were looked after well enough, and to leave things be. Although I have no complaints, I would suggest everyone look into your food before chowing down. After all, you don't want tissue flavored with honey mustard in your tummy :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-28T14:15:13+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-29T08:49:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"739670623","name":"Faryal Naqvi"},{"id":"570766058","name":"Ayesha Saeed"},{"id":"585622689","name":"Naveed Ismail"},{"id":"100000271785679","name":"Farhan Sultan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwMjcxNzg1Njc5","before":"NzM5NjcwNjIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"387813854603104","from":{"name":"Misbah Omar","id":"509911471"},"message":"agreed 100% with the above!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-28T15:59:25+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"387816681269488","from":{"name":"Marvi Jatoi","id":"1108385601"},"message":"I happened to stop by butlers at dolmen mall, to get some chocolates, there were flies on the chocolates.. i asked the waiter to throw them away, and he did.. but why were there flies in the 1st place?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-28T16:04:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"387824781268678","from":{"name":"Amna Jatoi","id":"100001692464184"},"message":"Dolmen Mall wala butlers sucks!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-28T16:20:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"387851167932706","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Muneeza and Marvi, it's a relief to know I'm not the only one who experienced the flies and extras in my food.

The creme brulee espresso only tasted of coffee, no hints of 'creme brulee' flavour whatsoever, which was disappointing.
