Thought might as well utilise them as otherwise I would never try the McDees's breakfast for the reason stated above plus the regular bad reviews written a number of times by various Swotties.  Got complimentary Egg Muffin, Sausage Muffin and Hot Cakes and while I thought I would never be going again at 6 am to get breakfast in Karachi I might as well should also try the Big Breakfast which was a chicken sausage, muffin, scrambled eggs, hash brown and a coffee. After trying all these I cannot understand why all the bad reviews.  Everything tasted great - muffin, sausage, hash brown, scrambled eggs all were delicious.  \"I'm lovin' it\" or maybe \"I'm losin' it\".......","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-30T02:12:52+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-02T18:49:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"},{"id":"500778016","name":"Hammad Munir"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"601165290","name":"Syeda Mahnaz"},{"id":"200305341","name":"Maheen Bajwa"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"648921043","name":"Fahad Dawach"},{"id":"574052713","name":"Harun Aziz"},{"id":"1377186173","name":"Owais Mahmood"},{"id":"786945014","name":"Samia Chundrigar"},{"id":"619270706","name":"???

Was wrong)\nAnyways moving to the menu which to my delight was pretty extensive. We ended up ordered a stuffed chicken omellette with peach lassi, a stuffted cheese one with starwberry lassti for one of the kids, mushroom and chicken creapes with pineapple juice, plus the puries with channay. The stuffed chicken omellete was a delight. Filled with chicken and was spiced to perfection. The lassies were jam packed with flavor the strawberry flavored ones were loved by the kids. And they loved the cheese omellette and creapes. Everything came steaming hot. And service time was great despite the crowd.

Enough said!\n\nTutti fruti Froyo: I love the fact that they keep bringing in new flavors every week. So far, my favourites have been lychee and peach\nBreakfast at Xanders: Tried their soft scrambled eggs, Xanders Club Sandwich, berry daiquiri and strawberry smoothie?absolutely loved the sandwich! I just wish they had pizza in the mornings too. I can have their pizza at all times of the day!\n\nKolachi:  Had heard alot about their makhani handi?taste was alright but left me feeling too heavy?could not have more than a few bites. I really liked the nachos there! The service there deserves special mention. I would definitely go there again.\n\nA One Rolls: Though I used to love the rolls there as compared to eaton, hot and spicy and other roll places, the past couple of times when I went there, the rolls were soggy and extremely oily. \n\nCup a Soup Chicken Laksa at Aghas: I was very hungry (starving actually lol) when I had it and really liked the lemony coconut soup. Would have preferred if it was just a tiny bit more on the sour side as that is the way I?ve had it in Malaysia. A little more punch can make it really Wow! Btw I tried to make it my way at home the next day (just added a little extra imlee ka pani) and it was fabulous!\n\nButlers for lunch today:  Turkey Club Sandwich was good to taste?however, it was falling apart and not too easy to manage. I did not try the spicy chicken sandwich and Butlers Club Sandwich but my friends seemed satisfied with them. The chocolate decadence and hazelnut dessert (oops forgot the name but the dessert itself was pretty forgettable :S!) were fine. I guess I wasn?t in the mood for sweets. \n\nOh I also attended a dinner event at Marriot.

Also, let me make it clear that I don't know any of the people involved nor have I been to Cafe 76. Personally, if I have a problem with the food being served to me at a restaurant, I would call over the manager or someone to let them know immediately and give them a chance to fix it... and would not wait for the comment card to be given. That way, if I was unsatisfied with the response, then I could say that there was no satisfactory management response after they were given an opportunity to fix things. Also, if I did own a restaurant, even if I did not appreciate the method or timing of the customer complaint, I would take notice since where there is smoke, there is fire. There may be an underlying agenda, but surely there has to be some issue ... small or not ... that exists and bears investigation. I think both sides could do things better and that SWOT is not about blame or mud slinging but it is for all of us to share experiences ... whether positive or negative ... for the benefit of everyone who reads this page.
