The wings were delicious and cooked to perfection - compared to Nandos wings that came burnt and uncooked. \nAll in all, loved the service by both Foodpanda and Domino's - definitely my new fav pizza place.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-09T12:43:52+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-09T18:02:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"573835420","name":"Shariq Zia"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"100001607688817","name":"Ayesha Ahmad"},{"id":"526088510","name":"Umair Ali"},{"id":"614947148","name":"Muhammad Adnan"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"789059761","name":"Asim Mashkoor"},{"id":"784582234","name":"Hareem Ubaid"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"1645233586","name":"Haneeah Adnan"},{"id":"100002505633547","name":"Umme Kulsoom Khalid Ahmed"},{"id":"553565407","name":"Ana Ahmed"},{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid"},{"id":"612561937","name":"Nida Zahra"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"100003660266586","name":"Mariyam Shahjahan"},{"id":"100005879858955","name":"Hamayun Nisar"},{"id":"100000500015381","name":"Anwer Ansari"},{"id":"564445611","name":"Shahbaz Ali Shueb"},{"id":"594039575","name":"M Babar Saeed"},{"id":"684252451","name":"Umam Jamal"},{"id":"739067064","name":"Rakhshanda Khan"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"716205426","name":"Hina Lakhany"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE2MjA1NDI2","before":"NTczODM1NDIw"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_664040110313809/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzE2MjA1NDI2"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"664049730312847","from":{"name":"Taha Tungekar","id":"515233878"},"message":"when did that happened ???","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-09T13:17:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664050010312819","from":{"name":"Hassan Khan","id":"535065551"},"message":"i also ordered dominos through food panda yesterday !! \nIt was amazing.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-09T13:18:41+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664052680312552","from":{"name":"Muhammed Umer Mulla","id":"595408686"},"message":"yaar you should have tried their butter glazed dough pizza....it is amazing","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-09T13:26:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664053273645826","from":{"name":"Taha Tungekar","id":"515233878"},"message":"sure Muhammed Umer will be waiting for that when you next order tht.... will definitely try tht :P ..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-09T13:28:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"595408686","name":"Muhammed Umer","type":"user","offset":5,"length":13}]},{"id":"664053863645767","from":{"name":"Madiha Salman","id":"813380327"},"message":"Now im craving for dominos tex mex deep pan..i just love their new deep pan pizza!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-09T13:29:55+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664056630312157","from":{"name":"Rabiyah Tungekar","id":"516995421"},"message":"Thank you, Madiha for recommending :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-09T13:37:51+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"813380327","name":"Madiha","type":"user","offset":11,"length":6}]},{"id":"664077886976698","from":{"name":"Rabiyah Tungekar","id":"516995421"},"message":"Taha, it happened today :P\nMuhammed Umer bhai, next time at your house, your anni treat ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-09T14:21:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"515233878","name":"Taha","type":"user","offset":0,"length":4},{"id":"595408686","name":"Muhammed Umer","type":"user","offset":27,"length":13}]},{"id":"664085906975896","from":{"name":"Basit Abdul","id":"649505174"},"message":"Domino's Pizza is not bad, the only problem I have with them is that their website is never updated.

While there was still 5 minutes for our turn, I went up to the manager and told him, please hold onto my reservation, I shall be back from the cabin outside. I was back instantly and it was 11:00, I was told by the manager, that sorry you have missed your turn and would now have to wait for another 15 minutes. (and have no policy of holding a reservation, which they did not mention earlier). I waited another 15 and was given a table. I asked for the order to be taken but it seemed as if the place was understaffed. After 10 minutes my seating was shifted upstairs (as I requested there was no cooling at the spot I had gotten). I literally had to ask 3 - 4 times, for my order to be taken. A waiter came to us and noted our orders at sharp 11:30 pm. We were told that the order would take atleast 30-35 minutes to be served. I was not okay with the further waiting though, but I observed a family seated next to me, were so pissed off and complaining that their food had not been served since over 45 minutes. I decided to walk out, I came downstairs, asked the manager to cancel our orders. She literally started to beg, (this is not our policy to let go our customers in angry mood) She politely brought us up, and we were seated again. She called in for the waiter, who said, he has not proceeded with the order (next thing we witnessed there was a mob-fight-between-staff/waiters-entering in the kitchen. A very disturbing view, which made me no other choice to leave, again. We drove to Nandos Pakistan SMCHS who made our lives much easier and delivered their best, not commenting on their recent quality though.\n\nSecond episode at Capsicum. Last night we walked in and got a table for 3. We ordered food for 2 and our 3rd friend, only ordered dessert. We specified that all the items should be served together. (service went wrong). The dessert was an over cooked brownie with no or almost melted icecream, and they perhaps forgot to serve the tea, which they did, while we ordered the bill. Poor service from the waiters. But food was good.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-05T06:16:10+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-05T08:32:17+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"628851490499338","from":{"name":"Zara Saleem","id":"727715359"},"message":"Baneen Got your answer?

A quaint little place tucked away in Khadda Market.  Called up a few minutes in advance for a table of 3, and the management was courteous enough to have a table ready. \n\nThe place has really nice ambiance, is tastefully done, plays good contemporary music, and has adequate lighting.  Just the perfect place for a quick casual meal.\n\nOrdered the Flame Grilled Chicken, and that was bloody delicious.  It ensured that the chicken's sacrifice was not in vain.  The chicken was super flavorful, and every little square inch of the chicken had its own distinct flavor.  The chicken was juicy, and it never went dry.  The meal certainly did justice to its nomenclature.  The chicken was served with assortments that complemented the meal, and a fresh, soft, and fluffy pita.\n\nAlso ordered the Lightweight Chicken Shawarma, and that seemed to be a disaster.  The chicken was bland, dry, and tasteless.  The only saving grace was the pita, and hummus.  I would personally avoid the Shawarma next time around.  \n\nDefinitely becoming a regular at Rowtisserie for its Flame Grilled Chicken.

Yes, yes, I know. Abhi tak try nahin kiya tha, but better late than never, right? So we ordered both the flame-grilled quarter chicken and the Row chicken, also quarter. Along with it came the assortment of pickles and sauces, white pita, and the roasted garlic and tomato soup, which was the soup of the day.\nThe soup was a wonderful surprise. Peppery, sweet with the roasted garlic, with proper tomatoey texture and just the right amount of sour to go with the sweetness of the garlic and the heat from the black pepper, this is not a soup for the fainthearted! If you prefer the weak, watered down, ketchupy versions of our local tomato soup, please refrain from trying this soup out. One can tell when 'propah propah' tomatoes have been used in a soup. This was the duchess of 'propah'. \nEverything was flavorful, and had that slow roast, tender, juicy yummy chicken love coming through. The Row sauce did remind me a bit of the Nandos sauces, but somehow better, less spicy and tangy, yet more robust and well-rounded in flavor. \nThe pickles were fresh, crunchy, vinegary deliciousness.  The pita bread, thicker than I would have preferred, and was cast aside after the first bite, since it diluted and cut back the flavors of the chicken. \nDespite the higher price pointing, I would definitely go back for more of Rowtisserie.

completely understand .\n\nWe were a group of 7 ....3 of us arrived early and there was a 20 min wait ..but we waited as the rest of our friends had not arrived anyway .\nSo I was sitting on the bench in the waiting area when all of a sudden some aunties looked at me n started screaming .Apparently a rat went by me n I did not see it ..a rat !!! I should have left  immediately ..\nBut the daredevils that we are ,we decided to stay !\nNow for the food .where do I start ? \n The peri bites ..has anyone else noticed that each year they get smaller n smaller??.and it's not just seasonal !! \nWell ,we complained n we were told will get more pieces then another waiter says that manager is not agreeing .We asked for the manager but he did not come ..\nNext my friend ordered Lemon and herb chicken and got mild flavored chicken instead !! And the waiter insisted that this is lemon and herb and that their sauces have changed .After much argument he took it back and it seemed like they just washed the sauce n brought it back .they just did not have the lemon n herb sauce that's promised on their menu .\n\nIcing on the cake when the bill came we were charged for an extra dish that we did not order !!!\n\nI don't even want to get into the whole ordeal that we went through when they did not calculate our discount on the credit card correctly ..and yes for this the manager showed up !!!\nOh ya and 3 of us are sick today !!!\n\nSadly going out for dinner has become quiet tedious instead of the relaxing pleasant experience it should be .i understand that Nandos  is fast food but it use to be very nice when it first started !! from service to food to everything !","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-26T09:36:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-26T13:52:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"843620452","name":"Rustom H Irani"},{"id":"511194814","name":"Rashna Karanjia"},{"id":"100001881992250","name":"Anum Rasheed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxODgxOTkyMjUw","before":"ODQzNjIwNDUy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"609907579060396","from":{"name":"Rashna Karanjia","id":"511194814"},"message":"Extremely disappointing experience!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-26T12:49:07+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"609929349058219","from":{"name":"Tahir Karimi","id":"667185780"},"message":"nandoes isn't worth paying the amount they charge for what they serve you..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-26T13:52:15+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA5OTI5MzQ5MDU4MjE5","before":"NjA5OTA3NTc5MDYwMzk2"}}},"restaurantName":"Nandos"},{"id":"165861103465048_609533879097766","from":{"name":"Aisha Godil","id":"747680244"},"message":"Ordered Nandos cake at 8:23 pm .

The quarter chicken leg was quite small which was replaced. I do want to mention the energy and the exemplary service of the servers throughout iftar...I felt so bad calling my server again and again for refills and I apologized too but she just smiled and said no need to apologize.....they were short of garlic sauce but mild+wildherb has the same amazing effect....so all good. Came back home and spoke about my experience so much that my sister started craving for it like hell..she called up her friend and they went to the boat basin branch at 12am (tee hee). And she came back smiling from ear to ear and saying 'life is beautiful' hahaha.....Nandos does that to people I guess \u003c3 Her friend was also equally ecstatic about the food experience...so yeah Nandos made 4 people definitely happy today \u003c3 Yay!

I had both steam chicken and flamed grilled one. Not much of a difference, guess its personal choice what to opt for. Both the chicken flavours were to the core, perfectly tender, no blackened skin and proportion smaller (if compared to Nandos). Sideline Mash potato, rice and corn all of them were good but serving them on flat plate made them cold quicker. We had chocolate Eclair as desert, pastry was hard, cream didn't feel fresh & light so I had better then this. Now the price or value for money I would rate 6/10. If you compare it with Nandos where quarter chicken is Rs240 then they servinf for Rs425 (though it is served with garlic sauce, row sauce, tabouleh, pickle & pita) but still this shouldn't increase the price so much.

Place was PACKED. Kudos to the staff for excellent crowd management - very organized and efficient and very polite, even if delays were happening in getting people seats and people were getting restless. However, kitchen was in bad shape. Food was cold, the Espetada was completely tasteless and needed serious dipping in Nandos sauce for any taste (even salt). This isn't the first time I've been to the Boat Basin outlet and gotten cold food. It seems they just cannot handle large crowds. Recommendation: If the place is even moderately full, don't eat there. Save yourself the grief. Buy the Nandos sauce and go elsewhere. Do say hello the staff though - they're a great bunch of people.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-24T06:13:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-25T05:37:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"543845188","name":"Hafsa Azhar"},{"id":"1323939465","name":"Faisal Jawaid"},{"id":"100003292663002","name":"Haris A Amin"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

PATHETIC with a capital P. I did tag the damn location but it didn't appear here :( and neither did my cute emoticon :p\n\nKher. Firstly, it was the 10th iftar yesterday so there should not have been the problems that occurred yesterday, The menu was chicken in sticky red sauce, manchurian, fish tamarind, beef chilli gravy and vegetable rice. \n\nWe were the 1st ones to arrive...around 630ish. The place is tiny and cosy in the first look. The wall and ceiling look cool. Every and I mean EVERY single chinese place I have been to has the soya sauce, vinegar with chillies and red chilli sauce but not at Lantern. Anyways. the place was houseful by iftar time and even the tables outside were filled. We thought its a promising sign. \n\nIftar platters were placed with literally miskeen looking drumsticks. They had ZERO salt in them so all went back. The chicken meatball thingys were consumed by 1 of us, the other 4 didnt like the hardness and no-taste fact. The only saving grace were the fried wontons. Missed GD a lot at tht time. \n\nOh there was no TV, no announcement - nothing about the iftar time. AND no arrangement for prayers for ladies. The server had very conveniently informed us that u can go pray with the men in the garden and we were like  ----\u003e :o\n\nOk, then a server comes and takes our order of soup. Options: Hot n Sour Red and white. We ordered both. All I'll say about the soups is that usually the red chilli sauce and vinegar and soya sauce makes the worst of soups consumable. BUT not Lantern. Firstly the sauces came when the soups got cold...and they were the most bland and horrible tasting soups I have tasted. I mean places like Karachi Broast and Chips have served me with better tasting soups.\n\nWe asked the server can we eat coz it was 8 already. (There were 2 tables who were still asking for their soups at 8...poor souls). He said yes and when we reached, all the silver thingys were empty. 2 minutes later, the food (labelled on the silver lids) came but was incorrectly placed and a lot of food was spilled all over the table. I swear I felt like I was in some shadi hall at that time.\n\nNot too much of a fish person, I took the other 3 things. The Beef Chilli Gravy, like the soups were bland and utterly disappointing. The chicken in red sticky sauce had to be cut with steak knives. The sauce was just ok. Not worth the calories. The Manchurian was nice. Thank God, I could at least eat SOMETHING from the table.

PATHETIC with a capital P. I did tag the damn location but it didn't appear here :( and neither did my cute emoticon :p\n\nKher. Firstly, it was the 10th iftar yesterday so there should not have been the problems that occurred yesterday, The menu was chicken in sticky red sauce, manchurian, fish tamarind, beef chilli gravy and vegetable rice. \n\nWe were the 1st ones to arrive...around 630ish. The place is tiny and cosy in the first look. The wall and ceiling look cool. Every and I mean EVERY single chinese place I have been to has the soya sauce, vinegar with chillies and red chilli sauce but not at Lantern. Anyways. the place was houseful by iftar time and even the tables outside were filled. We thought its a promising sign. \n\nIftar platters were placed with literally miskeen looking drumsticks. They had ZERO salt in them so all went back. The chicken meatball thingys were consumed by 1 of us, the other 4 didnt like the hardness and no-taste fact. The only saving grace were the fried wontons. Missed GD a lot at tht time. \n\nOh there was no TV, no announcement - nothing about the iftar time. AND no arrangement for prayers for ladies. The server had very conveniently informed us that u can go pray with the men in the garden and we were like  ----\u003e :o\n\nOk, then a server comes and takes our order of soup. Options: Hot n Sour Red and white. We ordered both. All I'll say about the soups is that usually the red chilli sauce and vinegar and soya sauce makes the worst of soups consumable. BUT not Lantern. Firstly the sauces came when the soups got cold...and they were the most bland and horrible tasting soups I have tasted. I mean places like Karachi Broast and Chips have served me with better tasting soups.\n\nWe asked the server can we eat coz it was 8 already. (There were 2 tables who were still asking for their soups at 8...poor souls). He said yes and when we reached, all the silver thingys were empty. 2 minutes later, the food (labelled on the silver lids) came but was incorrectly placed and a lot of food was spilled all over the table. I swear I felt like I was in some shadi hall at that time.\n\nNot too much of a fish person, I took the other 3 things. The Beef Chilli Gravy, like the soups were bland and utterly disappointing. The chicken in red sticky sauce had to be cut with steak knives. The sauce was just ok. Not worth the calories. The Manchurian was nice. Thank God, I could at least eat SOMETHING from the table. When I went for the second round, none of the dishes had meat in them and no one had bothered to check.\n\nThe operations manager had apologized for the mishaps saying today everything was going wrong. Well, after paying 970 per head, not even 1 of us wanted to give them any benefit of doubt. The comment card was photocopied with stuff doodled behind it.

I had been craving chicken all day hence decided to order Rowtisserie chicken, reason being I don't like Damascus's overly salted chicken and was not in the mood for Nandos. Also I had only ordered from Rowtisserie one time when they had opened and the chicken came in 1.5 hours and was dry despite that I thought I'd give them another shot.\n\nI ordered the Rower's Meal II which included half a rotisserie chicken, Row sauce, Garlic sauce, Tabouleh, pickles, Pita bread, 2 sides of my choice and two drinks. I chose mash & gravy and hummus plus an additional heavy garlic sauce.\n\nThe order taker had told me 40 to 45 minutes for delivery so I expected at least an hour but to my surprise the food was delivered in 30 ! My grumbling tummy couldn't be more thankful.\n\nThe chicken was small but succulent, moist and not overly seasoned, just the right amount of spices gave it that wonderful flavour.  The mash & gravy was very creamy and delicious but I think the gravy could use beef stock in it. My favourite part was dipping the chicken in the Row sauce and then the garlic sauce both extremely flavourful....I'm salivating just by typing this ! The Tabouleh was fresh and a perfect accompaniment to the meal. The Hummus was the only thing I didn't like, it was too pungent and not smooth in flavour, also I would have liked an olive garnishing on top. The pita was fresh, I gobbled it up with the extra garlic sauce I had ordered. I was left feeling happy and satiated.\n\nKeeping in mind three things, taste, quality and service, I give them 8.5 /10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-19T16:10:10+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-20T05:35:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"647150297","name":"Mehreen Faisal"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NjQ3MTUwMjk3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"543415832376238","from":{"name":"Kashif Malim","id":"766095724"},"message":"Do you have a link to their page or website?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:15:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543429935708161","from":{"name":"Sana Sultan","id":"1519922458"},"message":"https://www.facebook.com/Rowtisserie?fref\u003dts","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:22:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543430325708122","from":{"name":"Kashif Malim","id":"766095724"},"message":"Thanks Sana :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:24:01+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1519922458","name":"Sana","type":"user","offset":7,"length":4}]},{"id":"543435195707635","from":{"name":"Mohsin Makki","id":"667511058"},"message":"sana for how much?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T16:42:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543445595706595","from":{"name":"Sana Sultan","id":"1519922458"},"message":"1345/-","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T17:20:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543455882372233","from":{"name":"Mohsin Makki","id":"667511058"},"message":"not bad :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-19T17:53:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543752059009282","from":{"name":"Hassan Farook","id":"621215659"},"message":"as you have mentioned that you did skip 2 of your meals I am sure it would have tasted better","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-20T05:35:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNzUyMDU5MDA5Mjgy","before":"NTQzNDE1ODMyMzc2MjM4"}}},"restaurantName":"Nandos"},{"id":"165861103465048_536109983106823","from":{"name":"Aziz Ahmed","id":"100000248499872"},"message":"I was fascinated to know that the tea people (Tapal) are behind the chicken (Nando's).

Anyways, not to dwell into farewell depression, i tried my best to cover all eateries as i could. Summary and ranking goes like:\n\nNew places:\n1. Bella vita- great gelato and a very different pizza! Must visit\n\n2. Kolachi- full marks for ambience( despite 50min wait) and one if the best beef botis, though garlic rice were a big disappointment! Karahi was great!\n\n3. Olivetto- tried there pan asian prawns with rice! Sluurrpp! Veryyyyy nice and must try!\n\n4. Xanders- very nice tomato soup and calamari starter, but the menu lacked depth for dinner. Suggest it to be a breakfast/brunch place thn dinners. Ordered jalape?o chicken pizza but the staff mistakenly served margarita. But they were courteous and apologetic! Hence, forgiven.\n\nOldies which are still goldies:\n\nNo one can beat Zahid ki nihari with garam garam naan still!!!\n\nBots was supreme!! The food covered up for poor service! Honestly, once it arrived (prawn karahi, fried pangush fish, fried prawns)we forgot tht it took ages to get someone to clean the table and take thr order. Ad always, didnt disappoint at all.\n\nTai pan- suprisingly great lunch food! Unlike many years ago whn i went and got served with a bee in the soup :) but this time,everything was awesome.\n\nGlorias beef chilli wrap also was a fav this trip!\n\nBoat basin ka subah ka halwa puri had still maintained its 'to die for' value! The dhaba roadside fun i miss!\n\nNandos- lemme tell you this, pakistans nandos takes the prize of the best nandos around! The depth in menu and the taste is what makes it the best!\n\nDynasty- unfotunately trip to dynasty was marred by sudden bout of sickness, and getting all food packed without even looking- the other disappointment was one of the best hotels in town didnt have panadol in first aid, and the pharmacy hd closed at 9! Made me wonder, wat wud guests do if they needed it in middle of night.\n\nChairman mao- no compromise on quality- still the same good hot n sour soup, chicken schezuan and fried rice!\n\nChatkharay and gazebo- never fail to bring your taste buds alive with the bun kabab, chaat and qeema!\n\nAnddd pompei- blue cheese pizza rocks my socks :)\n\nYummmmm! Just writing abt all these places is making me want them!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-02T18:50:16+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-02T18:50:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"552709635","name":"Tubaa Mansoor"},{"id":"634769006","name":"Nida Mansoor"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"673105463","name":"Fatima Baig"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"1160136117","name":"Shehni Kamran"},{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid"},{"id":"515852871","name":"Wasil Sami Khan"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"514440277","name":"M?ri?

Golden Dragon - My new love for Thai and Chinese food. Hot favourites: American Chopsuey, Crispy Beef, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Hot and Sour Soup, Thai Soup, Thai Green Curry, Wontons, Zingers and Chicken Karhai (the last two from their Lunch Xpress section)\n\n2. Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb's warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I'm not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away.

Ordered 2 quarter chicken meals, a salad and a burger meal, at Muhammad Ali Society outlet, and they handed the office driver the \"quarter chicken? only burger and salad came fine they did not take down the ordered correctly. So there we go, the guest got just the chicken, no sidelines!!! Discovering it at lunch table not only frustrated and angered me, but embarassed in front of the valued visitors who insisted on eating Nandos following nandos pictures on my fanpage album.\n \nUpon calling: the restaurant rep apologised but that would not straighten a screwed up of highly important business lunch, we have to send the driver back to buy the sidelines again that came after the lunch. \nNandos I can never forgive your oversight and poor customer service.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-01T13:27:13+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-02T16:50:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NjcwMTAwMTk4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"270055943045563","from":{"name":"Fizza Saleem","id":"100002160879033"},"message":"nandos takeaway is not good. its nothin like eating there..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-02T06:31:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"270123696372121","from":{"name":"Nandos Pakistan","id":"100000605305028"},"message":"Farah S.

Kamal, we've investigated at our end and there seems to be a bit of a misunderstanding on your part. Your driver came to us with the menu with items ticked on it. On seeing the chicken meals, our order taker asked the driver to give her your number so she can ask about the sidelines as they were not mentioned i.e not ticked. Your driver didn't feel comfortable in sharing your number and did not give the number out, but said just give chicken only. After a while he came again to buy the sidelines. Your driver paid for the sidelines the second time and the initial order we did not charge the sidelines to you so clearly you didn't order the sidelines to begin with.\nThe order-taker also pointed this out to your driver that he should have given her the number when she asked him and she would have asked you directly in the first place to avoid this back and forth. We're still sorry as your lunch experience was ruined but the oversight was at your end not ours. Our restaurant also confirms that there wasn't any call placed at the restaurant from you. Perhaps you called the UAN which may have been received by a different rep who may have apologized as any complain is handled with a note of apology to begin with. We conclude that its wrong to imply that we are at fault, there was an oversight yes, but not from our end. We hope our follow up shows that we are very concerned about any level of complain and take customer service seriously.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-02T12:37:27+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100000391823197","name":"Farah S.

The driver indeed did not give my number since i was in a meeting the driver made a call to our Admin Officer-- Mr. Naeem, who explained the sidelnes of rice and prerry wedges to the women on the other side. I never said they charged for the full meal, they indeed charged for the chicken only, but the order was taken wrong. My office is only a block away and we are more then happy to have all the parties in front of each other to resolve this case. I wrote this complain after the full investigation, the oversight was indeed from your side and you all are indeed at fault.
