(My dad is an ultimate nakhray wale uncle:p like the one who calls a steak gosht ka tukda, a pizza 'roti utay boti' and so on) so I always opt for desi with dad since he tends to be very particular with expense directly proportional to taste! Went for an early dinner to Khanji and were seated immediately (1. the weather was lovely, I loved how I ate desi with those back support chairs I could sink into after a long tedious day). Moving to the menu, really extensive, efficiently put together... Ordered Mutton Peshaweri Karhai, Shish Taouk...on asking about the serving we were told there would be 6 pieces so we order yet another 2 items (we dint know they wudnt be tiny pieces, instead king kong pieces) ordered fish tikka and Namkeen Boti. Dad was disappointed for no tandoori roti and only having chapati as an option! Waiter immediately said they can get from another eatery and so we ordered both\nPumpkin Meetha(I don't eat pumpkins, cant say much :))\nThe POST MORTEM:\nMutton Peshaweri Karhai: Nothing like those al habib or Kolachi tastes! Distinct flavors, loved how tender the meat was (I do not eat mutton apart from home but i surprisingly did!). Maybe the right tinge of Peshawer 10/10\n\nNamkeem Boti: I thought they'd be somehow salty (Namkeem wohi hota hai na?) But I think well marinated Chicken with an unbelievably managed execution, 10/10\n\nShish Taouk: A different version of Malai Boti, perhaps with some arabic spices maybe? (y m i being a chef? lol I'd rate it 8/10)\n\nFarmaishi Chapatti : Loved it, literally chapati had some peshaweri khan baba ki rooh in it maybe? The tandoori rotiz kept sadofying while we had our hands onto the chapati\n\nFish Tikka: Uff...Uff...Uff... I've never had fish as yummy (the desi way, after my mom making the bengali fish with Daal chawal since shez from Dhakka). I literally kept some space so i have a piece in the end and the taste remains while I m driven back home.\n\nTashweeshnaak discovery: All these dishes were in really huge proportions, good salad veges as accompaniments and yes, some creamy 'IRANI' sauce is served with all BBQ items which is somewhat raita and cheese ki sauce as well as i could distinguish the flavors!\n\nFinal Verdict: Highly recommended, get over BBQ tonight or family dawats at do darya, Khanji should just begin delivering, tabaahi hogi:D\nThe bill shows how its pocket friendly too, thats the total for Me,Mom & Dad (3 People)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-12T09:19:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-14T08:36:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000827449826","name":"Shahid Ali"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100006083859539","name":"Muhammad Amir"},{"id":"1377186173","name":"Owais Mahmood"},{"id":"508081630","name":"Maha Anwar"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"1130515361","name":"Sanwal Kazi"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"100002218273783","name":"Sana Nabi"},{"id":"709896077","name":"Asma Asghar"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"1432893682","name":"Shahid Zamir Shaikh"},{"id":"1158113319","name":"Fauzia Gul Durrani-Agha"},{"id":"560380437","name":"Arsalan Siddique"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"616725751","name":"Mona Liza"},{"id":"100003303131853","name":"Samad Fansia"},{"id":"100002505633547","name":"Umme Kulsoom Khalid Ahmed"},{"id":"1574269235","name":"Sehar Fahim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTU3NDI2OTIzNQ\u003d\u003d","before":"MTAwMDAwODI3NDQ5ODI2"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_632543486796805/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTU3NDI2OTIzNQ%3D%3D"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"632545416796612","from":{"name":"Whack Attack","id":"715820863"},"message":"where ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T09:23:58+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632548826796271","from":{"name":"Danish Saeed","id":"591051922"},"message":"leave the food.. i've started liking the way u write reviews.good one girl... specially the terminology..\"TASHWEESHNAAK DISCOVERY\"","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T09:34:44+0000","like_count":18,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632549150129572","from":{"name":"Whack Attack","id":"715820863"},"message":"and it looks that the serving is very clean !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T09:36:09+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632549613462859","from":{"name":"Kashan Hanif","id":"786239734"},"message":"^PortGrand","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T09:37:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632550806796073","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"My faaaaaaavorite place!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T09:42:28+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632563066794847","from":{"name":"Obaid Haroon","id":"100000069136891"},"message":"Add Plz Plz.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T10:20:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632568473460973","from":{"name":"Uzma Arif","id":"589340712"},"message":"Aaquib Arif","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T10:36:20+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"632595343458286","from":{"name":"Akber Ali Khaliqdina","id":"511168242"},"message":"based on nicely expressed review... yes must visit now :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T11:05:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632595743458246","from":{"name":"Talha Shahid","id":"668642026"},"message":"Soha: I'm in love with your father :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T11:07:17+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632605600123927","from":{"name":"Sobya Tabish","id":"516131322"},"message":"How was sheesh taouk?

You will find a select variety of similar dishes at The Pakistani (Sherato) and Dumpukht (Marriott) albeit in a limited version. Overall, Karachi does not have too many North Indian/Mughlai food places that are abundantly found in other parts of the world, especiialy UK, Europe, North America and the Middle East. Pakistani food is more onion/tomato based that is grounded in ghee for flavor whereas a lot of North Indian cuisine is texture-based and uses rich thickeners like fresh cream, dried fruit pastes and yogurt as well as pureed forms of vegetables i.e. spinach, palak, onions are usually pureed to create a thick aromatic curry. Some of the dishes you maybe able to find at Nawab would include Chicken Makhni (Indian style), Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Kashmiri, Mutton Roganjosh, Vegetable Makhni, Palak Paneer, Palak Kadai and Dal Makhni (with red beans: rajma) to name just a few. Also, at The Pakistani you can request the chef to make a dish of your choice that's not on the menu and usually he'll fix you something custom to your taste buds (esp if it's a weekday and there aren't too many people around). I so can relate to your craving for this genre of food; too bad the options are limited in Karachi on this one.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-27T18:46:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"625216677529486","from":{"name":"Saba Noor","id":"832395133"},"message":"Thank you so much babar ...

Its just amazing how Mr Big with Egg n Cheese is perfect every time . It feels like they have time frozen the entire process for the last 20 years . Succulent , Flavoursome , Juicy Satisfaction all wrapped up in One little Piece of Heaven. I'd rate it 12/10 , 2 extra points for that smile on my face every time I take the first bite.\n\n2- Al Asif Square : Though a bit risky for some fellows but to be honest the place was packed . We had food at MADINA RESTAURANT which is located inside Al Asif Square and to some people's surprise there were few families around there as well ( well to do families at that ) enjoying food , the atmosphere was friendly we were greeted as warmly as always . We had the famous Dumba Boti , Afghani Pulao , Namkeen Gosht and Karahi.  Now i don't want to waste time in describing the brilliance of food . \nThat is the best Authentic Afghani food out there, Period , 11/10 . One extra point for the Afghan brethren for their every gracious hospitality. \n\n3- Tayyabi Restaurant : Located in Hussainabad. It one of the few unsung heroes of Karachi. We ordered Prawn Masala , KataKat , Chicken Chargha Fry, Malai Boti and Tikkas . Food was served a bit late as they prepare all the dishes fresh and from the scratch. \nPrawn Masala is one of the best in town as the prawns just melt in your mouth and mix with that zesty masala . THE DAMN ! \n\nKatakat and Chicken Chargha fry are good too . All in all yet another place you wont come out unsatisfied or cheated, EVER . 8/10 . -2 for the stolen side mirror of my friend's car from the parking :P\n\n4-  The Burger Shack: I have Shake Shack every week so it did not impressed me much. But i'd like to commend the owner for doing the best damn possible thing by cloning a famous international franchise's menu and making it possible to offer taste in it as well. I was not disappointed to say the least. 7/10\n\n5- Cafeela : Simply put , Zahoor bhai you rock . Okra Jalfarezi , Malai Boti , Nathiya Gali Qeema , Shahi Tukray , Chicken Yakhni Pulao are all yum. One of the best value for money in town. \n\nI am a safe eater and a Desi at heart as I get to eat really yummy mum cooked food and these are few of the places I go to eat or get food delivered when I want to eat out. Flying out tonight . Will Miss Karachi as I always do . Tada !","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-25T12:11:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-27T10:31:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"644528865","name":"Shirin Imani"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"647407601","name":"Syeda Rizvi"},{"id":"655910358","name":"Moiz Kazmi"},{"id":"549477264","name":"Junaid Wasti"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"1521133249","name":"Maouz Qazi"},{"id":"504239316","name":"Hala Qureshi"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"591166408","name":"Faisal M.

We had to wait for around a quarter of an hour before any proper seating arrangements were given to us. I ordered a Cream Tikka Pizza based on the reviews i read on Swot. To my surprise they delivered it within 10 minutes and everything was perfect about it,Although my little brother felt that there were less topping of chicken pieces on it but i was completely satisfied by it. One thing which pissed me off was that all the bottles of sauces were uncapped. I called the waiter and asked him to bring new capped bottles and stopped him to takeaway those uncapped ones. Other than that everything was good and acceptable. \nI will rate the food 9 out of 10 and the place 2 out of 10\n\nPlus they need to focus more on hygiene .

Easily enough, an amazing experience. The manager there is one of the most friendly people that I've come across, and at a time when everybody's having their iftaar and eating about, he was polite enough to keep his food on hold and serve us instead. The guy there, Winston was extremely polite and welcoming too, and was quick with the suggestions. In the end, we went for the 'All you can eat' deal, and I have to say, the pizzas there are some of the best that Karachi has to offer. I'm sure the restaurant started out as a direct rival to Pizza Hut, but it has far surpassed them in terms of quality and service. The pizzas were served piping hot right on time, and Winston was even nice enough to get me a salad of his own accord. Their Chicken Tikka, Sicilian Chicken and Fajita are easily the best flavors that you can get anywhere in Karachi. Extremely polite, prompt and to top it all off, the food was absolutely amazing. It's good to see the manager himself taking an interest and asking if everything was okay. More eateries need to focus on customer management and relations, and I was pleasantly surprised that Pizza One pays attention to such fine details. All in all, an amazing experience, and for me, this year's biggest surprise and a must try goes to Pizza One. I've become a total fan of the food and the place itself, and I'd recommend it to anybody whose looking for some real good food and friendly service. For those who are looking for some idea of their taste: Pizza Hut pales in comparison, and yes they are better than 14th Street Pizza.

Had some squash juices and milk roohafza on the table prior Iftar, the iftar menu was fine, later when it came to the mains that is when i started regretting LQ. The food variety was not big and it lacked quality and taste, opted for tempura prawns and there it lied a small prawn in the big oily crispy coating. Then went for some BBQ. It was so so, then found something with a name tag of Shahzada Salim Khas.. on my curiosity i took a bit and there it was Pasta Alfredo. Seriously did the mughals had Pastas at that time LOL. That is some serious Epic Joke. Out of all those dishes around this was re-named. Went on to Fish Tikka, too much salt in it with no such flavors. The chinese almost ended. Then tried Sajji, it did some justice compared to other food. It was later I shifted to Deserts and had some bit of various sweets. The Shahi Tukra had nothing Shahi in them !! The labe shereen was fine others were upto LQ expectations !! The food was seriously low quality and taste, with attentive service. Rs 1250/- per head exclusive drinks. Seriously it does not in any way does justice. Went to Kolachi a week ago and i Must say it was worth every penny. I would give LQ 2/10.

Another person came and gave Menu. We ordered food and they told us that it ll take 30 minuts after Iftaar,Iftar was free as they advertised, they served few things for Iftaar, iwe thought that person ll bring water or drink.... but we no1 bother to come back. So sad there was no water or any other drink.... and You can undrestand that literally we need Water after 15hr Fast\nHowever the place was not full But strange and unusual thing, they inform us after Iftaar that  \"Sorry sir its already finish\"\nServed food around 21:00 after asking again and again becoz we were not able to move any other place. Chicken Tikkah was not juicy and fresh. portion was SMALL, Food is pathetic.\nMy impression was their chef does not know how to cook! specially bbq, but they made their Food Menu to look fancy.\nThey could hardly notice us, took more 9 minuts to serve soft drinks..... and for more bread(naan) when we were waiting, a person came was holding a \"PR\" position with Lame Excuse. He had an unpleasant looking on everyone all the time. Took long time to serve Naan, Took long time to serve. \nThey also have deserts but we didn't even ordered and I can't say anything on this.\nThe service was absolutely disappointing. They were yelling each other  In addition they could hardly notice us when we wanted something (water, more Naan, the bill etc.). in the end waiter was demanding for more TIP\n\nWe spend almost 6000 Rupees (a little more than 1000Rs per person!) but the price is not comparable to the food and service - too much money. In conclusion the whole experience was  VERY BAD, I would never go again to this place for any reason and I don't recommend this restaurant, not even to my worst enemy.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-21T22:49:11+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-22T11:50:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"100002053607278","name":"Hammad Yawer"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"100004934224675","name":"Faisal Raza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDA0OTM0MjI0Njc1","before":"NTI0NDc2NzM1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"589930781058076","from":{"name":"Faisal Raza","id":"100004934224675"},"message":"u paid alot for some good crap my freind!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T22:54:35+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589936487724172","from":{"name":"Ali Faaiz","id":"717105405"},"message":"ya :(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T22:57:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589938001057354","from":{"name":"Hamzah Khan","id":"747525261"},"message":"That's a big waste of money!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T22:58:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589972447720576","from":{"name":"Dania Obaid-Naseem","id":"1241494164"},"message":"n not safe either!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T23:03:26+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589977267720094","from":{"name":"Ali Faaiz","id":"717105405"},"message":"Dania Obaid-Naseem very true bt for best food can go ...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T23:05:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1241494164","name":"Dania Obaid-Naseem","type":"user","offset":0,"length":18}]},{"id":"590068954377592","from":{"name":"Talha Idrees","id":"510349226"},"message":"I visited day before yesterday and had fabulous evening and waiter was also friendly and they did gave us free drink in iftaar...  :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T23:47:35+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590095061041648","from":{"name":"Yasir Hasan","id":"568465423"},"message":"Who with his sane mind will go to the freaking highway for iftar!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T23:59:09+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590095127708308","from":{"name":"Erum Siddiqui","id":"1579891410"},"message":"I guess waiters ko roza lag raha hoga ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T23:59:24+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590111951039959","from":{"name":"Agha Muhammad Asim","id":"100000669698315"},"message":"I disagreed\nI ve visitied in this ramzan,Food was good as usual and they served Iftar free as far as water concerned they gave us Rooh afza instead of water as you know water has some cost there.\nThere are large number of waiters on differnt shifts a one who served us was a nice man.\nI had many visit there every time i satisfied from there service\nI dont know how your experice is bad.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T00:05:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590271514357336","from":{"name":"Ali Faaiz","id":"717105405"},"message":"the person who told us about Al-Habib, was also sad after this kind of Great Service","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T07:02:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590279354356552","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"That is a horrible experience especially for iftari","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T07:31:32+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590279891023165","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"I always have a good experience at Al-Habib Highway................. never went for the iftar though.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T07:33:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590280881023066","from":{"name":"Ali Faaiz","id":"717105405"},"message":"Sajjad Naqvi u r lucky that never went Al-habib for Iftari...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T07:37:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590292631021891","from":{"name":"Rehan Latif","id":"547465214"},"message":"How can two people have such different experiences at the same restaurant. \nVery sorry to hear about how you were treated.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T08:31:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590294747688346","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Rehan Latif the highway restaurants were famous for their great food but have always had poor service.

Ordered around 10:25 and was informed that the pizza would arrive in 55 minutes. The person taking the order was humble and polite and answered all my queries about the flavors patiently. Called up at 11:30 to inquire about the order and was told that the rider was on his way and must be reaching soon. The rider arrived at 11:45 and apologized for the delay. The service is highly praiseworthy regardless of anything. \n\nComing to the food. Ordered half Chicago Style Pizza (Dancing Fajita and Mamma Mia BBQ Chicken) along with Tikka Stix. Glad to find out that someone is offering a 20? Chicago Style Pizza. The pizza was warm but not as hot as it should be or as communicated on the phone. The food was nothing extraordinary and is highly overrated (apologies to all the chamchas and kantaas). The tikka stix were no different from the ordinary tikka flavored pizza served everywhere. The pizza was slightly overcooked. I couldn?t even tell any difference between the two flavors of pizzas ordered. Both tasted exactly the same. Mamma Mia did not have any roasted onions nor did it have red jalapenos (the guy on phone had btw informed me that they had run out of red jalapenos and will be using the green ones instead). The only additional thing fajita had was green chillies. The quality and quantity of the cheese was great. However, they should have been a little more generous with the toppings too. \n\nThe sauces were OK-ish. The colors were quite similar so couldn?t really tell the difference. Would appreciate if they mention the names on the sauces so that it becomes easy to decipher. \n\nOverall, the experience was ok. Would consider ordering again but not anytime soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-21T20:25:50+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-22T10:45:58+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"553305273","name":"Kulsum Wasty"},{"id":"715075127","name":"Amna Nasim Haque"},{"id":"527546745","name":"Muhammad Saad"},{"id":"886255787","name":"Ayaz Arshad"},{"id":"555245062","name":"Anum Shakil"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"523884020","name":"Musfirah Karimi"},{"id":"881375152","name":"Imran Yousuf"},{"id":"694620620","name":"Saba Majed"},{"id":"592564536","name":"Ather Rizvi"},{"id":"1497320748","name":"Fauzia Farhan Hashmat"},{"id":"549225127","name":"Tehmina 'Manna' Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQ5MjI1MTI3","before":"NTUzMzA1Mjcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"574605499257271","from":{"name":"Talha Habib","id":"100001830205217"},"message":"Many ppl have same opinion abt it","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-21T20:54:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"574611312590023","from":{"name":"Saher Shaikh","id":"539145384"},"message":"It's funny how people were giving such rave reviews about this place and now that the people reading the reviews have finally started ordering food from here, they are disappointed.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-21T21:11:53+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"574620615922426","from":{"name":"San'a Mir","id":"27100992"},"message":"That's weird.

Mirage is the only buffet themed restaurant at Do-Darya and is located right next to Kolachi. The ambience is nothing to write about as it?s almost the same as Kolachi, Charcoal, etc. We booked the whole upper deck unanimously for the view and later regretted the decision as the main food stations were downstairs.\nThe food stations are divided into 3 areas. The main food station is at the entrance while the BBQ section is at the upper left corner of the restaurant. The dessert and salad bar is in the top right corner.\nFor the price (Rs. 1000 per person inclusive of 1 soft drink) the food was very good. There were fresh batair?s (better than Lal-Qila?s), fried prawn tempura, Chicken Biryani, Goan Fish Curry, Chapli Kabab, pani puri are just some of the dishes that were tasted. The highlights however were the BBQ and the live chicken Karhai. The BBQ consisted of Chicken Malai Boti, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Chicken Tikka and Beef Namkeen Boti. The Malai Boti was succulent (but a little sweet for my taste) while Reshmi Kabab and Tikka were awesomely cooked (and Thank God not overcooked)  bu the Beef Namkeen Boti stole the show as it literally melted in our mouths.\nThe Karhai also has 4 varieties namely Peneer White, Peshawari Red, Green Masala and Namkeen Red Karhai. All four varieties were delicious and much better than what Kolachi serves.\nThe let down at Mirage were the salad and dessert station due to same variety as other buffets and also fried fish and the pasta dishes.\nOverall we really enjoyed our food and had a fantastic evening.

It was a very bittersweet experience. \nOrdered at 8:30. Was told that the food would arrive at 9:15pm. After 9:30 had struck the clock, I called to be told that the rider had left and should reach in 15 min. 20 min later, I called again only to be told now that they had ruined the half pizza I had ordered and had been forced to remake it. Although I appreciate that they did not send out substandard food, it still upset me that by now it had been over 1hr and 15 min for the food to arrive.  (compared to the 40 min I was told). \nEventually another phone call resulted in the food being delivered at 10:10pm. Almost an entire hour after the delivery time. \n\nNow to the sweet part. I was happy that the food was warm and hot on arrival. We had ordered the full pizza deal and the half pizza deal. I loved their pepperoni and tikka stix, and the spicy buffalo wings were delicious! We had gone with the Fajita and the Beef pizza. Both were very good, extremely cheesy but not stingy with the toppings which is something I've come notice is a problem most places. The toppings were also flavorful and it was fun dipping them in the sauces. The sauces that were served lacked a little punch. I asked for all 10 types but yet they sent me doubles so wasn't able to try the entire range. The jalapeno ranch and the smokey bbq sauces were great but the hot sauce wasn't spicy at all, and the peri mayonnaise was also lacking in flavor. \n\nAll in all a good value for money (Rs 3198) for 2 1.5 Coke, 1.5 20' Pizza, 2 orders of Stix (Pepporoni and Tikka) and 6 Wings and cumulative 15 sauces. \nI would've been happier if they had been prompt with their delivery, but the customer representative was always extremely polite with me even when I was on the verge of losing my cool. \n\nWill be trying it again, however I'll probably order a little earlier next time to get some grace period.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-21T18:30:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-21T19:12:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"550220458","name":"Humayun Azhar"},{"id":"509315108","name":"Daniyal Qazi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5MzE1MTA4","before":"NTUwMjIwNDU4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"544778615573293","from":{"name":"Daniyal Qazi","id":"509315108"},"message":"I can totally relate to what haooened with you.

When we were on our way home we had forgotten about the pizzas when the guy calls me asking to explain the address to him the millionth time. And then i tell him, over the phone, how none of us have any money left for the pizza now that we had the burgers and all. And we honestly had no money. And then i argues with the manager who then called me and i told him in America its \"30 minutes or free\" for pizza delivery. After him trying to negotiate with me and giving me 30-40% off on the pizzas he finally said, \"acha sir aap aise hi lelain\" and we were like whaaat.

Never again!! Admittedly, it was a lot of food for Rs 2000.. One huge pizza (20\" ??) 6 chicken wings, pepperoni sticks, 1.5 litre coke and 10 sauces (we got only 6 though). We order the pizza half-and-half: Godspell Beef Load (salami, pepperoni, seasoned ground beef, mushrooms, black olives, green peppers and roasted onions) and Wicked Blend (Chicken Tikka, Chicken Fajita, Smoky Chicken, Roasted onions and flooring of Green peppers, mushrooms and olives). The pizza was so oily that I wish I had eaten Nihari instead! There was something off about the meat toppings.. the salami was absolutely unchewable, the chicken toppings all seemed to be of one type only unlike the description. The cheese was lacking in taste and in quality. Marinara sauce was almost non-existent, and was also one of the sauces missing from our deal. The pepperoni sticks were a square pizza slice cut into strips with pieces of pepperoni strewn here and there on the cheese topped crust. The only saving grace were the wings which tasted great but were literally minuscule. Given the kind of advertising they are doing, I was expecting to be blown away! But sadly, it turned out to be my worst pizza experience to date!

The service was very prompt, friendly and attentive. But in terms of food, it remained a few notches below the ambrosial feast that I was anticipating given the rave reviews here. \n\nOur spread included:\nCream of Chicken Soup.. Very rich and creamy. The kids loved it!\nPaneer Reshmi Handi.. Delicious, but a tad bit over-rated. Honestly speaking, it tasted just like pasta in white sauce sans the pasta! This was pointed out by my 7-year old, and after that I had a hard time eating it with naan. :/\nSeekh Kababs, Behari Chicken Boneless, and Malai Tikka.. all were good but I've had better! Malai tikka was slightly undercooked. (Seriously!!)\nGarlic naans: the first two were dry and hard, the third one was soft and fluffy (since we had complained about the first batch) and then the fourth one was again like the first two.  \n\nAll food was delivered hot and fresh (barring the naans), and stayed so despite the open air seating. The floor manager was very interested in our feedback and we did point out the shortcomings. \n\nI wouldn't mind going to Kolachi again for its serene and magical surroundings. Perhaps I'll sample the non-desi entr?es next time.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-22T20:47:16+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-23T05:34:13+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"463561057028383","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Saira Malik don't.

This new kid on the block needs lot of time to reach the required level. The area is not really ideal for sitting outdoors so opted for sitting in the car, no proper lighting and seating as it was too sandy. The order was taken promptly but it took twenty minutes to serve it. Fish and Chips was thin and the fish was bland and lacked body, seemed like frozen fillet's fried and served instead of fresh fish, no tarter sauce only chatni. Malai Fish Tikka was good served on four skewers and Fish fillet grilled was ok, thin slice of fillet, masala was more on the surface and didn't sink in. We asked what happened to the bread rolls but they didn't have them so a guy was seen rushing on his motorbike to fetch them and even the ones he managed to get were not fresh, lemon provided was like rock and needed a ton of pressure to yield a few drops. Met the owner a young man who ably dealt with a situation that happened their with some people who should not have been their in the first place, anyways value for money its 5/10,quality of food its 6/10, service is slack and no one asked us after we were served if we required anything. They need to work hard and diversify their menu, no rice, only 38 items on their menu. A lot needs to be done to improve by leaps and bounds starting with the whole ambience of the place.Prices versus value for money, were not competitive. I hope this critique is taken positively and helps the place to improve as a lot is lacking and can be improved upon considering that the location is fantastic with Village on one side and Cineplex right behind, this can yield benefits if measures are taken for improvement.Goodluck!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-01T22:27:39+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-02T14:48:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"726690443","name":"Danial Rizvi"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1473681227","name":"Shabnam Jabbar"},{"id":"100001822097920","name":"Sara Kazmi"},{"id":"543405800","name":"Tahir Wahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNDA1ODAw","before":"MTAwMDAyOTY3NTA0MTU5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"371123056272184","from":{"name":"Saira Qadri","id":"609681937"},"message":"rock and needed a ton of pressure to yield a few drops.......lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-02T10:43:02+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"371184869599336","from":{"name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi","id":"1198831376"},"message":"Lol ....

We ordered the Mezzah Platter, and as usual 5 star to the platter which was awesome, feta and  olives along with humous my favourite on it! As it was just two of us, by the time we were done with bread and platter, we felt stuffed! because both were soo good! Anyhow, i had already ordered Chicken Roulade. and despite being full, i still managed to eat 70% of it because it was veryyyyyy good! and the frnd ordered Braised Lamb--again a large serving however she thought the taste was slightly bland. But i would also discount that we had quite heavily satiated our taste buds with the starters!\n\nAnd well, this did not leave any place for desserts! But overall as usual after 18months, the Okra experience ws still the same! so three cheers for them!\n\nNight time shift was my initiation to Port Gran with 14 other odd frnds and family frm abroad. and what a place it is!!! amazing! makes me feel even more proud of karachi..:):) And i am already eagerly looking forward to the expansion and addition to the place. There was a live Sindhi Musical cultural performance while we were there, which i thought was a great idea, kept the public very entertained, depicted the culture of Sindh and should be continued as well. For dinner, we landed at Chairman Mao, (being their regular customer in my karachi-days for delivery). Ordred Pizza, and well how much i am a fan of Mao, the pizza tasted very mediocre. We ordered Chicken Tikka pizza, and the pizza had too much of chaat masala! whch kind of lowered the taste! so ws slightly disappointed. Then went for Chickn Manchurian and Chicken in Oyester Sauce, both were fine too, but lacked the 'kick' that i used to get after having a Mao-meal! they tasted like a very ordinary meal from a desi-chinese place. Either Mao's port grand branch hs different recipe, or the quality has just deteriorated slightly.\n\nBut the port Grand experience was marvellous! cant wait to be back next year with even better PG!\n\nTommorow's lunch-- Olivetto!!

I was recommended the African Tikka which is their special spices will try that next time. Overall a very good experience, ingredients is fresh, quantity and presentation is superb, they deliver the food in a special box which is different and looks more like a birthday cake carrier. Only that the box was more impressive three days go and kept the food warm till it came home but now the new box is considerably thinner and has space fro air to pass, so the food doesn't stay warm for long. Tooso management the earlier boxes were better. Food is excellent and highly recommended.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-07T22:20:36+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-07T22:20:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"restaurantName":"Tikka"},{"id":"165861103465048_286899104694580","from":{"name":"Sarah Shaikh","id":"700230937"},"message":"worshops + lunch \u003d Red Apple Tikka - 5 stars, Student's Biryani - what was that!!!
