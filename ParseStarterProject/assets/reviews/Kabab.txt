In case you're wondering, I did not just go to a restaurant in Karachi. So I can't really share my experience at one of these that are discussed here.\n\nBut what i will tell you is that I have lived in Karachi for most of my life (well, until I decided to go study engineering at NUST Islamabad). Even more than the lights and the life Karachi resonates with, what I miss the most is food... OUR Food. From the \"ami kay hath ki pakai hwe bhujya\" and Bun Kabab Stalls at Tariq Road to Kolachi at the rocks, every bite has had a special taste to it- one that is simply absent from the food that I eat here.\n\nPlease don't misunderstand me. Islamabad has some amazing restaurants. Chai khaana and Kitchen Cuisine, for instance, are worth a try. But the taste, the mix, the presentation and everything else is something we Karachiites can never settle for.\n\nEveryday, I stare down at food that lacks in spices, add-on veggies, and often in cooking too. After all, the hostel dining hall has to cater to students from all over the country. From what I have inferred, the spice intake generally decreases as you go \"up\" the country.\n\n The Haleem on Saturdays is nowhere near to the one you guys can eat at Burns Road. You would not believe that what I get on Thursdays is Biryani if you've have had a plate at any of the dhabbas or even your own place. The Qorma here? Oh boy if only they would use Shaan Masalas for that.\n\nYou know, I have kind of given up on the restaurants here too (seriously, how can anyone manage to eat  Afghani Burger?) What I now look most forward to is the monthly courier parcel my mom sends me. Yesterday I opened December to find packets of shami kababs, home made spaghetti, and chicken wings ^__^\n\nKarachi is under fire. Karachi is at War. Karachi probably needs a batman . But trust me, you guys still get damn good food to eat. I lost like 6 kg in my first 3 months here. Still haven't managed to recover all of that.\n\nBe grateful for the food you eat;love Karachi for it.\n\nStay safe \u003c3","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-09T20:55:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-10T19:26:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"807153988","name":"Huma Hussan"},{"id":"698480213","name":"Faiza Shafiq"},{"id":"100002459812246","name":"Mumtaz Begum Tejani"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"537798684","name":"Abdul Basit Memon"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"697750147","name":"Mohammad Ismail Asif"},{"id":"672626621","name":"Asad Baig"},{"id":"753624574","name":"Shazmeen Raza"},{"id":"100001993284398","name":"Rumaisa Nasir"},{"id":"650649934","name":"Ashnaa F Khan"},{"id":"564445611","name":"Shahbaz Ali Shueb"},{"id":"100002861468579","name":"Javeria Talal"},{"id":"100006019808344","name":"Anum Ellahi"},{"id":"552958742","name":"Amir Arfeen"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"100001408655261","name":"Faizan Kamran"},{"id":"864385150","name":"Faiz Khalil Shaikh"},{"id":"513198695","name":"Madiha Shiekh"},{"id":"655137222","name":"Hufsa Rizwan"},{"id":"781150340","name":"Huma Baqir"},{"id":"100006538473120","name":"Ali Shujaat"},{"id":"649725153","name":"Ateeb Akber"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ5NzI1MTUz","before":"ODA3MTUzOTg4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_664275373623616/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjQ5NzI1MTUz"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"664372816947205","from":{"name":"Faiz Rahila","id":"681048718"},"message":"Very well said Hassan.

I guess its a new place and will overcome most of these teething issues.\n\nWorth giving it a try....:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-23T06:51:51+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"623131921071295","from":{"name":"Danish Raza","id":"578840177"},"message":"Guys do try the drink called \"Load Shedding\" its AMAZING,","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-23T06:52:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"623137087737445","from":{"name":"Ufaq Ashfaque","id":"594796590"},"message":"Had it.

And fell in loveee with the concept, the dauntless and audacious brand personality, the execution and the ambiance. Ordered their Besharam Topless Burger, naturally, and fell in love with that too ? sans the egg (don?t know if I intend the pun). Chose SB again this Saturday - a very special occasion - because I'd loved it that much the first time around. Upon arriving we could see that it was overcrowded and were told to wait for a bit, which was perfectly fine considering it was a Saturday night. \nI found it really sweet that the owner's family/acquaintances were helping him out with managing the overburdened situation. The owner himself was doing the rounds and serving people where needed. As our wait prolonged, we asked a lady who was helping out with the management if it was possible that we could place our order while we waited to be seated ? a query to which a simple yes or no answer could have sufficed. Her reply ?No we are not taking any orders. Please be patient? did not sit well with me; however, I let it go, attributing her biting tone and reply to the stressful situation that she was in.\n\nOnce seated we had to wait for a looooonnnngggggg time for the food to arrive. After an hour or so had passed, the same lady came by to ask us if ?everything was fine?. At which I told her that obviously it wasn?t since we had been waiting that long for a bun kebab and Panini ? an order which the waiter himself admitted doesn?t take longer than 10 minutes to prepare. She stated that the food ?would take long?; the frankness of the offered truth could have been appreciated if only she hadn?t added to my fianc? ?don?t look so unhappy, you WILL get food?.\n\nShortly after, we overheard the same lady asking this couple seated next to us if she could take an empty chair off their table. At which they told her they might need it later as they were expecting someone to join them. The lady unpleasantly started interrogating them about how many people they had said they wanted a table for when they had requested to be seated etc. \n\nWe had reached SB at 9.15 pm, and were finally served the bun kebab and Panini at 10.50 pm. The bun kebab was comparable to Roadside?s Dhaga Bun Kabab (which I LOVE), the Hunter Chicken Panini was quite frankly very disgusting and tasted (and smelled) of raw chicken. After we were done eating, I walked to the counter myself to get the bill as I wasn?t too keen on waiting further. The owner upon seeing this offered to get the bill over himself, which was considerate of him. Before he put the box in which the bill was encased down properly, he turned and walked off, sort of dropping the case onto the table.\n\nI didn?t mind the wait. I didn?t mind the bland and raw Panini. They are new and it was probably one of the first times they were handling such a constant influx of customers. They were understaffed. But none of these can be justification of being rude to a customer. Good and bad service notwithstanding, assuming a patronizing attitude can prove to be suicidal for a service oriented business. We went to buy ourselves dinner, we did not go to be preached a lesson of patience or to be treated like we were there for a freebie. To that hyper lady, I would only say that when I go to work every weekday morning, I leave my attitude and any delusional notions of the world revolving around me behind at home. I suggest she do the same. To the owner, I love your restaurant, I really do, but don?t see myself coming around anymore. Do remember that in this industry, the customer ought to be the king, so don?t please sit on that throne yourself.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-16T10:08:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-16T11:07:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"611865533","name":"Shayan Mehboob"},{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"614144691","name":"Saman Ishan"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"531056010","name":"Samreen Feroz"},{"id":"577409061","name":"Maaz Jamal"},{"id":"783794861","name":"Ayesha Oosman"},{"id":"712230730","name":"Hammad Ahmed"},{"id":"524665437","name":"Saher Najam"},{"id":"592929129","name":"Aqsa Jaliawala"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTkyOTI5MTI5","before":"NjExODY1NTMz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619549764762844","from":{"name":"Abdul Shakoor Motiwala","id":"590540852"},"message":"check my review i was there on Saturday too you are too kind with your words","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T10:27:23+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619553031429184","from":{"name":"Sheeza Ahmed","id":"552305433"},"message":"Its a pity, considering the energy-infused and refreshing menu that they have to offer.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T10:40:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619553401429147","from":{"name":"Samreen Feroz","id":"531056010"},"message":"Consistency is THE trait of a winner.

We went around ten and it was crowded. We went inside and a sweet older lady told us to please give her two minutes to sort out a table for 5. We politely said sure take your time. Another waiter came over and again told us we will just arrange something. We were totally okay to wait. Then a few minutes later another lady came who was rather rude said, \"It will take 20 minutes.\" We told her that the other lady and waiter just said that they were arranging something. She again rudely said, \"no it will take 20 minutes. You can see if you want to wait.\" We did not appreciate the tone but we saw some friends on two tables that were placed right at the end of restaurant. Next to the door through which you get to the bathroom. So we went over to chit chat.\nThat lady came back to us in 5 minutes and very rudely said, \" Will you please settle down. I told you it will be twenty minutes. You are disturbing my customers. I need you all to settle down.\" This was highly offensive. We are a group of 30 year olds who were just chit chatting with some friends. Definitely not being rowdy and not getting in anyones way. The place which was quite loud itself, I'm sure a couple of voices did not raise the roof. The two tables were all our friends and the other tables were at a distance from us so I looked around to see who we were disturbing and surely no -one gave a darn about us being there. On her comment, I wanted to ask her, \" Do we not look like customers to you?\" But we even let that one go. \nMy husband asked if she could arrange 5 chairs around these two tables just because they were placed as such. She rudely said, \"No\". My husband suggested one small table could be accommodated there. She gave him the look of death like he had lost his mind. She again rudely said, \"NO. We can't pick up tables and move them around. You will just have to wait.\" I don't understand why that was so ridiculous as most places try to accommodate their customers by joining tables and chairs. Even then that could have been said nicely. Our friends started offering us seats to sit with them to which she very rudely said, \"I need you all to settle down. You can't wait here. You have to go outside and wait.\" It was like a teacher talking to a bunch of students like no one is allowed to stand in this place. Everyone must remain seated at all times. It was highly offensive. Again, if we were being rowdy, loud, or getting in anyones way I would have understood her annoyance. But this was ridiculous. Unfortunately, this was the final blow. We decided to leave. Even though by now she was getting some waiters to bring us some chairs but we had enough. Seeing us leave,  she again said, \"It will take twenty minutes\" to which my husband replied, \"No thanks but I just don't like your attitude.\" She was taken aback but continued to argue how there was no attitude. My husband said, \"It's still there.\" She just made a surprised face and then tried to apologize but one of those apologies,\" Im sorry if you thought I was rude!\"  Yeah sure, It was all in our minds! \n It was enough obnoxious behavior to last us for a while. Even though we were all excited to check out this new joint, don't think we are going back any time soon. Unfortunately, these joints should understand that nothing substitutes for good customer service.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T10:59:34+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619558464761974","from":{"name":"Parisa Siddiqi","id":"501377455"},"message":"Sorry for the super long post but still a bit frustrated about it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T11:00:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619559391428548","from":{"name":"Sheeza Ahmed","id":"552305433"},"message":"Hahahaha, sounds like that same woman :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T11:04:21+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619559401428547","from":{"name":"Samreen Feroz","id":"531056010"},"message":"You husband did the super right thing!.

bun kebobs a lot but admit to not really having them past years due to stomach problem risks. One of the best used to be at PIDC near the famous pan walla. When I was going to Govt Commerce in the 80's this was the place we'd go to after school. They don't use a traditional bun but a bohri bread type bread and very nice spicy chutney and no onions or veggies. Incredible bun kebob that can only described as 10/10. I don't know if he's still there and if so whether same standard but worth trying and now that I mentioned it will probably go there again after many a year. Tipu Burger a joke, their chutney very \"peeka\" and no zing to the taste. Like eating plain bread. A friend once took me to a famous guy in Nazimabad called \"Bapu Burger\". I have to say that was amazing. Clean kiosk and incredible rush, maybe 30-40 cars around him. Although he has the shami kebobs his best bun kebob has a thin hunter beef-type patty which is incredible. Someone just opened a bun kebob place clean and hygienic looking next to Chase dept store in Clifton. He says he's from Nazimabad and it looks good.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-01T07:47:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"612528588798295","from":{"name":"DrSyed Farrukh Jamal","id":"749655321"},"message":"Theres one joint somewhere near FB area, rather a bakery called Manama...they serve good bun kababs..\nNasim Ahmed you are 100% right about Tipu!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-01T08:20:09+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"612533092131178","from":{"name":"Kulsoom Qutb","id":"100002056572978"},"message":"MASHALLAH BURGER at tariq road","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-01T08:37:51+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"612756228775531","from":{"name":"Aruna Dawani","id":"720217622"},"message":"Tipu burger has cole slaw/mayonnaise and ketchup in their bun kebabs!!!!!!!!!

Its just amazing how Mr Big with Egg n Cheese is perfect every time . It feels like they have time frozen the entire process for the last 20 years . Succulent , Flavoursome , Juicy Satisfaction all wrapped up in One little Piece of Heaven. I'd rate it 12/10 , 2 extra points for that smile on my face every time I take the first bite.\n\n2- Al Asif Square : Though a bit risky for some fellows but to be honest the place was packed . We had food at MADINA RESTAURANT which is located inside Al Asif Square and to some people's surprise there were few families around there as well ( well to do families at that ) enjoying food , the atmosphere was friendly we were greeted as warmly as always . We had the famous Dumba Boti , Afghani Pulao , Namkeen Gosht and Karahi.  Now i don't want to waste time in describing the brilliance of food . \nThat is the best Authentic Afghani food out there, Period , 11/10 . One extra point for the Afghan brethren for their every gracious hospitality. \n\n3- Tayyabi Restaurant : Located in Hussainabad. It one of the few unsung heroes of Karachi. We ordered Prawn Masala , KataKat , Chicken Chargha Fry, Malai Boti and Tikkas . Food was served a bit late as they prepare all the dishes fresh and from the scratch. \nPrawn Masala is one of the best in town as the prawns just melt in your mouth and mix with that zesty masala . THE DAMN ! \n\nKatakat and Chicken Chargha fry are good too . All in all yet another place you wont come out unsatisfied or cheated, EVER . 8/10 . -2 for the stolen side mirror of my friend's car from the parking :P\n\n4-  The Burger Shack: I have Shake Shack every week so it did not impressed me much. But i'd like to commend the owner for doing the best damn possible thing by cloning a famous international franchise's menu and making it possible to offer taste in it as well. I was not disappointed to say the least. 7/10\n\n5- Cafeela : Simply put , Zahoor bhai you rock . Okra Jalfarezi , Malai Boti , Nathiya Gali Qeema , Shahi Tukray , Chicken Yakhni Pulao are all yum. One of the best value for money in town. \n\nI am a safe eater and a Desi at heart as I get to eat really yummy mum cooked food and these are few of the places I go to eat or get food delivered when I want to eat out. Flying out tonight . Will Miss Karachi as I always do . Tada !","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-25T12:11:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-27T10:31:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"644528865","name":"Shirin Imani"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"647407601","name":"Syeda Rizvi"},{"id":"655910358","name":"Moiz Kazmi"},{"id":"549477264","name":"Junaid Wasti"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"1521133249","name":"Maouz Qazi"},{"id":"504239316","name":"Hala Qureshi"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"591166408","name":"Faisal M.

It is probably one of the few places in Karachi, which continues to innovate, and come up with new product offerings, compared to other places which don't get tired of serving mediocre done-to-death entrees at European prices.\n\nTried the Double Chapli Kabab Burger there, and it was a treat.  The Chapli Kababs were delish, and one doesn't feel bloated, even though they are fried.  The bun-patty (double) was optimal, and one could take a good juicy bite without worrying about a crumbling bun (which is often the case with many burgers).\n\nThe chatni on the side had the right amount of spice, and complemented the overall flavor of the burger.  The burger is in an experimental class of its own, so can't really be compared to other burgers available in the local, and international market.  Adding in some provolone (between the kababs), might accentuate the taste a tad bit more -- but that's just a personal preference.  Overall, a fantastic no-nonsense burger, and is definitely a bargain at PKR370!\n\nWe also ordered Penne Pasta, and well that was a disaster.  The pasta was floating in the sauce, and the flavor was just overpowering.  It was just a badly done dish -- perhaps, not a core competency, so should be avoided.  The ambiance is a bit too gloomy, but the flavor of the Chapli Kababs covers up for it!\n\nHighly recommended for the Chapli Kabab burgers.\n\nOverall rating -- 7.5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-24T10:22:23+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-24T14:03:33+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"541530612","name":"Mehru Ghazi"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"881200022","name":"Amna Alam"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"726076832","name":"Arifa Nasser"},{"id":"769030393","name":"Muhammad Danniyal Jafri"},{"id":"1510273456","name":"Daniyal Khalid"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"100001252885971","name":"Marium Sultana"},{"id":"1165524875","name":"Hiba Anwar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTE2NTUyNDg3NQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NzMyOTE3OTY4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"608929342491553","from":{"name":"Najm Ahmed","id":"885480695"},"message":"Yes I agree.

A place of traditional Desi  Khaba and it is quite famous that they usually eat with their full?. Love to eat ?.Specially Desi Ghee Stuff either its Karahi either its Fish or etc.\nUnfortunately the both guests by profession were Doctor?s even one of them was a highly known surgeon \n@ 9.25 I reached at kolachi before that I had ?NO? reservation I thought its Monday so at Do Darya it will No Crowded at kolachi ..When I reached it was packed jam and on call it was 56# minimum 1 hour wait?\nI know the owner?s Owais very well and even Umair but both of them were not present suddenly I asked from a attendant who else is looking after him. He took Mr.Amir Name I want to that guy directly and I just simply request him that we are four people and I have guest from Lahore and I called Awais for the reservation however I was dishonest  itna to chalta hai na yar!\nYou know what he did he moved us all the way on a prime location on top which was really WOW. It was full moon yesterday and the view was extremely awesome don?t have words to express. \nI order Fish, Grilled BBQ Prawns, Chicken Reshmi Kabab,Peshawari Karahi,?.\nThe best part was they served in once and it was well maintained in temperature, Quality & quantity \nThe Guest was impressed by the Fish Taste!  Usually they had fry fish in Lahore ,Sardar or Bashir Darulmahi wala are best in Lahore but again the difference was fresh water and a Sea Fish.\nI was stunned by the service standards the best part was after every 5-10 minute there was one new attendant coming and asking need anything else sir, you liked the food etc. \nI strongly believe one should have to profuse with his service standards in a completion war either its taste either its services should have to up come with its own standard?s and have the raise the bar which I guess kolachi did in real.\nThe best part wow to WaoOOoo factor was I asked him for the bill which was 11,000 for four people I just had a pause that I took 6000 cash which I thought will be enough I was like Wooooffffffffffff I checked the bill again and call the waiter are you sure it?s mine twice he said ?yes? Sir then I asked again politely just have another confirmation unfortunately the bill was exchanged with other table he made apology on this but I guess it was another great experience with Kolachi?.\nOvais,Umair & Amir, Great Work Guys \nKeep the Bar high and for other Restaurant?s I don?t want you to get disappoint but dear all serious time to think!\nValue against Money !","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-20T09:02:23+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-21T07:01:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"685959051","name":"Ali Hasan"},{"id":"100001252885971","name":"Marium Sultana"},{"id":"1048532624","name":"Syed Nawfil Rahim"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"789225723","name":"Lalarukh Khursheed Farooqui"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"},{"id":"698359177","name":"Mashal Iftikhar"},{"id":"752330337","name":"Faiz Kazi"},{"id":"558178102","name":"Safoora Fahad"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg1NTA1ODY2","before":"NTI0NDc2NzM1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"606461179405036","from":{"name":"Noveen Siddiqui","id":"520455792"},"message":"Lovvvv this post!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T10:26:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606481659402988","from":{"name":"Syed Nawfil Rahim","id":"1048532624"},"message":"Kolachi make you say WOW!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T11:42:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606561942728293","from":{"name":"Huma Zunnoon Khan","id":"100000710303249"},"message":"wondering wat if the bill was correct ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T13:26:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606562169394937","from":{"name":"Huma Zunnoon Khan","id":"100000710303249"},"message":"* wld have been","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T13:27:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606568629394291","from":{"name":"Noveen Siddiqui","id":"520455792"},"message":"Huma kitni buri baat hai...

Picked the burgers up from the 'shack', and had the 'Full House' with Loaded Fries.  The order was ready in like 15 minutes, despite a lot of demand.  They were easily churning out a dozen burgers every 5 minutes.\n\nThe succulent beef patty was probably the best I've had this side of the Suez, and is clearly a couple of notches better than the standard burgers served by fast food joints, including international franchises.  The bun-patt ratio was just perfect, and the buns were fresh.  The condiments were not overflowing, and complemented the overall taste.  And finally the price was pretty reasonable, relative to burgers served by fast food franchises.  Not much to write about fries -- they were just the usual fries, cut in a fancy way.  It will be great if they can provide a choice of burger buns as well!\n\nThe burger can't really compete with gourmet burgers, but its probably the best fast food burger out there, and definitely way better than the eagerly awaited Burger King, and the now mini-Mac of McDonalds.  Hardees is in a different league though, as the patty there is charbroiled. \n\nOverall, a good experience.  Would rate it at 8/10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-04T01:06:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-04T20:00:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"512577683","name":"Salik Sajid"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"810870516","name":"Talha Sufi"},{"id":"901860640","name":"Mohammad Rafil"},{"id":"557576643","name":"Shariq Riaz"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"1579891410","name":"Erum Siddiqui"},{"id":"712751198","name":"Zareen Sultan"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"547005284","name":"Adeel Azhar"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"593385155","name":"Mubashir Zuberi"},{"id":"828050472","name":"Maisam Ali"},{"id":"568465423","name":"Yasir Hasan"},{"id":"500172130","name":"Agha Hamza Pathan"},{"id":"544070599","name":"Farhan Saleem"},{"id":"1285044693","name":"Sami Ibrahim Tamimi"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"600961078","name":"Azzah Sharif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAwOTYxMDc4","before":"NTEyNTc3Njgz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"597862913598196","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"nice review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-04T03:02:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597868500264304","from":{"name":"Em Jay","id":"100000065623735"},"message":"Onion rings are much better than their ordinary fries","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-04T03:22:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597869446930876","from":{"name":"Adnan Yasin","id":"723675110"},"message":"Every burger chain has its own uniqueness except for those who are completely waste of money.\n\nThose who are good ...have at least one burger of different type.\n\nHARDEE'S ......

Mirage is the only buffet themed restaurant at Do-Darya and is located right next to Kolachi. The ambience is nothing to write about as it?s almost the same as Kolachi, Charcoal, etc. We booked the whole upper deck unanimously for the view and later regretted the decision as the main food stations were downstairs.\nThe food stations are divided into 3 areas. The main food station is at the entrance while the BBQ section is at the upper left corner of the restaurant. The dessert and salad bar is in the top right corner.\nFor the price (Rs. 1000 per person inclusive of 1 soft drink) the food was very good. There were fresh batair?s (better than Lal-Qila?s), fried prawn tempura, Chicken Biryani, Goan Fish Curry, Chapli Kabab, pani puri are just some of the dishes that were tasted. The highlights however were the BBQ and the live chicken Karhai. The BBQ consisted of Chicken Malai Boti, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Chicken Tikka and Beef Namkeen Boti. The Malai Boti was succulent (but a little sweet for my taste) while Reshmi Kabab and Tikka were awesomely cooked (and Thank God not overcooked)  bu the Beef Namkeen Boti stole the show as it literally melted in our mouths.\nThe Karhai also has 4 varieties namely Peneer White, Peshawari Red, Green Masala and Namkeen Red Karhai. All four varieties were delicious and much better than what Kolachi serves.\nThe let down at Mirage were the salad and dessert station due to same variety as other buffets and also fried fish and the pasta dishes.\nOverall we really enjoyed our food and had a fantastic evening. Best part was that there was no hassle from the waiters or the mangers to clear the table (like they do at Kolachi & Ginsoy).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-27T18:52:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T09:29:10+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"736425186","name":"Maryam Zahoor Ansari"},{"id":"772910592","name":"Shyam Sunder"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"100000226962956","name":"Sumiaya Arif"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"711050864","name":"Abdul Raheem Khan"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"NzM2NDI1MTg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"548935991824222","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Aaquib Arif","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-27T21:28:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"549210141796807","from":{"name":"Zarfras Siddiki","id":"100003898006618"},"message":"seems they(Kolachi and Ginsoy) are quite busy in their business and they care for walk in customers,to avoid waiting in queue,,caring for customers by Kolachi and Ginsoy thats good,,","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T08:19:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549233218461166","from":{"name":"Muhammed Umer Mulla","id":"595408686"},"message":"Well yes but what if you are in thr middle of a meal and the bill is presented to you or when you try to relax the waiter constantly remind you to clear the table as they have a big cue....I mean can't they wait for say 5 mins","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T09:48:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549380488446439","from":{"name":"Sumiaya Arif","id":"100000226962956"},"message":"I second that muhammed umer mulla","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T14:42:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549876995063455","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"5-7 Mins should be max before which the Bill sould be asked for & settled.

There are some good restaurants that provide good value for money (e.g. kolachi ? from top of my head) but then many other places are charging ridiculous amounts of money that just doesn?t make sense.\n\nE.g. restaurants charging rs.150 for a bottle of mineral water?? Rs.50 for a nan? Just came back from watching a movie on atrium with dad and decided to munch on a few snacks. Ordered chicken Florentine crepe from the stall of ?the crepe factory?. The crepe was for Rs.250 and I decided to just check out how he?s making it cuz of my passion for food. He literally put 4 miniscule quarter bite size chicken bits is all I can say with some wet paste type spinach from the fridge and a small bit of cheese. The chicken smelled putrid and my dad gave up after a few bites. But leaving aside the quantity does it really justify to charge Rs.250 for that?\n\nSimilarly I took a chicken tikka deal from chacha jee which was for Rs. 300. With two small sticks containing chicken thigh barbeques pieces. I mean one can get a decent quarter size chicken tikka for Rs.180-200 from any club?\n\nIn uk there is a law that a customer may pay a certain amount for food that he perceives is the right value for it. E.g. if he has been served rotten food he can pay a pound and leave despite the actual price being much higher. He cant leave without paying that then consitutes as a crime. However legally if taken up he has to prove that it was worth 1 pound.\n\nIs it just me or are restaurants just charging obscenely? I think value for money should be taken up on this forum as an interesting thread discussion that may lead to some restaurant realizing that they need to start setting price points more appropriately!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-14T22:01:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-16T07:54:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"100003553069288","name":"Chanelle Adam Khan"},{"id":"100001822097920","name":"Sara Kazmi"},{"id":"1071574922","name":"Madihah Yunus"},{"id":"680080236","name":"Naiha Zafar"},{"id":"1108385601","name":"Marvi Jatoi"},{"id":"738315558","name":"Talal Yahya"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1464463541","name":"Mehreen Farhan"},{"id":"689771441","name":"Riffat Fawad Bukhari"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"1565510392","name":"Naheed Siddiq"},{"id":"1793536667","name":"Faiza M.

At that moment no body knew about Kabab Rolls they were the one's who introduced and named KABAB ROLL to the people of Karachi... at first people didn't even knew how to open the wrapper of kabab rolls. After their unique taste and popularity they decided to come out of the market and go at a good location so they could promote their unique product to the world. So they rented the place where silver spoon snacks is located now in 1971. As they had a history in restaurants and food they were the 3rd generation in this business. Their Grandfather Late Amjud Ahmed started this business in india in 1910 and made his chains of Amjudia Hotels and Restaurants all over india in his hard worked 20 years and made his company the 1st muslim owned Limited Co. in india as Amjudia Pvt. Ltd. So after partition of the two countries his grand childrens Mojib, Khatib, Habib & Adib followed the tradition and opened the restaurants in karachi. After the big sucess of Silver Spoon Restaurant they needed a bigger place to accommodate and fulfill the needs of their beloved customers so they decided to shift to a bigger place and they shifted on the same road near jheel park and allied bank which was the REAL SILVER SPOON RESTAURANT. And they also opened another popular restaurant by the name of Mojib's Dinner near jheel park. As they shifted the place which is known as silver spoon snacks now was rented by someone else and due to the popularity of the previous business of silver spoon they decided to use the name as it is being used now since then, because in our country u cannot register the name any one can open a silver spoon anywhere in Pakistan without any affiliation. I wold like to ask Mr. Hammad Ur Rehman Awan that please stop misguiding people and by the way mr. awan how could u invent BIHARI KABAB untill or unless you are a behari as they are and they have a history to prove it. We know that you want people to think that you are the real Silver Spoon... Let the taste and quality and the product be the judge of that. Thank You..\n\nI am sorry if i have offended anyone but the truth is the truth!","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-03-20T07:06:13+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-20T12:35:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1655946149","name":"Imtiaz Merchant"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"100001073218879","name":"Talha Ahmed"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"703368408","name":"Irfan Ali Siddiki"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"1626883423","name":"Fatema Murtaza Lacewala"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTYyNjg4MzQyMw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTY1NTk0NjE0OQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"523569157694239","from":{"name":"Ayza Alvi","id":"551492961"},"message":"Why was mojib shut down , I want it back plz","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-20T08:39:58+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"523569707694184","from":{"name":"Luciferz Angel","id":"792470170"},"message":"Mojib's had the best grilled chicken cheese sandwich...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-20T08:42:42+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"523573921027096","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Thanks Talha Ahmed, in fact after the controversy of the other Silver Spoon claiming to be original, I had decided to go and meet Adib Sahib personally to know the history as I am friends with one of his relatives.

My sincerest apologies for your bad experience.  ?Feeling like spitting out food? is never pleasant and next time, best thing would be to send the food back immediately and complain to management. Our aim is to make your dining experience pleasurable and I can assure you, the staff is very friendly and accommodating and would be happy to help, be it the food or the AC. \n\nI know it might sound like an excuse but it might have just been a one-off that happens to every establishment once in awhile. We would love for you to come back and we will see to it that you have a great experience with us. Your name is already at the reception. \n\nSumiaya Arif and Tabinda Salman Please do not reconsider visiting us due to 3 bad reviews. What about the other 60 good ones that don?t appear on this forum? I hope you will give us a chance.\n\nAbid Aziz Merchant: Forty4 is also the bread and butter for all the people involved in the eatery. Just like any other business, we strive for excellence and want to make spending all that money worthwhile and satisfactory. However, just like any other business, sometimes things can go a bit awry, blame it on human error.  \n\nHowever, I do agree that everything else takes a back seat to the food. Ali Mirza I appreciate you liking everything else but naturally, you are there for the food so I cannot stress enough how important it is to tell the staff if things are not to your liking so we can rectify the situation, effective immediately. \n\nRaheel Masood; Thank you for your suggestions for asking management to rectify the issues. The customer is always right and in following that age-old mantra, we are always here to better ourselves and make up for any mistakes. I hope we will be seeing you again. :) \n\nThe management at Forty4 has taken note of all these issues. Thank you for your feedback. I sincerely hope you will give us another chance and for those who have not yet visited, give us our first. :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-11T18:54:55+0000","like_count":15,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"585571679","name":"Kanza Ali","type":"user","offset":0,"length":9},{"id":"559845057","name":"Tabinda Salman","type":"user","offset":769,"length":14},{"id":"840619510","name":"Abid Aziz Merchant","type":"user","offset":945,"length":18},{"id":"504538403","name":"Ali Mirza","type":"user","offset":1344,"length":9}]},{"id":"517998348251320","from":{"name":"Ayesha Chundrigar","id":"665091820"},"message":"Kiran Murad, Owais Thanvi, Rabiya Syed, Maha Khan, I appreciate the vote of confidence from you all and hope to see you all there again! :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-11T18:57:08+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"672466884","name":"Kiran Murad","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11},{"id":"595996119","name":"Owais Thanvi","type":"user","offset":13,"length":12},{"id":"557225252","name":"Maha Khan","type":"user","offset":40,"length":9}]},{"id":"517999681584520","from":{"name":"Ayesha Chundrigar","id":"665091820"},"message":"Nezihe Hussain, here's hoping our restaurant makes it to another ten years with consistency and good food...I want my grandkids to eat there!

I AM SAD :( all this hype and not living up to the mark...... went there today at 12:00...... 4 -5 customers... so were catered to early... Ordered A Fat Chicken Salad, Jalape?o Beef Burger and a Kids meal of Chicken Nuggets....Not a big fan of how they announce the order in a chorus.... just too much noise (imagine if they place if fully filled, how would that sound?) The meal arrived within 15 minutes....the burger was not hot and bland... hubby had to put substantial amount of Tabasco to make it bearable .....his veridvct was that the burger reminds him of Mr. Burger.... the kid's meal consist of 4 medium sized nuggets handful of fries and a tall glass of drink ... in  my opinion its quiet a big size of drink for a child... the kids meal was ok..... Fat chicken salad came without any dressings...... i would normally expect that they would provide some sort of pre -packed dressing with any salad.... it was ok but over priced.......

The kids loved it!\nPaneer Reshmi Handi.. Delicious, but a tad bit over-rated. Honestly speaking, it tasted just like pasta in white sauce sans the pasta! This was pointed out by my 7-year old, and after that I had a hard time eating it with naan. :/\nSeekh Kababs, Behari Chicken Boneless, and Malai Tikka.. all were good but I've had better! Malai tikka was slightly undercooked. (Seriously!!)\nGarlic naans: the first two were dry and hard, the third one was soft and fluffy (since we had complained about the first batch) and then the fourth one was again like the first two.  \n\nAll food was delivered hot and fresh (barring the naans), and stayed so despite the open air seating. The floor manager was very interested in our feedback and we did point out the shortcomings. \n\nI wouldn't mind going to Kolachi again for its serene and magical surroundings.

Never been a big fan but there is a reason its the most popular restaurant in khi.\n\nChips: Roast Beef Burger as good as always, but much smaller than what it use to be. \n\nCafe Flo: The lamb Shang was out of this world in taste and the meet was perfectly cooked. Also had a few bites of their undercut steak, good as usual.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-27T10:31:57+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-27T12:05:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"680185313","name":"Khalid Ishaq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjgwMTg1MzEz","before":"NjgwMTg1MzEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"417474938303662","from":{"name":"Reza Jivani","id":"683105140"},"message":"Try out Kolachi @ seaview, the cafe at pie in sky (zamzama) and Bread Basket for the cheese naan! :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-27T11:03:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417488551635634","from":{"name":"Shaan Agha","id":"517358087"},"message":"I have always been a big fan of pie in the sky cheese cakes.

With the expectation bar at its peak after hearing and reading so much about it on SWOT and outside, I was a bit apprehensive while going. What if it doesn?t turn out as good? What if my grandiose expectations fall flat? Oh well. Nevermind, I reassured myself and our group of 10 with bachas in it went ahead. We reached well after 830pm thanks to the jam packed sea view road that tested both my patience and driving skills. Finally when we reached we were told by the courteous lady at the entrance that we?ll have to wait for anywhere between 30 to 40 minutes to get a table for 10. Though I was warned of the weekend rush that picks up after 830pm my own miscalculation prevented me from pre-booking. Thanks to Muneer Esmail and the ever courteous staff of Kolachi, we managed to get a table well before the time given. And what a lovely spot it was. I could?ve easily spent hours sitting up on the deck overlooking the sea and enjoying the lovely environs. Kolachi cleared its first test with full marks! \n\nThe gentleman who appeared to be the Manager helped us settle and ensured we were comfortable. Our group relied on me to order (knowing fully well that I am the worst at the job). However, thanks to my earlier post on SWOT, I had received some recommendations and decided to play safe. So my pick included Paneer Reshmi Handi, Peshawari Karhai (in Chicken as the group was not inclined towards red meat) and Kolachi Reshmi Kabab. As much as we wanted to try out starters, we chose not too as the popcorns at Cineplex right before the journey to Kolachi didn?t allow that. So we settled on the main course. For this trip only! \n\nBachas in our group are notorious for ordering fries wherever they go! They frown and fret and make a fuss if they don?t find their favorite starter. Fortunately Kolachi didn?t let us down there! Kids were happy with cheesy and Masala fries to start off their meal. For drinks, I went ahead with Muneer?s recommendation and ordered Blue Colada. Some in the group ordered Lemon Mint Glacier while the rest settled for soft drinks or fresh lime. \n\nFood at Kolachi came, saw and conquered! Literally! Paneer Reshmi Handi was well beyond our expectations. It was simply divine! I profusely thanked SWOTTIES who recommended it!! I wanted to devour more than my appetite allowed. And I did. Peshawari Karhai was well cooked and tasted heavenly. With roghni naan, the food was sheer delight. Reshmi Kababs were fresh and tender. They complemented well. \n\nI am forever thankful to Muneer for recommending Blue Colada! It was fantastic. I acted the bad one by not sharing it with anybody which I usually do. The evil me had it all and craved for more!! However I didn?t want to explode so resisted. There was no space left for even tea. So we got up after the lovely food and an excellent service.

Finally ordered and food arrived in an hour after we reached, but once it was served all the pains were forgotten and we virtually drowned in the taste and flavor of the fish karahi, grilled and fried fish and the Chicken Malai boti and Behari Kabab, garlic nans and vegetable rice. Following that was sara's surprise desert neatly packed and presented with finesse, Shahi Tukra's, Caramel Egg pudding and Lab-i-Shireen, Shahi Tukra's were really sweet and well made with Zafraan, illachi and all the works, the caramel pudding was equally good. Lab-i-Shireen needs to be thicker and have some more ingredients in it to make it more original, another good option could be a mango based desert for the summers, even home made mango ice cream is a great option. The addition of desert is great as now one doesn't need rush elsewhere for desert after having Tsunami Prawns and can simply douse their taste buds with Shahi-i-Tukra's.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-17T10:10:37+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-18T19:02:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"667871448","name":"Sheikh Mohammad Faisal"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1473681227","name":"Shabnam Jabbar"},{"id":"543405800","name":"Tahir Wahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNDA1ODAw","before":"MTE5ODgzMTM3Ng\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"399296960121460","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Comprehensive review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T10:25:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399299070121249","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"I need dictionary's support to understand few words.

Aylanto (yeah it's alphabetical : P) because of freshness of ingredients. and best value for money in fine dining. \n2. BarBQ2night: for its (ISO certified) quality, consistency, cleanliness, & of course their German precision food engineering: P     \n3. CBG: oh this requires an academic thesis, or @least a drawing room discussion, a 1liner is not enough.\n4. Patio: cutesy, warm ambiance, gr8 food and different menu4a change. (no its not alphabetical ;P)\n5. Fujiyama: for the best Japanese in town\n6. Desi: best array of desi flavors under one roof, w/ the good looks & charms of a secret recipe, literally : P\n7. BOTS: best sea food variety under the blue sky, second only to the ocean : P\n8. Log Inn Lounge: for the best chill-out Drinks, food, & conversations on food and of course politics : P\n9. Cafe Gracias: for the best authentic Mexican in town! :P\n10. The upper crust: for having the best fro-yo, panini cheese steaks, belgian chocolate/ RVcake ever.        \n11. The Pakistani at Sheraton- great ambiance, attentive service, love the rose water scented pre-dining hand-rinsing, the post-dining paan and dessert trolley, and a wonderful way to impress family and friends visiting from Abroadzzz.\n12. Crescent Nimco in Bahadurabad- great samosas, chaats, jalebis, chai, kahva, and superb selection of nimco items to take home for when you are feeling like DIY-desi snacks.\n13. This is a tie between Tutti-Fruiti, for its unique self-serve experience and sugar fee varieties, and Berrylicious cuz they are simply sugary-sweet and opening up at Port Grand!\n14. Port Grand- clean and fun atmosphere, with smelly-free views of the harbor, nice walking and shopping, good security, and a decent variety of food for all budgets and tastes. Plus, this allows us to hoot and holler (yeah, i almost became a lawyer, like the loophole?) about Aylanto Bistro and Ghaffar Kabab Hoouse, even though the one in Delhi Mercantile is waaaaay better and more generous!\n15. Dynasty- best Chinese.\n16. Hot n Pepper on Bahria- best malai tikkah rolls. ever!\n17. Butlers- for their 'super-sexxxxy-mocha'- yes, you can go there and ask for it, it's basically extra chocolate syrup..\n18. Olivetto- where else can you get the options for fine-dining or lounge, both with excellent menus?\n19. Koel cafe- for their 'fire and ice' drink, which much like the owner, is the quntissential embodiment of Eastern elegance and taste, met with a certain Western and Worldly sophistication. \n20. The dark brown, unsliced, artisan breads at Hyperstar's bakery. their almond croissants (buttery croissants with actual almond paste inside) too, which are available every now and again on sundays.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-12T08:08:35+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-12T15:46:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"689771441","name":"Riffat Fawad Bukhari"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAyODQxNzU4","before":"NTgyOTYwNTc1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"396668170384339","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Fawad.

As this place was primarily a broast chicken joint for the last twenty five years, diversification to healthier option is a good sign.

But it lived up to all the hype. Malai boti was exceptional, possibly best I've ever had. Fry kaba and gola kabab were both out of this world. Perfectly done, flavored BBQ food. If SAG is a 9.5, Zameer Ansari is  9. Didn't like the parathas though. The fried parathas were too crispy, and the lachaydar parathas were also too crispy. Too bad quetta hotel weren't doing parathas at that time.
