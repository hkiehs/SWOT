Out of the three drinks on the buffet - Rooh Afza, Lemonade and Tamarind Juice - the Tamarind juice was a winner for me. \n\nThe dinner buffet opened after an interval, and although the offerings were limited in variety, the taste was mind-blowing! Thai Chicken Curry, Beef Medallions in peppercorn sauce, and Fish & Crab Balls in Chinese Sauce were absolutely finger-looking good, and I wished I had held back on the iftar consumption a little to enjoy the dinner entr?es more. The only glitch was that the garlic rice and chowmein took forever to reload and there were long gaps between refills of the rest of the entr?es too, which led people to constantly hover around the buffet. \n\nThe desserts were an absolute delight as well. Chocolate Brownies, Cream caramel, Fudge Cake, chocolate balls, pineapple cake, and fresh fruits just made for a very indulgent end to the meal, and I even forgot about the Hazelnut Dream Cake that awaited us at home. :)\n\nThis, however, was not the end of the meal! Aman Virjee made a lovely gesture of sending us a complimentary Fudge cake slice with a candle on top and an anniversary wish piped with chocolate on the plate. (Remembered too late to take a picture!) Thank God for the tea that made some room for us to gobble the cake down. \n\nThe attentive service at Forty4 is like the icing on the cake! All of this made for a very lovely evening for our family. I am glad we chose to celebrate our special day at Forty4.  :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-07T23:22:53+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-07T23:22:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"711699788","name":"Sanaa Zubairi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1382900598","name":"Sadia Ibrahim"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"691451746","name":"Ayaz Sheikh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjkxNDUxNzQ2","before":"NzExNjk5Nzg4"}}},"restaurantName":"Juice"},{"id":"165861103465048_419333814784441","from":{"name":"Roomana Nasir","id":"529620428"},"message":"Tried Omung Meethi Lassi yesterday.... ummmmmm.... not sure whether I liked it or not.

The place has 180 seats at three different levels inc a lounge. We started off with Roasted Tomato and Broccoli Soup, for starters we had Spinach and Artichoke Dip, were also served complimentary bread basket, warm and fresh bread, the Soup was good topped with goat's cheese and well flavored. Main course comprised of Kalamata Chicken ? Marinated chicken with kalamata, green olives and sun-dried tomatoes and \nGrilled Fillet of Chicken with Rocket Grilled chicken topped with rocket leaves drizzled in delicate garlic olive served with Saut?ed mushrooms and vegetable timbale. The food was served hot and excellent presentation but the meat needed to be a tad bit more tender. For drinks we had Falsa Juice less sugar, a bit sour but authentic not artificial in flavor. Last but not the least desert was Warm Apple crumble with Ice cream, baked apple pie was a bit hard and required an effort to break but combined with Ice cream was delicious. Service was excellent, staff was polite, attentive and the manager was kind enough to ask us \"How was your meal\". One of the reasons for me to swot this place was to have an objective analysis as to how well team Aylanto is performing! after reading many negative reviews and not many reviews these days, Aylanto finally seems to be on track now, after weathering the storms, as the place was packed with people and they kept coming and coming till about 2:15 pm......which means they are delivering on quality of service.....only one thing seriously needs to be looked into, that is when the bill was presented it was simply on a piece paper with GST being charged at 16% and no proper bill was given with a valid GST no. The server was called and he gave the excuse that the machine was out of order, then the manager was summoned and he gave the excuse that the accountant is not present, and if we need the proper bill we will have to wait, as it will take HALF AND HOUR, then he under took the responsibility to have the bill delivered to our give address, we advised him to make it, scan it, and email it us, he committed he would do so, but unfortunately even after a passage of three hours when I write these lines no proper bill has been emailed. Cafe Aylanto which is one of the most prestigious and respected restaurants in Karachi, has done very well on all counts accept this one. This is a serious matter which they need to investigate and get back asap. If I am being charged GST, it is my right as a customer to insure that it is being accounted for in the proper manner, and not only charged, but accounted for and deposited in the respective gop account. This is not an allegation but an observation, early also they presented a bill which was on a piece of paper and not a properly printed one with GST no, complaint lodged and no action was taken which does not reflect well on this establishment. I am sure someone would like to clarify this issue.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-19T12:49:46+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-19T12:49:46+0000","restaurantName":"Juice"},{"id":"165861103465048_412047652179724","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"China Kitchen - this time around 10/10.

Was also served a complimentary Tamarind Juice Drink which was actually too sweet for my taste and very concentrated so had to mix it with water to bring the right consistency.  Just one suggestion, pls keep a couple of security guards or chowkidars who can keep a watch on the vehicles parked by the customers as on return, one of my guests cars side view mirror was stolen.

The best thing about Gunsmoke was even though it is located in a mall, in no way it gave one the feeling... It is an entity on its own... Overall a brilliant experience, Thank You AC :)\n\np.s: AC's burger in the french 'baguette like bun' was a totally different ball game :) would recommend it highly to people who want to be adventurous with their burgers :) (I Know I would next time that I am there)\n***********************************************************\nAmbareen Khan\nDear fellow swotties..I was on the table next to yours during the Gun Smoke food tasting today. Must say I agree in most part with your reviews. However there were some issues I pointed out. Firstly the cheese nachos were too 'processed' for my taste. They were simply spicy doritos covered in canned cheese dip and salsa. I was told that corn chips were not available locally(??) and therefore they had to stick to doritos. Secondly all of us ordered our burgers with the orginal bun which I feel does not do the juicy burger justice. Again I was told that Dawn is the only option so choice is limited. Salads, a few of them like the eggplant tomato was outstanding, wheras the pasta salad lacked oomph. However would I go again? Most certainly because I feel Gun Smoke will be ironing out minor glitches in no time and will live up to expectations set in part ,but obviously not solely,by its amazing ambience...\n***********************************************************\nAdnaan Chaudhary\nGun Smoke. Perfect wings. Grilled to perfection. The grilled prawn cocktail is divine. The burger in the french baguette bun was awesome. Head grill master personally delivered. Soup was great. Salad bar needs tweaking. Service still rough around the edges. But for day one it was miles ahead of any newbie joint. Prices equate value for money. Harris and kamran sheikh. Your Genesis is standing proud and tall. Bravissimo.\n***********************************************************\nNezihe Hussain\nWhat a day. Strike, heat, humidity all combined couldnt take away the wonderful time spent with fellow swotties....lovers of food. Many a noble bovine race sacrificed their lives for todays gastronomy of protiens.\n\nAt the SWOT Opening (soft) for GUNSMOKES latest venture at Dolmen Mall Clifton, met up to sample their menu and service.\n\nThe place has a fun feel. Perfectly chilled in this weather it was a pleasure to walk into the vibrant alive place.\n\nGun Smoke is synonymous with \"hutke\" \"something different\" and they have lived up to their promise.\n\nThe food thu limitedmin option today since it was a soft opening was really good. The burgers amazing. But i resent the favoritism being shown to lumboo when he got the french baguette bun and i got the regular soft bun.\n\nThe wings thu grilled and not crispy (as i like it) were cooked to perfection and yum. The nachos on the other had were doritos (not nice) the grilled prawns on a stick were perfection and i think even the BOTS spy got some tips.\n\nA place to head to on a hot Karachi summer or just for a bite of something yum. Guns are surely Smoking this time.\n\nWell done Kamran Sheikh and team.\n\nThank you Adnaan Chaudhary for arranging the lunch.\n***********************************************************\nShaikh Fawad\nGuess u guys heard Huh??? Yeah we went to Gun Smoke's- DollmenCity soft VIP opening courtesy AC. Felt a bit superstarish walking in as a line of envious eyes watched in jealousy? or may be in just hunger, as it was Lunch time, and the smell of a burger grill may have been more of a reason for wide&wild-open-eyes than the long list of SWOT celebrities : P.... anyWho, here are the dirty details:\nMuniza and I started w/ the soup and salad. Thought the flavors of the fresh&gr8 ingredients would have been enhanced if more seasoning was applied, but a dash of salt did the trick there:)\nNachos: I really didn?t think that classic Doritos could make such gr8 Nacho?s?talk about authentic : P ? wings were gr8 & perfectly succulent but I prefer both crispy on the outside & succulent on the LogINN,) side.\nBurger: I had the Mushroom Cheese, which was awesome!!! I could tell the cooking- time was something they take into consideration, as I had a perfectly cooked patty that was soft to bite in to : ))))))))))))))))) Muniza had the Pesto Burger & from what she told me it was also excellent :)\nI personally like thick home fries, but the perfectly crispy, skinny ones offered were piping hot, and only needed a dash of salt too make it deliciously savory.\nI thought the falsay drink was fantastic, so was the mint drink, but the former won my heart, as it wasn?t too sugary yet tasted natural and very refreshing!!!\nAll?n all, a gr8 opening!!! congrats Harris, and Kamran on yet another franchise : )\n***********************************************************\nHussain Tariq\nWent on the soft opening of Gun and Smoke on the invitation of Adnaan Chaudhary - Found the place extremely welcoming and lively!! of course had the company of amazing swotties Nezihe Hussain, Shaikh Fawad his lovely wife, Ally Aadil Bhamani Ryeaan Anwar Chaudhary Luciferz Angel and many many more... since it was a soft launch so few hiccups were expected but service was perfectly fine!! Tried a spoon full of doritos in Jalapeno dip (guess they were not served as Nachos) the dip / dressing was spicy and nice..wings were nice crispy and had amazing spicy tinge to them...and for the main course had a Jalapeno burger - the meat was perfectly char grilled and burger was good though bit crumby from the top but like always I remove the soggy part the one that has extra cheese and sauce and have my patty with the top part because it is always crispier so ended up enjoying my burger a lot! The mint lemonade was little over sweet but perfect, perhaps that is how it should be if not specified otherwise! My son would be a regular there because he is a huge burger fan!! The best part about the place is its location though its part of the mall and yet its away from the madding crowd..so one does not feel that he is sitting in a mall with crowd staring at you from everywhere!! All in all a very good experience!!\n***********************************************************","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T16:27:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-14T10:19:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"711705428","name":"Basit Nasir Ahmed"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"643423090","name":"Junaid Zuberi"},{"id":"592813967","name":"Umme Hamdani"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcwMTAwMTk4","before":"MTAwMDAyOTY3NTA0MTU5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397349016982921","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Luciferz Angel Ambareen Khan Nezihe Hussain Adnaan Chaudhary Hussain Tariq Shaikh Fawad Najam Quddusi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T16:31:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14},{"id":"676177213","name":"Ambareen Khan","type":"user","offset":15,"length":13},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain","type":"user","offset":29,"length":14},{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","type":"user","offset":44,"length":16},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq","type":"user","offset":61,"length":13},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi","type":"user","offset":88,"length":13}]},{"id":"397349063649583","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"thanks","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T16:31:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"397352813649208","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Raheel.

Caesar Salad at Pompei is a must. I dont think any caesar salad comes close to it. Clean chilled and crisp iceberg lettuce with finest shaved Parmesan and amazing dressing!! i always have my dressing on the side and salad must with grilled chicken as that makes it my meal!! :) I hate warm soggy salad leaves in any salad. Salad should be chilled and crispy!  Another one i really like is from Okra. Rocket salad with Feta Cheese, lots of Sun Dried Tomatoes, Green and Black Olives and Iceberg lettuce with Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar as dressing!
