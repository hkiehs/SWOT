Wasn't a fan of the restaurant floor's ambiance but the cigar lounge in the basement is amazing with beautiful pictures on the walls, giant vintage armchairs and coffee tables, flashy Ducati bikes and what not.\nCalamari rings for appetizer were great with 2 dips that really went well.\nWas kind of disappointed with the Main Course. My friend and myself ordered chicken items from the menu and it was kind of bland. Took loads of tabasco sauce and salt to make it better. The margarita was done well though.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-10T03:34:50+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-10T03:34:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"515216311","name":"Ammar Ather"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE1MjE2MzEx","before":"NTE1MjE2MzEx"}}},"restaurantName":"Genova"},{"id":"165861103465048_422434707807685","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Folks how's Club Genova??

The exterior of the venue looks classy but that's about it i guess. Being generous i would give food hardly 6.5/10 minus desserts. There were 2 desserts, one was some trifle kinda dish that i stopped eating after tasting it. The other however was the most ridiculous item, \"cream bruelay\". Not only was it spelled wrong, it looked nothing like \"creme brulee\". It looked like some \"raita with lots of zeera\" in it. When that was pointed to the host very politely, he walked away saying that he would check into it. He never returned to our table and didn't even greet us as we left even though he was standing right there(the same person was trying to be very friendly and attentive in the beginning but couldn't take one genuine criticism which probably helped the place being made fun of). Also there were no other tables occupied but us and one other table, no wonder. Lots teenagers started popping up shortly after maghrib, for sheesha i suppose. over all 1099+tax price tag was too much for such an average experience. I wish i had gone to tired and tested neco's/hobnob/arizona/roasters or Kolachi which i am dying to go after such rave reviews.
