Everyone has a different taste but at the same time I think Sajjad has a good fan following and many loyal customers. Plus its a bigger restaurant so it can absorb more walk in customers. \nNext is food.\nYour food can be written as creatively as you want. If you want a chicken dhaka (one of their most popular dish) to be just some average chicken pakora then be it. It can at the same time be crispy fillets of breast chicken batter coated and fried to perfection, served with fries onion rings and sauces, the perfect start to your meal.\n\nIn the same way even the best of karhais for you might be a handful of botis cooked in a karhai, with tomatoes and green chillies.\nWhat I also didnt understand was the fact that following your list of complains it was written that the it was not bad. No smell in the meat and it was tender and cooked in the right way.\nSo was it good or bad ???\n\nAnyhow I wish you a speedy recovery from your medical condition and I hope you enjoy the meal.\nCheers","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-19T18:31:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606013989449755","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Razak Latif first of all Aamir Basrai is the last person to give a false account of his experience.

I am sorry but I dont agree with you on this.\nLets go step by step.\nStarting with Sajjad Restaurant taking only spill over crowd ? I think Sajjad and Kolachi both come under the same league. Everyone has a different taste but at the same time I think Sajjad has a good fan following and many loyal customers. Plus its a bigger restaurant so it can absorb more walk in customers. \nNext is food.\nYour food can be written as creatively as you want. If you want a chicken dhaka (one of their most popular dish) to be just some average chicken pakora then be it. It can at the same time be crispy fillets of breast chicken batter coated and fried to perfection, served with fries onion rings and sauces, the perfect start to your meal.\n\nIn the same way even the best of karhais for you might be a handful of botis cooked in a karhai, with tomatoes and green chillies.\nWhat I also didnt understand was the fact that following your list of complains it was written that the it was not bad. No smell in the meat and it was tender and cooked in the right way.\nSo was it good or bad ???\n\nAnyhow I wish you a speedy recovery from your medical condition and I hope you enjoy the meal.\nCheers","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-19T18:31:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606013989449755","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Razak Latif first of all Aamir Basrai is the last person to give a false account of his experience.

I had to request plates 3 separate times as none of the buffet tables had them when I arrived (Put plates at the end of your buffet tables, I shouldn't have to ask literally every single time...!!)\n\n Also plenty of dirty dishes. As previously complained ^^. around Iftar lots of things were already finished, which is understandable, the workers have to open their fast as well, but no excuse for that later in the evening ... \n\nSometimes I got lucky and got warm, fresh food (mostly from the live counters), which was definitely on par. \n\nAbout the food, it was good, the spice was on point. The mutton Karhai, mutton & chicken sajji, and the fried fish were all excellent.\n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed, and at that price point (1200) , I would have much rather visited Kolachi. I give it a 6/10, and probably wouldn't visit again for their Iftar buffet, or recommend it..\n\nMaybe they had an off-day. So take this review with a grain of salt.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-02T17:58:09+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597092197008601","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Told you Kolachi is wayyy better ..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-02T18:30:56+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597096527008168","from":{"name":"Sajid Khan","id":"723716274"},"message":"Ayesha Khan i think every one has their own taste .... day before yesterday i visted there but found no difference","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-02T18:39:21+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"597216346996186","from":{"name":"Asad Raza","id":"100000744711574"},"message":"I went yesterday as there were above 950 people invited from TCS service.

And I don't doubt that for a bit. I have been dining in some of Do Darya's best-kept secrets for many months now, and I must say it's quite an experience. This so-called food revolution happening in the area has seen many of the country?s best new restaurants sprouting like mushrooms in this scenic area. And for those of you searching for a culinary experience like no other, look no further than Sajjad restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant is renovated recently with the special addition of huts on the sea, unlike other restaurants who have the seating arrangements / tables quite off the sea area. However, the interior will remind visitors of a minimalist. The decor allows the simplistic beauty of the food to really shine, though beauty isn't the only thing bringing folks to Sajjad. The restaurant buzzed with excited energy and was comfortably full with seemingly satisfied patrons.\n\nWhen we reached there, we witnessed an unusual rush and a lot of cars parked already including rushing media vehicles and few dozens of private security vans. When inquired, it was revealed that some ministers and a lot of media, like a bee looking for a beautiful flower, were there. The restaurant's capacity is maximum 800 people and i was Gobsmacked when the person on the welcome desk told us that there are already more than 950 people there, a lot others willing to stand and few desperate to sit on the grass and pay the full amount. Early reservations always save us from embarrassment especially when one is accompanied with friends or guests. Similarly; the timely reservations made earlier on the day, we were induced to our table with a reservation platen / tablet. The placement of  our table was actually the starting of the stupendous experience we have had later last night. It felt that we were in the middle of the sea. The best part was not only the comfortable sofa and lighting but also the privacy. When we go to the other eateries located at Do Darya, the placement of tables or seating arrangement is too congested /crowded. One can easily hear what the other person is talking on the other table. Fortunately, that was not the case there. Also the lamp which lit the table was soft and did not hurt the eyes. There was a bottle of Hand Sanitizer on all the tables.  \n(Picture is attached) \n\nFOOD\nFor Iftar, nicely packed dates in a plate were served with Roohafza Sharbat in milk/water. The Rooh afza Sharbat actually brought back a lot of child hood memories and it quenched our thirst while breaking the fast. Since there was rush; as mentioned earliar and the typical buffet mentality, to fill the plates unnecessarily and the competition, look I have the most on my plate! the items for Iftar finished quickly. Lo and behold, it appeared the staff was well trained to deal with such panic stricken crowd and situations, in few seconds, another serving was brought. Believe you me, fresh and more quantity than before. I detest to mention this here but I witnessed with my own eyes that people who were there in their Chauffeur driven cars, filled another plate and called their drivers to have it. The staff still did not say anything and it seemed their smiling faces spoke a lot. Literate, Ill-literate and A-literate :)\n\nMy friends and I went for namaz and decided to take the Iftar items, if left by the mob, after namaz. To our utter surprise, the restaurant staff kept on refilling the items, fresh and sizzling hot, after namaz too unlike other restaurants where they do not refill after namaz and focus only on dinner items once the fast is over. By the way, they had Wazu place and proper arrangements for both ladies and gents for Namaz/prayers.\n\nThere were almost nineteen (not really sure and please blame my taste buds) Pakistani dishes for dinner. Starting from Sajji to Lamb ( Kuzu Tandir Aakha dumba or Grilled meat of lamb) Prawn Tempura, Fish, Live BBQ items , Live all sort of Tandoor/Naan,  Nehari, few different types of Biryanis and a touch of continental food in form of 3 to 4 chicken and beef items, Cheese Pasta, variety of Chinese and honestly there was so much, I have forgotten the names already. The taste was divine! No exaggeration but I have never tasted such delicious food in my life ever. Not to forget, all that happening where that competition going on in the crowd, who has the most food on one?s plate! :D I would rate 10 out 10 to the food.\n\nThere were different variety of salads and all the dishes had a name tag. There were a few desserts, but they finished quickly so waiting was the only option. While we were waiting, we saw Kakark Dooh Patti Chai (tea) being cooked live. What else could caffeine lovers dream of? Not to forget, very few places where Tea is part of the Buffet. We all had our tea and mean while dessert bar was set up again. My rating for dessert is 7.5 out of 10.\nThere?s no doubt at Sajjad Restaurant will quickly become the hottest reservation in town! \n\nAlbeit there were Janitors cleaning the over all restaurant then and there, one thing Sajjad Restaurant people should work on is cleanliness in the rest room. I am just not writing this here likeother  people who have bad experiences of other places and without talking to the concerned people of the restaurant, they mention it here. Actually I spoke to the restaurant staff near the wash room area and told them about it, where they told me about the huge crowd using the loo,  and the reason was valid. It was not surprising for me when they told me that they place napkins/ tissue papers time to time but there are few customers who do not hesitate to take the tissue roll /napkins, hand sanitizers and place it in their pockets or bags! After all they pay a good amount; so, without any judgement, according to them, they are entitled for the toiletries as well! :-)","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-07-20T01:25:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-20T09:21:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"535211286","name":"Abdul Aziz Anis"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"611818619","name":"Humaira Shakil"},{"id":"100001715666710","name":"Razak Latif"},{"id":"1049298397","name":"Sadiya Naveed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"100001098310753","name":"Ashfaq Parekh"},{"id":"1170084800","name":"Ammaar Ahmed"},{"id":"761278691","name":"Abdullah Soomro"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"657151302","name":"Nishat Mustafa"},{"id":"509686069","name":"Hasaan Mubasher Sheikh"},{"id":"619270706","name":"???

It was a successful event and we had a great time meeting new people :)  \n\nFirstly last night was one of the coldest nights by far and I thought we were going to turn into popsicles but thanks to the  management at Sajjad that didn't happen. It was unusually and surprisingly warm. Its covered from all sides and has fires burning at different spots which is really nice. So this answers the question for all who have been seeking a warm spot at do darya.\n\nNow to the FOOD.\nStarters: Chicken Dhakka, Hot and Sour Soup, BBQ prawns, lemon chicken and fish dhakka.\n\nMains: Afghani Boti, Chicken karhai, Shahi Handi.\n\nSTARTERS:\n? Chicken Dhakka: \n The most loved starter off all time I assume. It had been wiped clean off the dish as soon as it hit the table. Boneless chicken fried in a delicious batter served with this amazing sauce. Hands down the best dish on the menu and a must must try.\n\n?Hot & Sour Soup:\nDefiantly has room for improvement. But since we were sitting in a Pakistani themed Resturant i didn't expect a tiny Chinese man dancing out of my soup. So all good.\n\n?BBQ Prawns: \nOk i am not a seafood person at all. So according to the people who ate them they did enjoy. Its a very interesting dish. Plain simple flavours which enhanced the taste of the prawns \n\n?Lemon Chicken:\nAnother of my favorites. YUM i felt like im in chicken heaven. Crunchy chicken fried perfectly packed with that lemon zing. At the same time it didnt over power the chicken.\nI would keep going back for that.\n\n?Fish Dhaka:\nAnother one of the yummi delights. Me not being a sea food person fell for them like i slipped on a banana peel. \nMust try again. A complete winter dish\n\nMAINS:\nWe had stuffed our selfs with the starters lol\n\n?Chicken Karhai:\nJust has a taste but now i know why are they famous for it. Tasted yum.\n\n?Afghani Beef Boti:\nI can keep returning for that every single day. Soft, filled with taste, melts in the mouth. Neither to spicy neither bland just the right amount of spices.\n\n?Shahi Chicken Handi:\nA shahi handi for a shahi gathering lol. \nI love it. Boneless chicken chunks cooked in butter and topped with cheese and hints of fresh herbs. It has that yummy creamy subtle taste. Geez my mouth still waters for it. Total justice to the dish.\n\nOverall: \nGreat service.\nFood arrived hot and on time.\nAttentive staff.\nLoved the plastic covers against the wind. \n\nSpecial thankyou to all the foodies that showed up. \nHope to see u all soon.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-29T14:35:00+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-02T21:31:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"541880374","name":"Noreen Ahmed"},{"id":"100001434743152","name":"Raza Rehmani"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"100003570224157","name":"Kashif Khan"},{"id":"100001356574653","name":"Rude Plannet Kennel Rpk"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"532470690","name":"Sana Zaeem"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"887535136","name":"Jabbar Abdul"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"796000540","name":"Nisa Abdul Basit Khan"},{"id":"100001217752738","name":"MehRose Khan"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"729875068","name":"Soomro Ali"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"733018407","name":"Nabeel Kazi"},{"id":"100002943458913","name":"Aisha Wali Muhammad"},{"id":"1356485615","name":"Samrah Owais"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5MjA0NTUy","before":"MTAwMDA1NDIxODIzNTg4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_674208709296949/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzQ5MjA0NTUy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"674210079296812","from":{"name":"Zohaib Ali Memon","id":"524501080"},"message":"need to make it to one of these some day","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:38:13+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213699296450","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"So who all came?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:10+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213745963112","from":{"name":"Khozema Soni","id":"513558813"},"message":"If this event took place why was that girl siting alone ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:18+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674216695962817","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Khozema Soni well there was a bit of miscommunication.

And that's the only thing that was lacking in that area. \n\nThe place it self is lovely, still not yet open so parts were being worked on. RED was the predominant color, in fact I don't think there was any other colour. But the sea was lovely the wood work solid and the full moon made the ambiance gorgeous. Yes it's very red, with lights, carpet chairs all red. But what is a Chinese without the red.\n\nThe food was limited since it was just an soft launch. But was good and each item tasted different. As the weather gets cooler the soups will become more popular. One tip thu the prawn crackers didn't survive the humidity - thu were fresh when came to the table....wilted almost instantly. Soups arrived hot and each one was different from the other. The chicken corn was actually great, the seafood coriander very nice and the hot & sour. Starters had steamed wontons and prawn tempura which I was happy to see, steamed wontons/dumplings (dimsum) is a fav and thank god becoming popular here too. The rice and noodles were both well seasoned and cooked well. In fact many commented how nice the rice was on its own. Chicken Schezuan was amazing as was the beef chili dry, and honey chicken with sesame (a little too sweet for my taste) the sticky sweet fish I don't like anywhere and this was no exception thu really liked the lemon fish. \n\nAll in all a good evening spent with great friends checking out a new place. We wish them all the best and hope that the few issues they were facing will be sorted out before the hungry crowds of discerning Karachiites arrive.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-19T06:01:40+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-20T18:17:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"724148371","name":"Rabia Hai"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"514292991","name":"Marium Hosein"},{"id":"547501074","name":"Rehana Naseer"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"522977702","name":"Sheikh Hasan Rasul"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"504517271","name":"Usman Tanzeel"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"622525326","name":"Mohsin E Azam"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"511301771","name":"Eefa Khalid"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI0NDc2NzM1","before":"NTg0NjgyMjQz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_620982761286211/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTI0NDc2NzM1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"620983104619510","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"The place does have a name but its not yet put up outside.

Did not even bother checking them this time. I love my food but waiting an hour plus for being seated is a buzzkill for me, heck it's even longer then it takes me to eat sometimes. Hence Kolachi was a BIG NO... *sigh*\n\nEnded up going to Al Sajjad as it's become quite a favorite of mine during the last couple of months.\nTook hardly around 5 mins to be seated (im very picky about seating). Must say I love it better then the others, it's not too crowded (means lesser people staring at us eating while they wait :p) and iv always gotten amazing service and taste with next to no time wastage ..\n\nNow Food...\nOrdered Fish Dhaka and Chicken Dhaka, Lemon Chicken, Malai Boti, and Chicken Karhai..\nBoth Fish and Dhaka Chicken tasted amazing as ever. Crunchy on the outside and soft inside. The quantity was very generous plus the taste which made it impossible to keep my hand away hence I was quite full to attack the others.\n\nLemon chicken was creamy with a hint of lime.\n\nDid not have the stomach to try the malai boti and karhai but the family loved it, so il take their word for it. \n\nOne extra point for how carefully they pack the left over food upon request. Proper tiny boxes, was warm even when I opened it at home. \n\nYet again they have managed to make me very happy. Great food and even better service. *Double Thumbs Up*\n\nOne little advice though, I would appreciate a better choice of music in the background.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-16T19:29:28+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T09:50:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"524835210","name":"Ali Dayo"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"1385831564","name":"Mehvish Ayaz"},{"id":"100002698452985","name":"Rabia Mahmood"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"511130593","name":"Layla Rizvi"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"620585988","name":"Midhat Mirza"},{"id":"1053980754","name":"Wajeeha Amir"},{"id":"512612823","name":"Leena Faruqui"},{"id":"100000533457073","name":"Tooba Saleem Rindani"},{"id":"687185098","name":"Syed Fawad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg3MTg1MDk4","before":"MTAwMDAyNTQ4OTcxNjE3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619768214740999","from":{"name":"Syed Fawad","id":"687185098"},"message":"Yes  true I think in nearby future this strip of rest at Do darya might shutdown  down soon & I luv the view from each rest kolachi , ambalA , al sajad &many more I luv the food there , view is amazing value if money is also good","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T19:45:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619768324740988","from":{"name":"Syed Fawad","id":"687185098"},"message":"Value of money *","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T19:45:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619774244740396","from":{"name":"Zahid Ali Shahid","id":"2531013"},"message":"Ur like obsessed with Sajjad, lol.

All were cooked to perfection except the Nachos. Nachos were stale doritios with bit of slice cheese over them. So food gets a rating of 9 out of 10.

I am sorry but I dont agree with you on this.\nLets go step by step.\nStarting with Sajjad Restaurant taking only spill over crowd ? I think Sajjad and Kolachi both come under the same league. Everyone has a different taste but at the same time I think Sajjad has a good fan following and many loyal customers. Plus its a bigger restaurant so it can absorb more walk in customers. \nNext is food.\nYour food can be written as creatively as you want. If you want a chicken dhaka (one of their most popular dish) to be just some average chicken pakora then be it. It can at the same time be crispy fillets of breast chicken batter coated and fried to perfection, served with fries onion rings and sauces, the perfect start to your meal.\n\nIn the same way even the best of karhais for you might be a handful of botis cooked in a karhai, with tomatoes and green chillies.\nWhat I also didnt understand was the fact that following your list of complains it was written that the it was not bad. No smell in the meat and it was tender and cooked in the right way.\nSo was it good or bad ???\n\nAnyhow I wish you a speedy recovery from your medical condition and I hope you enjoy the meal.\nCheers","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-19T18:31:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606013989449755","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Razak Latif first of all Aamir Basrai is the last person to give a false account of his experience.

I had to request plates 3 separate times as none of the buffet tables had them when I arrived (Put plates at the end of your buffet tables, I shouldn't have to ask literally every single time...!!)\n\n Also plenty of dirty dishes. As previously complained ^^. around Iftar lots of things were already finished, which is understandable, the workers have to open their fast as well, but no excuse for that later in the evening ... \n\nSometimes I got lucky and got warm, fresh food (mostly from the live counters), which was definitely on par. \n\nAbout the food, it was good, the spice was on point. The mutton Karhai, mutton & chicken sajji, and the fried fish were all excellent.\n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed, and at that price point (1200) , I would have much rather visited Kolachi. I give it a 6/10, and probably wouldn't visit again for their Iftar buffet, or recommend it..\n\nMaybe they had an off-day. So take this review with a grain of salt.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-02T17:58:09+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597092197008601","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Told you Kolachi is wayyy better ..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-02T18:30:56+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597096527008168","from":{"name":"Sajid Khan","id":"723716274"},"message":"Ayesha Khan i think every one has their own taste .... day before yesterday i visted there but found no difference","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-02T18:39:21+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"597216346996186","from":{"name":"Asad Raza","id":"100000744711574"},"message":"I went yesterday as there were above 950 people invited from TCS service.

We reached there around 2:30 and the place had quite a lot of people sitting. The ambiance at all the places on the strip is to die for esp at this hour. Anyways Ordered a Mushroom steak, friend ordered Kabuli pulao and malai boti, and vanilla and pistachio ice cream for dessert. \n\nThe Mushroom Steak: I initially wanted to order chicken tarragon but they DONOT have that on their menu so had to resort to a mushroom one. The steak was cooked to perfection just as I like it, the sauce also tasted good. They could have improved the presentation a bit, but taste made up for it.\n\nThe Kabuli pulao: Tasted amazing. Didn't try much of it though. \n\nMalai boti: was really good and soft. \n\nIce creams were similar to the ones I had at Peshawari Ice cream so if that's what you are looking you will like them.\n\nOver all: service was excellent. Very cooperative staff. Satisfying portions. They can try and improve their presentation, but what lacked there was made up by taste and ambiance. Would highly recommend for bar b q and desi items during sehri rather then steaks. Very happy with my experience. Will defiantly go again before Ramadan ends.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-07-19T23:31:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-20T10:05:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"688800233","name":"Arhama Kamal"},{"id":"100002756090051","name":"Niha Jawaid"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"1311140673","name":"Yumna Salvatore"},{"id":"735591219","name":"Ch Arslan Khalid"},{"id":"100005306882506","name":"Anisa Ahmed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"1586595597","name":"Khurram Iqbal"},{"id":"1368416951","name":"Muhammad Jamal"},{"id":"571357266","name":"Khurram Zameer"},{"id":"100000579235439","name":"Halima Mobin"},{"id":"1429600174","name":"Shumail Ahmad"},{"id":"100001715666710","name":"Razak Latif"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"551353703","name":"Jahanzeb Zuberi"},{"id":"649049339","name":"Basit Saeed"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100005736485212","name":"AK Pasha"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"286700230","name":"Umair Shafi Afzal"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100006124596459","name":"Falak Saleem"},{"id":"1361427391","name":"Rehman Baloch"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM2MTQyNzM5MQ\u003d\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_588678361183318/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTM2MTQyNzM5MQ%3D%3D"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"588679791183175","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Was a pretty good experience overall.

And I don't doubt that for a bit. I have been dining in some of Do Darya's best-kept secrets for many months now, and I must say it's quite an experience. This so-called food revolution happening in the area has seen many of the country?s best new restaurants sprouting like mushrooms in this scenic area. And for those of you searching for a culinary experience like no other, look no further than Sajjad restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant is renovated recently with the special addition of huts on the sea, unlike other restaurants who have the seating arrangements / tables quite off the sea area. However, the interior will remind visitors of a minimalist. The decor allows the simplistic beauty of the food to really shine, though beauty isn't the only thing bringing folks to Sajjad. The restaurant buzzed with excited energy and was comfortably full with seemingly satisfied patrons.\n\nWhen we reached there, we witnessed an unusual rush and a lot of cars parked already including rushing media vehicles and few dozens of private security vans. When inquired, it was revealed that some ministers and a lot of media, like a bee looking for a beautiful flower, were there. The restaurant's capacity is maximum 800 people and i was Gobsmacked when the person on the welcome desk told us that there are already more than 950 people there, a lot others willing to stand and few desperate to sit on the grass and pay the full amount. Early reservations always save us from embarrassment especially when one is accompanied with friends or guests. Similarly; the timely reservations made earlier on the day, we were induced to our table with a reservation platen / tablet. The placement of  our table was actually the starting of the stupendous experience we have had later last night. It felt that we were in the middle of the sea. The best part was not only the comfortable sofa and lighting but also the privacy. When we go to the other eateries located at Do Darya, the placement of tables or seating arrangement is too congested /crowded. One can easily hear what the other person is talking on the other table. Fortunately, that was not the case there. Also the lamp which lit the table was soft and did not hurt the eyes. There was a bottle of Hand Sanitizer on all the tables.  \n(Picture is attached) \n\nFOOD\nFor Iftar, nicely packed dates in a plate were served with Roohafza Sharbat in milk/water. The Rooh afza Sharbat actually brought back a lot of child hood memories and it quenched our thirst while breaking the fast. Since there was rush; as mentioned earliar and the typical buffet mentality, to fill the plates unnecessarily and the competition, look I have the most on my plate! the items for Iftar finished quickly. Lo and behold, it appeared the staff was well trained to deal with such panic stricken crowd and situations, in few seconds, another serving was brought. Believe you me, fresh and more quantity than before. I detest to mention this here but I witnessed with my own eyes that people who were there in their Chauffeur driven cars, filled another plate and called their drivers to have it. The staff still did not say anything and it seemed their smiling faces spoke a lot. Literate, Ill-literate and A-literate :)\n\nMy friends and I went for namaz and decided to take the Iftar items, if left by the mob, after namaz. To our utter surprise, the restaurant staff kept on refilling the items, fresh and sizzling hot, after namaz too unlike other restaurants where they do not refill after namaz and focus only on dinner items once the fast is over. By the way, they had Wazu place and proper arrangements for both ladies and gents for Namaz/prayers.\n\nThere were almost nineteen (not really sure and please blame my taste buds) Pakistani dishes for dinner. Starting from Sajji to Lamb ( Kuzu Tandir Aakha dumba or Grilled meat of lamb) Prawn Tempura, Fish, Live BBQ items , Live all sort of Tandoor/Naan,  Nehari, few different types of Biryanis and a touch of continental food in form of 3 to 4 chicken and beef items, Cheese Pasta, variety of Chinese and honestly there was so much, I have forgotten the names already. The taste was divine! No exaggeration but I have never tasted such delicious food in my life ever. Not to forget, all that happening where that competition going on in the crowd, who has the most food on one?s plate! :D I would rate 10 out 10 to the food.\n\nThere were different variety of salads and all the dishes had a name tag. There were a few desserts, but they finished quickly so waiting was the only option. While we were waiting, we saw Kakark Dooh Patti Chai (tea) being cooked live. What else could caffeine lovers dream of? Not to forget, very few places where Tea is part of the Buffet. We all had our tea and mean while dessert bar was set up again. My rating for dessert is 7.5 out of 10.\nThere?s no doubt at Sajjad Restaurant will quickly become the hottest reservation in town! \n\nAlbeit there were Janitors cleaning the over all restaurant then and there, one thing Sajjad Restaurant people should work on is cleanliness in the rest room. I am just not writing this here likeother  people who have bad experiences of other places and without talking to the concerned people of the restaurant, they mention it here. Actually I spoke to the restaurant staff near the wash room area and told them about it, where they told me about the huge crowd using the loo,  and the reason was valid. It was not surprising for me when they told me that they place napkins/ tissue papers time to time but there are few customers who do not hesitate to take the tissue roll /napkins, hand sanitizers and place it in their pockets or bags! After all they pay a good amount; so, without any judgement, according to them, they are entitled for the toiletries as well! :-)","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-07-20T01:25:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-20T09:21:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"535211286","name":"Abdul Aziz Anis"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"611818619","name":"Humaira Shakil"},{"id":"100001715666710","name":"Razak Latif"},{"id":"1049298397","name":"Sadiya Naveed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"100001098310753","name":"Ashfaq Parekh"},{"id":"1170084800","name":"Ammaar Ahmed"},{"id":"761278691","name":"Abdullah Soomro"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"657151302","name":"Nishat Mustafa"},{"id":"509686069","name":"Hasaan Mubasher Sheikh"},{"id":"619270706","name":"???

It?s next to the relatively famous Sajjad restaurant. My friends and I go here because its far less crowded and the food is 10 times better. \nThe karahi is perfectly done every single time, with the right amount of spices and seasonings and perfectly cooked with a nice smoky flavour. \nBut the pi?ce de r?sistance of the meal is the paratha. Made in a brick oven/tandoor, its are like a cross between a naan and parton wala paratha. It has a nice roghani taste to it, with minimum amount of oil... but the way its made, with all the parats, just melting in the mouth and forming the perfect combination with the smoky taste of the handi. To die for, I tell you!\nYou can enjoy this with not just the karahi or other items on the main course like daal etc, but this paratha is simply divine with the yogurt raita they serve as well as light salted butter and the paratha. *slurp*\n\nIf any of you are willing to brave that part of town, do go to Al-Sami for a delightful meal, which is perfect yet light on the pocket.\n\nOh and this paratha goes perfectly with the delicious doodh patti chai that you can have after your meal.

No need for details here, but the taste was definitely not upto the mark. so much so that we actually called the manager and asked him if the head chef has been replaced or something else which is going wrong today!\nTo make matters worse, the mocktails we ordered were tasteless, and had to be returned for betterment. Of the lot, Pina Colada never came back!\nI would have probably ignored the piece of hair i got in the salad had ONE MORE not been found in another dish. Now this is definitely not on!\nThe good thing was that when we brought all this to the notice of the manager, he was concerned and offered us complimentary dessert. Decent of him.\nAm i going back.

Will I wait for 1.5 hours for a meal, I realised having been to half a doz new restaurants on that strip that new places need time to get their act together. Al-Habib opened four months ago and still to improve their service and quality. Orders mixed up and inordinate delays in service are common. As compared to that Sajjad has consistency in quality of food but they too take a life time to serve their food  and need to improve on that, seems they have a shortage of staff or the line supervisors are not managing them properly.As compared to that Kababeesh's food and quality was prompt and attentive and the staff was trained to respond to their customer needs, but because it is at the end, it is not getting the attention it deserves.Ambala was another place which is quite good but needs to improve their service as the staff is uncontrolled and needs to be reminded that as a customer I demand good service quality. I have not heard any review on olive tree, some on Charcoal grill, but just that the food is average and ambiance is good.
