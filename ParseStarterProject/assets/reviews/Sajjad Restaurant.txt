Everyone has a different taste but at the same time I think Sajjad has a good fan following and many loyal customers. Plus its a bigger restaurant so it can absorb more walk in customers. \nNext is food.\nYour food can be written as creatively as you want. If you want a chicken dhaka (one of their most popular dish) to be just some average chicken pakora then be it. It can at the same time be crispy fillets of breast chicken batter coated and fried to perfection, served with fries onion rings and sauces, the perfect start to your meal.\n\nIn the same way even the best of karhais for you might be a handful of botis cooked in a karhai, with tomatoes and green chillies.\nWhat I also didnt understand was the fact that following your list of complains it was written that the it was not bad. No smell in the meat and it was tender and cooked in the right way.\nSo was it good or bad ???\n\nAnyhow I wish you a speedy recovery from your medical condition and I hope you enjoy the meal.\nCheers","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-19T18:31:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606013989449755","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Razak Latif first of all Aamir Basrai is the last person to give a false account of his experience.

I am sorry but I dont agree with you on this.\nLets go step by step.\nStarting with Sajjad Restaurant taking only spill over crowd ? I think Sajjad and Kolachi both come under the same league. Everyone has a different taste but at the same time I think Sajjad has a good fan following and many loyal customers. Plus its a bigger restaurant so it can absorb more walk in customers. \nNext is food.\nYour food can be written as creatively as you want. If you want a chicken dhaka (one of their most popular dish) to be just some average chicken pakora then be it. It can at the same time be crispy fillets of breast chicken batter coated and fried to perfection, served with fries onion rings and sauces, the perfect start to your meal.\n\nIn the same way even the best of karhais for you might be a handful of botis cooked in a karhai, with tomatoes and green chillies.\nWhat I also didnt understand was the fact that following your list of complains it was written that the it was not bad. No smell in the meat and it was tender and cooked in the right way.\nSo was it good or bad ???\n\nAnyhow I wish you a speedy recovery from your medical condition and I hope you enjoy the meal.\nCheers","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-19T18:31:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606013989449755","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Razak Latif first of all Aamir Basrai is the last person to give a false account of his experience.

I had to request plates 3 separate times as none of the buffet tables had them when I arrived (Put plates at the end of your buffet tables, I shouldn't have to ask literally every single time...!!)\n\n Also plenty of dirty dishes. As previously complained ^^. around Iftar lots of things were already finished, which is understandable, the workers have to open their fast as well, but no excuse for that later in the evening ... \n\nSometimes I got lucky and got warm, fresh food (mostly from the live counters), which was definitely on par. \n\nAbout the food, it was good, the spice was on point. The mutton Karhai, mutton & chicken sajji, and the fried fish were all excellent.\n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed, and at that price point (1200) , I would have much rather visited Kolachi. I give it a 6/10, and probably wouldn't visit again for their Iftar buffet, or recommend it..\n\nMaybe they had an off-day. So take this review with a grain of salt.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-02T17:58:09+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597092197008601","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Told you Kolachi is wayyy better ..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-02T18:30:56+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597096527008168","from":{"name":"Sajid Khan","id":"723716274"},"message":"Ayesha Khan i think every one has their own taste .... day before yesterday i visted there but found no difference","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-02T18:39:21+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"597216346996186","from":{"name":"Asad Raza","id":"100000744711574"},"message":"I went yesterday as there were above 950 people invited from TCS service.

And I don't doubt that for a bit. I have been dining in some of Do Darya's best-kept secrets for many months now, and I must say it's quite an experience. This so-called food revolution happening in the area has seen many of the country?s best new restaurants sprouting like mushrooms in this scenic area. And for those of you searching for a culinary experience like no other, look no further than Sajjad restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant is renovated recently with the special addition of huts on the sea, unlike other restaurants who have the seating arrangements / tables quite off the sea area. However, the interior will remind visitors of a minimalist. The decor allows the simplistic beauty of the food to really shine, though beauty isn't the only thing bringing folks to Sajjad. The restaurant buzzed with excited energy and was comfortably full with seemingly satisfied patrons.\n\nWhen we reached there, we witnessed an unusual rush and a lot of cars parked already including rushing media vehicles and few dozens of private security vans. When inquired, it was revealed that some ministers and a lot of media, like a bee looking for a beautiful flower, were there. The restaurant's capacity is maximum 800 people and i was Gobsmacked when the person on the welcome desk told us that there are already more than 950 people there, a lot others willing to stand and few desperate to sit on the grass and pay the full amount. Early reservations always save us from embarrassment especially when one is accompanied with friends or guests. Similarly; the timely reservations made earlier on the day, we were induced to our table with a reservation platen / tablet. The placement of  our table was actually the starting of the stupendous experience we have had later last night. It felt that we were in the middle of the sea. The best part was not only the comfortable sofa and lighting but also the privacy. When we go to the other eateries located at Do Darya, the placement of tables or seating arrangement is too congested /crowded. One can easily hear what the other person is talking on the other table. Fortunately, that was not the case there. Also the lamp which lit the table was soft and did not hurt the eyes. There was a bottle of Hand Sanitizer on all the tables.  \n(Picture is attached) \n\nFOOD\nFor Iftar, nicely packed dates in a plate were served with Roohafza Sharbat in milk/water. The Rooh afza Sharbat actually brought back a lot of child hood memories and it quenched our thirst while breaking the fast. Since there was rush; as mentioned earliar and the typical buffet mentality, to fill the plates unnecessarily and the competition, look I have the most on my plate! the items for Iftar finished quickly. Lo and behold, it appeared the staff was well trained to deal with such panic stricken crowd and situations, in few seconds, another serving was brought. Believe you me, fresh and more quantity than before. I detest to mention this here but I witnessed with my own eyes that people who were there in their Chauffeur driven cars, filled another plate and called their drivers to have it. The staff still did not say anything and it seemed their smiling faces spoke a lot. Literate, Ill-literate and A-literate :)\n\nMy friends and I went for namaz and decided to take the Iftar items, if left by the mob, after namaz. To our utter surprise, the restaurant staff kept on refilling the items, fresh and sizzling hot, after namaz too unlike other restaurants where they do not refill after namaz and focus only on dinner items once the fast is over. By the way, they had Wazu place and proper arrangements for both ladies and gents for Namaz/prayers.\n\nThere were almost nineteen (not really sure and please blame my taste buds) Pakistani dishes for dinner. Starting from Sajji to Lamb ( Kuzu Tandir Aakha dumba or Grilled meat of lamb) Prawn Tempura, Fish, Live BBQ items , Live all sort of Tandoor/Naan,  Nehari, few different types of Biryanis and a touch of continental food in form of 3 to 4 chicken and beef items, Cheese Pasta, variety of Chinese and honestly there was so much, I have forgotten the names already. The taste was divine! No exaggeration but I have never tasted such delicious food in my life ever. Not to forget, all that happening where that competition going on in the crowd, who has the most food on one?s plate! :D I would rate 10 out 10 to the food.\n\nThere were different variety of salads and all the dishes had a name tag. There were a few desserts, but they finished quickly so waiting was the only option. While we were waiting, we saw Kakark Dooh Patti Chai (tea) being cooked live. What else could caffeine lovers dream of? Not to forget, very few places where Tea is part of the Buffet. We all had our tea and mean while dessert bar was set up again. My rating for dessert is 7.5 out of 10.\nThere?s no doubt at Sajjad Restaurant will quickly become the hottest reservation in town! \n\nAlbeit there were Janitors cleaning the over all restaurant then and there, one thing Sajjad Restaurant people should work on is cleanliness in the rest room. I am just not writing this here likeother  people who have bad experiences of other places and without talking to the concerned people of the restaurant, they mention it here. Actually I spoke to the restaurant staff near the wash room area and told them about it, where they told me about the huge crowd using the loo,  and the reason was valid. It was not surprising for me when they told me that they place napkins/ tissue papers time to time but there are few customers who do not hesitate to take the tissue roll /napkins, hand sanitizers and place it in their pockets or bags! After all they pay a good amount; so, without any judgement, according to them, they are entitled for the toiletries as well! :-)","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-07-20T01:25:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-20T09:21:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"535211286","name":"Abdul Aziz Anis"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"611818619","name":"Humaira Shakil"},{"id":"100001715666710","name":"Razak Latif"},{"id":"1049298397","name":"Sadiya Naveed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"100001098310753","name":"Ashfaq Parekh"},{"id":"1170084800","name":"Ammaar Ahmed"},{"id":"761278691","name":"Abdullah Soomro"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"657151302","name":"Nishat Mustafa"},{"id":"509686069","name":"Hasaan Mubasher Sheikh"},{"id":"619270706","name":"???
