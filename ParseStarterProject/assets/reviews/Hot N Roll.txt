What better comfort food than rolls. I felt I could take on the carbs for today, so upgraded it to a crispy mayo chicken roll from Nawab's (Bahadurabad). Oh maaan, was it good. Crispy paratha, crispy chicken, and zingy mayo sauce. Rolls are such  guilty pleasures.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-28T17:31:28+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-28T18:47:12+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"780381887","name":"Samar Husain"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzNTIzNjMzOQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NzgwMzgxODg3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"387862894598200","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"exact location of nawab's please ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-28T17:33:13+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"387880714596418","from":{"name":"Mohammad Bin Zia","id":"1137915284"},"message":"I think the area's called Sharfabad.
