You will find a select variety of similar dishes at The Pakistani (Sherato) and Dumpukht (Marriott) albeit in a limited version. Overall, Karachi does not have too many North Indian/Mughlai food places that are abundantly found in other parts of the world, especiialy UK, Europe, North America and the Middle East. Pakistani food is more onion/tomato based that is grounded in ghee for flavor whereas a lot of North Indian cuisine is texture-based and uses rich thickeners like fresh cream, dried fruit pastes and yogurt as well as pureed forms of vegetables i.e. spinach, palak, onions are usually pureed to create a thick aromatic curry. Some of the dishes you maybe able to find at Nawab would include Chicken Makhni (Indian style), Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Kashmiri, Mutton Roganjosh, Vegetable Makhni, Palak Paneer, Palak Kadai and Dal Makhni (with red beans: rajma) to name just a few. Also, at The Pakistani you can request the chef to make a dish of your choice that's not on the menu and usually he'll fix you something custom to your taste buds (esp if it's a weekday and there aren't too many people around). I so can relate to your craving for this genre of food; too bad the options are limited in Karachi on this one.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-27T18:46:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"625216677529486","from":{"name":"Saba Noor","id":"832395133"},"message":"Thank you so much babar ...

It's the fear of getting yourself food poisoned, which brings out the taste. The Chatkharaa's and Mirchi's are no fun when you have everything prepared from mineral water and washed with clean water. Aamina Jahangir there is a place in Patel Para, Garden West. Dawn did a review and you can read it at http://www.dawn.com/2011/05/15/eating-out-street-food-at-its-best.html. I have literally grown up eating mouth watering chaat and sev puri's from there. They start around 4 and end everything by 8 or 9.

But if one wants to have it indoors then Mirchi on Badar Commercial is the best option.  If you don't mind sitting in the car or sit on the roadside tables then Cool Inn at Clifton is not a bad place.  Both Mirchi in Cool Inn use mineral water to prepare their chutneys and are hygienic. Going all the way to Garden East to Shamsu in this traffic is a bit too much for me although I still go halfway to Silver Spoon at Allama Iqbal Road every once in a while to have the Pani Puri, Dahi Puri and Kabab Rolls which is the best available in town.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-07T14:21:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjczMzUzNTgyNzE1Nzk5","before":"MjczMjk4NTQ2MDU0NjM2"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_273298232721334/comments?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMjczMzUzNTgyNzE1Nzk5"}},"restaurantName":"Gazebo"}]}
