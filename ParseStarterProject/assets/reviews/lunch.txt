Though it was more on the spicy side for me.\n\nI did not try the other one but according to another fellow swottie it was also quite good.\n\nStarters:\nFor starters we had Chicken Drumsticks, Prawn balls and Prawn Toast.\nThe starters were cold initially but after requesting them to change it we were served with fresh hot ones. \nPrawn toast was a personal favorite .\nI found the prawn balls to be quite bland.\nThey being cold ruined the taste for me a bit.\n\nMains:\nFor Mains there was\nChicken Manchurian:\nMy much raved about personal favorite. Was a Disappointment at RE. The CM lacked gravy and was quite dry and too sweet. But had generous amounts of chicken. It was more of a mashed mush rather then a saucy Manchurian.\n\nBeef in Oyester Sauce:\nDefiantly got me going back for more. Was super yum soft and moist. Bit on the oily side though.\n\nVegetable in Coconut Curry:\nTasted okayish. The veggies were cut quite large making it hard to eat.\nThe coconut curry was an interesting blend of flavors though.\n\nVegetable Chowmein:\nAgain I found it quite bland. Nothing to write about.\n\nThere was one more dish I'm forgetting.\n\nDesserts:\nThere was 5 kinds of desserts \nChocolate moose. Cheesecake \nCustard. Fruit chat. Walnut muffins.\n\nThe cheesecake was loved by everyone.\nI personally loved the chocolate moose.\n\nFRUIT CHAT on a Chinese buffet. Like seriously bhai kia chah rahay ho. Iftari thori hai :P \n\nOverall:\nHad an amazing time meeting up with the people who share the similar love for food. \nThe food was quite cold would have appreciated warmer servings.\nFor taste I would give it a 6/10\nChoice of dishes 5/10\n\nService on the other hand was exceptionally good.\nMeeting the owners themselves was quite pleasent.\nLoved our complimentey cups of greentea.\n\nPriced at 1100 per person. And promising 20+ dishes we found it quite disappointing in aspects of choice of dishes and taste.\n\nWould I go back for the buffet? NO.\nWill I go again because of their service at another time perhaps. YES.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-11T12:42:09+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-12T07:45:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"100001082786735","name":"Mahjabeen Khan"},{"id":"739935375","name":"Umer Latif"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"762775146","name":"Syed Faraz Baqar"},{"id":"524501080","name":"Zohaib Ali Memon"},{"id":"1107436825","name":"Xa?id Waqar"},{"id":"577774492","name":"Osamah Nasir"},{"id":"568861941","name":"Hassan Ahmed"},{"id":"1175769579","name":"Mohsin Mohiuddin"},{"id":"612945508","name":"Umair Shabbir"},{"id":"1282983841","name":"Hamza Kapadia"},{"id":"500786387","name":"Durand D'Silva"},{"id":"100000114960083","name":"Irfan Lala"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"100000238497030","name":"Madiiha N Narrejo"},{"id":"733018407","name":"Nabeel Kazi"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"709830622","name":"Saqib Pervez"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzI3NzkxMjA1","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc0MDgxMjMx"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_665038480213972/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzI3NzkxMjA1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"665040426880444","from":{"name":"Muhammad Abdullah","id":"1289258274"},"message":"Throughout the review your praising it but why so less score :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:47:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665041133547040","from":{"name":"Yasir Billoo","id":"807675696"},"message":"She is mainly praising it cause of the awesome company she was with :D right Ayesha :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:49:10+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha","type":"user","offset":77,"length":6}]},{"id":"665041723546981","from":{"name":"Muhammad Abdullah","id":"1289258274"},"message":"I'm sure, must have been fun.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:50:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665042180213602","from":{"name":"Mazahir Ali","id":"520175866"},"message":"Another cake in the making.... :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:51:58+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665046013546552","from":{"name":"Fareha Zarsheen","id":"612250309"},"message":"I tried red emperor just once before n didnt like it much.

We were 7 including 2 kids. Safe to say that was starvng and therefore ordered maybe too many starters and subsequently not enough main course but then there is always next time :). \n\nFor starters we ordered Prawn balls, Ginsoy Wraps and Chicken Drum Sticks along with the Thai Soup (the supersize portion they call large) and one order of sweet and sour (white). \n\nLets start with the soup... When a 5 year old drinks a soup and says Yummm... that says enough. One of the best I have had in a long time. The thai was so good that the sweet and sour infact got packed and taken home :).\n\nOf the starters the Wrap was excellent and I wish we had ordered more. The prawn balls were ok and the Chicken wings were also good. Again, if you go there and haven't tried I would recommend the Wraps.\n\nOnto the main course. The Cherry Chilli Chicken and the Spicy Garlic Chicken. I preferred the Cherry Chilli but overall great food. \n\nLet me add that the service was excellent and the staff very friendly... our server was Marison who did an excellent job. \n\nAll in all, a positive experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-27T08:18:01+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-27T10:45:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"502191902","name":"Zaigham Hidayatullah"},{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"638521516","name":"Abdul Ghaffar AG"},{"id":"511168242","name":"Akber Ali Khaliqdina"},{"id":"651674702","name":"Mohsin Baweja"},{"id":"885940595","name":"Ranjenah Bariya"},{"id":"586401160","name":"Ali Sheikh"},{"id":"505056779","name":"Adeel Humayun"},{"id":"1275940201","name":"Noman"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"688747484","name":"Uzair A Kaleem"},{"id":"732459812","name":"Asif Aslam"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"708482342","name":"Saba Basit"},{"id":"515208057","name":"Faizy Farooq"},{"id":"621305514","name":"Aniqa Imran"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjIxMzA1NTE0","before":"NzA1NTMzOTI0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"657927627591724","from":{"name":"Faizy Farooq","id":"515208057"},"message":"i can go to ginsoy again and again and again and again...................... and again.. and still not get bored of the awesome food it has to offer :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:34:56+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"657929180924902","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Great review Shujaat Alavi :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:40:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"853165219","name":"Shujaat Alavi","type":"user","offset":13,"length":13}]},{"id":"657932784257875","from":{"name":"Asim Ibrahim","id":"100004366567543"},"message":"location plz.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:54:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"657964200921400","from":{"name":"Saira Danish Ahmed","id":"1116196206"},"message":"I have been to both Ginsoy main and Ginsoy extension.

I hate it when the filling is to less, I can feel the taste of bread in my mouth and I hate it when it is dripping down in every bite. \n\nHad the \"East Sider\" from LunchXpress today. \n\nFirstly the Garlic Foccacia Bread is to die for. Two thumbs up for the bread. Upon first sight, I thought, \"Hmm, the filling looks less\" BUT the first bite was all it took to change my opinion. I don't know what it was but it felt like the filling was marinated on the bread, it was THAT perfect. Just the right balance and the sandwich is good value for money since it fills you up too.\n\nThe spread gets brownie points by the way. I could taste chicken, there were onions that did not overpower the taste at all, the greens were well balanced as well. A must-have to-go option for lunch and otherwise as well.

Its a neatly done place with a 65 seater restaurant, with 25 seats on the ground floor and 45 on the first floor. As it was a Sunday their was a long line of ppl waiting to be seated,my ordered was punched in by the Cashier himself, it was 930 pm and he stated it would be ready in 30 min, he noted my name and cell no and txted me before the appointed time, quite efficient.Had order the Chicken corn soup,Chicken Mushroom and Young corn curry,Chicken with lots of chilies and Chicken Fried Rice. The ordered was nicely packed and one could easily lift the cardboard boxes out of the bag as they had boxes, the food was piping out, the soup was fresh and tasty and quite rich. The curries had good flavor and I personally like the Chicken Mushroom and young corn more, Chicken fried rice was steamed well and had a nice aroma, quality of rice and ingredients were good. I had heard mixed reviews of Ginosoy and was apprehensive but the food is good and they have won me over hands down, also very economical, meal for 4 persons is around 2k that is 500 per head, and one can choose btwn large and single serving, to caterer to every type of preference.

Then he informed me that China Kitchen Karachi handed him over the order very late so he is on the way and will be there in 10 mins. 2:30pm called the rider to check where he was and he said 2 mins. by 2:45 I called Urbanite Pk and informed them of the situation on which I was informed that rider was on the way. 2:55pm rider finally arrives.

I would give this place 6/10. What you see is just part of that they had. The beef samosas were greasy and ok to say the least. The chicken wings were deep friend in pakora batter, the pizza and chapli kabab was OK, the pasta in white sauce wass quite nice but the sauce a little on the thin side but the sandwiches were the best. There were also potato cutlets, pakoras, beef haleem, gulab jamun, bohri friend chicken in breadcrumbs, jalebi and an assortment of other sweet items which I did not try. Price Rs.550 per head. The staff (I think they were all young Christian girls) on the other hand were very polite, friendly, courteous and attentive.

The four of us ordered Goat Cheese & Fig Pizza, Parmesan Chicken, Caesar Salad and Old School Beef Cheese Burger along with 3 Lemontas and their Chocolate Brownie with Ice cream for dessert. \nThe pizza failed to impress me. True, it was light and baked to perfection but it lacked flavor and it kinda reminded me of homemade grilled cheese sandwiches. The burger was AHHMAZING! The Caesar Salad wasn't exactly great either, I know quite a few other places serving better version of this salad. The Parmesan Chicken however was delicious! Lemontas were, as always extremely refreshing and the chocolate brownie remains one of my favorite desserts in the city..Can't get enough of it really, it's a must try. \nAlso, the place desperately needs a UPS because while we were there, the electricity went and came at least 4-5 times. I guess that can be forgiven though considering the current state of the entire city when it comes to electricity issues. \nDespite a few minor flaws, there's just something about Xander's..Its always a pleasant experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-19T19:42:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-20T11:34:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"100004312209331","name":"Safi Hasan Rizvi"},{"id":"557711846","name":"Gulnar Kabraji"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"1795675310","name":"Maha Javed Chishty"},{"id":"501478359","name":"Mohammad Mikail Soomro"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"1460213785","name":"Hareem Kh"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1291671692","name":"Shehrbano Ibrahim"},{"id":"509209694","name":"Sheheryar Khan"},{"id":"100002850760185","name":"Nayab Ali"},{"id":"100003201386322","name":"Hera Ryaz"},{"id":"511368155","name":"Anam Amin"},{"id":"100001039943363","name":"Munawar M Shahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMDM5OTQzMzYz","before":"NTU3MzIxMjM2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"573599279357893","from":{"name":"Anam Amin","id":"511368155"},"message":"I agree with \"there's just something about Xander's\" that one finds their flaws forgivable.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:00:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573603826024105","from":{"name":"Moomal Shahab Channa","id":"512199353"},"message":"Thumbs up for the parmesan chicken at xanders","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:15:30+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573609312690223","from":{"name":"Sohaib Khan","id":"686900066"},"message":"I loved their mini burgers not sure what they called.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:36:59+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573610032690151","from":{"name":"Tehmina 'Manna' Khan","id":"549225127"},"message":"Oh yea those are awesome!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:39:54+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573863509331470","from":{"name":"Sarah Qureshi","id":"1219353074"},"message":"We have had horrible experiences there.

Lil difficult to find the place as it is without any signage. Ordered Chilli Garlic Prawns, Grilled Calamari, Avacado Prawns, Smoked Salmon, Seafood Chowder, Prawn Masala from Kerala, Crab Grattin, Grilled Red Snapper with Pepperonata, Grilled Seabass and Blue Cheese Steak. Also had fresh Watermelon :) Food was very very nice and presentation was extremely good with few exceptions.....Grilled Calamari and Avacado Prawns....didn't like both. Servers were very well trained. Only other problems i noted were that since the restaurant is established in Swiss Cottages, the kitchen does not have a separate access like China Kitchen hence everything moving in/out has to pass through the service area where guests are housed and although the food quality and taste was beyond imagination...there were not many guests. I mean we were the only people there. This is probably one reason that they are closing down for lunch wef 10th June and now they will be only open for lunch on weekends. I would give food 9/10, service 8/10 and ambience 7/10. My favorites were Crab Grattin, Grilled Seabass and Grilled Red Snapper! Will sure recommend seafood lovers and I will definnitelyyyyy go again!!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-09T13:32:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-09T14:23:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"1505127873","name":"Moazzam Ahmed Amin"},{"id":"556372046","name":"Ammara Shariq"},{"id":"509568517","name":"Beenish Ehsan"},{"id":"647940246","name":"Maheen Khan Omair"},{"id":"666536302","name":"Momina Ahmad"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE2OTk1NDIx","before":"MTQ2MDIyMzIzOA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"569032789814542","from":{"name":"Haider Zaidi","id":"687255482"},"message":"Haroon Leghari","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T14:23:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100000059823691","name":"Haroon Leghari","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]},{"id":"569032853147869","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Ahmad","id":"536832784"},"message":"Good objective review.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T14:23:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTY5MDMyODUzMTQ3ODY5","before":"NTY5MDMyNzg5ODE0NTQy"}}},"restaurantName":"Lunch"},{"id":"165861103465048_568724039845417","from":{"name":"Haroon Leghari","id":"100000059823691"},"message":"In future HLS will only be open for Lunch on weekends e.g. Friday, Saturday and Sunday 12 noon until 4 p.m.  The Lounge will be open from 4 p.m. until midnight throughout the week and the normal Dinner service will be from 7.30 p.m to midnight.

Nothing too fancy, yet nothing to casual, either. Ended up at the recently opened Cilantro, a hop, skip and a jump away from Pane and Amore (Love). Although I was a bit skeptical about trying out a new place, and that too because my dad read a review in this Sunday's DAWN (I was like, Abu, really? You want to try out a new place because of a newspaper ka review? Kisi se puch toh lein!). Khair, my Abu being my Abu, insisted we go there, so with some trepidation, I did. Little did I know, that I was entering a fun, colorful little joint with one wall filled with chefs from all over the world. Is it weird I knew half of them? And if the owners of Cilantro read this, please add Marco Pierre White's picture to the wall. Blasphemous he's not there. Thank you. On to the food. It's very rare when every single person likes and enjoys what they ordered. Now, if you know me, you know I tend to never, ever remember the proper names of things eaten. So please excuse that lapse of mine. Before we got our order, we got a complimentary pizza toast type thing, which at first glance seemed dubious regarding the taste, and I was afraid the toppings would make the toast itself soggy. We were pleasantly surprised to find it was quite delicious! The flavors of the tomato base, onions and green pepper on the crispy toasted bread coated with mozzarella was a beautiful combination. I ordered the calamari and prawn soup, which is not for those who like mild, flavorful soups. This was hot, like hot and sour soup hot, and as expected, frozen seafood tends to have that halkiii si smell. I must say though, that the prawn and calamari weren't too rubbery or overcooked (Y). Next up, as appetizers, we ordered Lunch on a Stick. While it may sound interesting, to say the least, it was deeelllliiicccious! Kind of like a desified version of a corn dog, with fries covered in garlic mayo, which was again, very good. Just the right kick off garlic and a hint of sour. Lunch on a Stick was served in a fry basket, and me being easy to entertain, found the curls of carrots on top really cute, and yummy to eat. The batter-fried chicken that comprised of our appetizer had a salsa verde type filling, and the batter itself wasn't bad at all. It wasn't the tempura batter at Sakura by any stretch, mind you, but had some crunch to it. I wouldn't mind having that as a midnight snack, to tell you the truth. My sister ordered the Caesar salad, which she enjoyed as well. I asked for the grilled chicken and mushroom spaghetti, which while it lacked salt, was beautifully done. Tender pieces of chicken flavored with tarragon, and a hint of spice to cut the richness of the white cream sauce. Once again, I had my entertaining carrot curls, which might bother some, but since I like my veggies, I ate them right along with my meal. My sister ordered a club sandwich, which she and Abu shared, and it looked mighty fine. Even Abu, fussy as he is about his club sandwiches, enjoyed it immensely. My brother in-law ordered a steak, the Americano, I believe, and since he wasn't talking while eating, I'm guessing he really liked it. Oh, and did I mention it was pink in the middle? The steak, not my brother in-law. From my limited knowledge, I could tell the steak had been grilled to perfection. My mother ordered the Hannah or Hannan chicken, not too sure, and she told me the sauce was jalapeno flavored, and she really liked her dinner too. I also asked for the mint lemonade, which was a refreshing change, since most places usually use 7 Up as the basis of their lemonade, this was closer to home, made in water and strong on the mint, which is how I love it. The service was bit slow, however. But I was expecting that since it's a relatively new place and as all businesses, will settle with time. Now, considering that two people from the six of us hadn't ordered any entree, the bill was phir bhi much, much lower than expected, and with the quality of the food, ambiance, and servings, unbelievably reasonable. After that, we couldn't resist Pane and Amore's cupcakes, could we? If we hadn't been so stuffed, I would have insisted we sit there and have a cup of coffee and share cupcakes. That still didn't stop me from taking a bite (Or 2) out of my peanut butter cupcake, which was just...I mean...I have no words. And I have more cupcake for me tomorrow! Yay!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-09T19:22:33+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-10T15:59:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"684094046","name":"Faiza Hasan"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Came back at about 11:30 starving. Had a normal unda toast naashta and 4 bites of the refrigerated leftover burger from BURGER INC. have to say noot baad..seriously next time I am ordering two so I have a cold for naashta. \n\nThen the hard hard work at the clinic.....desperately needed good coffee and had a meeting so went off too LAL's \n\nMadiha Sultan Tai.....really good mug of large vanilla latte. Good beans. Tried 4 different macaroons.....pistachio, chocolate, lemon, strawberry....the experience was very nice. The macaroons themselves were perfect found the filling in each a little insipid, met MST and she said that it was no issue next time that will be corrected. First time into LAL's it's so pretty and I love some of their pastries I have already had those and didn't want to add to the calories......also had a little something waiting at home.....\n\nCame home to find that an order of brownies were waiting from Taha Zoeb....and OH MY GOD.....Perfect ones..... Haider Zaidi you need to try these to understand what I was saying and why I suggested a few tweaks. Will bring some over tomorrow Haroon Leghari.\n\nHad promised that I will Eat for a Cause.... So called GinSoy for a reservation for 2..... They were booked so called up China Kitchen instead and at 8:30 met Mahvash Siddiqi Khan there. Since just two offs and we are both adventurous we thought hmmmm lets have the duck. So with that one beef ribs ( yes I can't go there and NOT eat those) and one crispy beef.  The food as always was amazing. Loved the duck thu not the hoisin so took Ghazala Mijnhart advise and added some of the hot savoury sauces provided on the table. Had a lovely evening gossiping with MSK....don't get a chance for that too often there are always many people around. Ghazala tu is a treasure cove full of great idea and suggestions.\n\nAll in all a great day with many diverse aromas and flavours for THE SWOT to indulge in - in one day. \n\nCiao down amigos have a good and peaceful weekend.....for tomorrow is Nihari brunch at Log Inn lounge (Snaps Har, Abid Aziz Merchant - you guys game?)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-09T21:57:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-10T16:51:58+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"731377379","name":"Shahzad Pirwani"},{"id":"681799779","name":"Ratan Salem"},{"id":"723085405","name":"Taha Zoeb"},{"id":"641324643","name":"Nadia Moqeet"},{"id":"1579977743","name":"Amena Zoeb"},{"id":"505055634","name":"Umme Ifrah Arif"},{"id":"523286481","name":"Adnan J.

Jus' sayin'\n\nI've always loved desi Chinese food. I've been raised on desi Chinese food. The more sweetish side of things, with so many spices that one's left wondering whether to eat or wipe one's nose or eat one's food. But oh, so good. \n\nThus, I convinced the family to order Golden Dragon tonight, even though they were most reluctant to order from a new place. Since my father and I are both allergic to ajino moto, we requested that no ajino moto be added in our food. Stuck to the basics, since it was my first time ordering. We ordered the hot and sour soup, hot and spicy wontons, crispy beef, hot and spicy chicken, chicken in oyster sauce, and vegetable fried rice. The first thing we got to open was the wontons. All the food was steaming, amazingly hot. Since Abu was in the kitchen with me, the first thing he did was make a face and say, 'Aye hai! Steamed wontons hamaray matlab k thori hain.' I took a bite, then forced him to take a bite. When I raised my eyebrows at him in question, all he said was, 'Han, acha hai.' That's huge coming from a man who can't stand steamed wontons! The soup was a bit on the sweeter side,and had a kick to it, which wasn't quite enough to overcome the sweetness. On to the crispy beef, which wasn't very crispy, since it was delivery, of course, and a tad bit extra salty, but not bad overall. The rice wasn't under seasoned, which was good to taste, and the hot and spicy chicken was quite delicious, Again, a bit sweet since it was a red sauce, but the spice kick was enough to make up for it. The chicken in oyster sauce however, tasted suspiciously like garlic sauce, and also had the light brown color of garlic sauce. However, since it was relatively milder, my mother quite enjoyed it, since she's not a spice fan. \n\nOverall, the helpings were most generous, the food most enjoyable overall, and had the perfect desiness that makes one reminisce of the good old days. It was so good for my dad, he decided that if we ever throw a party where we want Chinese food, we'll order from GD. \n\nBy the way, this also validated to my father that my analysis of food CAN be trusted. Thank you GD, for a wonderful dine-in experience in this wonderful weather.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-04T17:56:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-05T20:31:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

The \"Gosht Nu Dhansak\" (Mutton Daal with Brown Rice) with the kachumar and two types of achaars stole the show, specially the limun aur mirch ka achaar which is made with lemon, ginger and green chillies soaked in lemon juice made me go back over 25 years when this used to be made in our house. Not a big fan of eggs but I must say both the Akoori (scrambled eggs) and Scotch Eggs, both were pretty decent. My earliest memories of Akoori dates back to over 30 years when it was served as a snack in the evenings in the lawns and tennis courts of Karachi Club. The Kolmi Na Kevab (Prawn Kebabs) was very interesting. Was so satisfied with the Dhansak that I didn't try the \"Patra Ni Machi\" (Fish in Green Chutney rolled in Banana Leaves).

Miss Farah hosts these elaborate dinners and lunches at her house. \n\nwe were recommended this place by an Aunt of ours who raved about her food and the place. The place has just two options 1500 per head set menu or 1700 the only difference between the two is the option to add seafood to the menu. \n\nwe went with the 1500 option which was to include 8 main dishes, luxurious salad, one starter guava drink, soup, water, soda drinks, tea/coffee and three different types of desserts. Sounds good doesn't it so far ?\n\nit wasn't just the menu we were impressed with it was also the ambiance which we were to be served in. Pool side for gents and hall way for ladies. \n\nBut as soon as booked and we gave our hefty advance payment things turned sour \nthe \"aunty\" farah introduced us to her manager Asma and said she will take care of you, that should have been hint for things to come.\n\nThe day of the party came and we hosts arrived early to check everything it started out smoothly all the guests were served with starter drinks ( although we had asked for the guava half were served with mix fruit drink and the other half guava ) no matter it wasn't so bad so we were good with it. Than everything came down like a house of cards the soup ( hot and sour was much better than cream of chicken but still pretty good ) and the salad bar opened service to gents first as there was only so much space to allow 30-35 people at once. the gents raved and went to the pool side we asked Asma to refill the salad and refill the soup. We were informed that there would be no refilling the salad as we only provide one serving ..... and soup was finished as it was just complimentary ( and although we had asked if she had any problem when making the booking we can count soup as one of our main dishes but were told that no i will not give any discount but this i can do)..... i was completely dumb struck and my wife knowing my anger said she will go speak to Miss Farah herself when she went to speak to her she was told very rudely that you are \" knit picking \" and your people are eating a lot. Not wanting to ruin the mood of the guests we served the ladies with half a bowl of cream of chicken soup and messy and almost empty salad ( and let me remind you this is for 1500 per head ) after a while they filled a few salad dishes the awesome coleslaw was replaced with chopped up lettuce and mayonnaise ( they made it up after alot of heated arguments ) which was just crap the tasteful salsa dipping sauce replaced with tasteless tomato sauce. anyhow we survived that we were asking Asma why isnt the water being served to the guests and by this point she was just freaking out and lashing out at us to stop saying anything to her she was like we serve guests the water after dinner ..... can you imagine. and there wasn't even mineral water bottles they were jugs of water. \n\nThe food came and i have to be honest in the whole experience food was the only bright spot in otherwise sorry of an excuse of a party hosted. Our dishes were \n1 lamb chops\n2 chicken lasania\n3 chicken manchurian\n4 Chinese fried rice\n5 Dry beef Chilli\n6 Chicken stuffed satays\n7 Chicken pepper steak\n8 Ginger Chicken\n\neach one was excellent no doubt. Once more we asked gents to take service first and by the middle of it some guests told me that the food is cold. AND THAN TO MY SURPRISE THE FIRE THAT IS SUPPOSE TO BE ON UNDERNEATH THE BUFFET DISHES WERE NOT ON AT ALL. and in my experience it is suppose to be on for at least and hour before the service they pour some water in the steel dish when putting the fire so as to steam the steel dish so when the food tray is kept on top it would keep the food steaming hot for at least another 30-40 minutes. And obviously once more the ladies were at the receiving end of it all they came for food other than the food refilled everything was ice cold and trust me when you are paying so much for a luxurious party you would get boiled up. And when tried to speak to Asma about she said \" i don't know what you are talking about this is the first time guests have complained so much \" really were the people before me just did not care for the food they ordered or how there guests were treated I highly doubt that. The women was under quiet the pressure than came the time to serve drinks there was nobody serving drinks or water all guests had to get up and take the drinks themselves in fact they were so understaffed we were serving the drinks ourselves to the ladies. The lone guy in gents filling drinks and water for 30-35 people got really pissed off and told one of our guests asking for water that if you want water go in that alley way there is a cooler and go fill it yourself. Can you imagine your guests being told like that ?? Than came the time for dessert  we ordered the following : \n\n1 chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup\n2 caramel custard\n3 Blue berry cheese cake sort of thing\n\nfirst we got all three desserts and they were lip smacking good all three of them than again by this point it was no surprise at all they had only made so much that only 15-20 gents could try these dishes let alone females. Than to add to the shock they brought store bought igloo vanilla and mango ice cream .... what kind of fools do they take us for i told Asma do you think we are stupid this is not what we ordered this is store bought and you have just bought it now. My assumption is they forgot for how many the party was for. than they also bought there left over kheer from maybe a party before. oooh and the best part is the bride for whom the party was hosted for had to wait 10 minutes for the dessert bowls to arrive to eat an igloo ice cream. She was polite enough to pretend she enjoyed it but my wife and i did not like looking at this situation after waiting for half an hour no coffee no tea and when just 30 guests left they bring out the tea and coffee with just 10 cups and saucers. let alone party of 70 they cannot even handle party of 30 i tell you. \n\nI don't know how these committee defense aunties thought this was a good place maybe they were small in numbers but apparently according to Miss Farah she has been doing this for over 2 years and hosted a maximum of 200 guests at a single given time. I highly doubt the 200 guests part. \n\nWe waited for the guests to leave in order to give her a piece of our mind there was not a sight of apology in fact the manager Asma apparently thought it was a big threat to us by telling us that her husband is a pathan as if we give a ....... Miss Farah after finding out everything told us the salad was enough for 70 .... i would like to tell her i dont give a **** what you think it wasn't enough for even 40 let alone to remind her it wasn't ala carte but a buffet. After reminding Miss Farah that asma failed to put the fire on the buffet dishes she scolded her a little and told us \" what do u want ? do u want me to apologize ? there i am sorry do u want my staff to apologize ? what are you looking for a discount ? \"\nSeriously women you embarrassed us in front of our guests our party was a total bust and this is all you could think about and not even a sincere apology.  When someone is willing to spend 1500 per head on a party they are not thinking about discounts you arrogant women. if it wasn't for my elders i wouldn't have given them a cent more than the half already paid in advance but they did not want any bad blood they simply paid around 1100 per head and left but what a disgrace. \n\nI DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE NOT EVEN FOR ONCE NO MATTER HOW SWEET THE WOMEN WAS AT THE START SHE WAS THE OPPOSITE AT THE PARTY ONCE ONLY SHE ADMITTED THE MISTAKE AND THAT AS IF WE WERE SOME BEGGARS. TRUST ME IT WAS WORST THAN DESCRIBED. IT MIGHT SEEM HARSH BUT THAT IS HOW IT WAS.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-29T09:03:28+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-31T11:35:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000879687062","name":"Ghazala Siddiqi"},{"id":"519619487","name":"Shajiaah Jafri Ahmad"},{"id":"704536123","name":"Muhammad Salman"},{"id":"717445135","name":"Rukaiya Karim"},{"id":"558346280","name":"Amber Faisal"},{"id":"698885102","name":"Aamir Ghaffar"},{"id":"1652751344","name":"Rameen Alvi"},{"id":"783100180","name":"Kumeil Hussain"},{"id":"890140023","name":"Madiha Rashid"},{"id":"689771441","name":"Riffat Fawad Bukhari"},{"id":"575820034","name":"Maheen Kamran"},{"id":"512868559","name":"Halima Sadia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEyODY4NTU5","before":"MTAwMDAwODc5Njg3MDYy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"480032612047894","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"oh my abdul shakoor.

I hardly get the opportunity to complain about the food.  Maybe once or twice but that was a long time ago.  Today however was another matter.  We were the only one's when we arrived so looked forward to total attention.  We visited for lunch at 1 p.m. and though the service was as excellent apart from the waiter not showing us the Special's board and expected us to walk around the corner to check it out.  We insisted he take the board off the hooks and bring it around to show it to us.  Not good!.  The food today left a lot to be desired. The bread basket had one type of bread a bit too dry and the other a bit too oily for my pallate.  The Herb butter was too soft and not being given a butter knife was I thought not really up to the mark.  The small vegi tit bits that are rolled out prior to the meal were just that much dryer then they should have been.   My host and myself were not very interested in a starter but decided to share the Scallops with Truffle Oil.  When it arrived it looked awful lying in the plate with such thin slices which probably amounted to one large scallop full stop.  They had a light drizzle of black pepper and did not look very appettizing!.  Then came the belch from me followed by one from my host.  It tasted vile!...we called the manager on duty and asked him to try one too..he took away the plate tried it and then returned initially to say that it tasted fine to him.  When I insisted he rethink his response as it tasted very bad he said it was probably the Truffle Oil being of very strong and pungent texture.  He brought the bottle over and let us smell it.  Yes, it was the Truffle Oil!...it was so strong it blew my nose away and my host's.  We all decided that the only way to add Truffle Oil to the Scallops would be to use just a drop rather then baste it with it.  The two don't work together for me as it stands!.  I had ordered the Red Crab with Garlic and Virgin Olive Oil.  A great dish and looked amazing!...the Red crab just looks so delicious even before you tuck in to it.  The taste was as expected wonderful but ever so slightly over cooked and wee bit dry in some parts.  The garnish was on the stingy side but was adequate because the Crab took center stage.  I noticed as the bread basket neared its end and only the dry bread was left there was no attempt to replenish it or even an offer to the effect.  The waiters were attentive and kept removing the left over crab shells and my host's prawn shells.  By the way my friend had the Spaghetti with Seafood.  He thought the spaghetti seemed a bit more soggy then normal having tried the same dish at one or two earlier occasions!.  The Prawns he said were extremely good.  Some background in the Restaurant might have also helped in the overall ambience!.  The shell crusher didn't get much of a chance to do much but the Crab drawer was a good touch and it helped a great deal in getting in to the nook and crany's of the crab shells.   Then came the dessert.  I ordered the Rasberry and my host the Lemon Sorbet.. both were excellent but little in quantity I thought....on hind sight it was good that it was not too much as it was lunch and ended a mixed bag of experiences at OKRA this lunch time.  I was looking out for Ayaz who I was sure was there when we arrived...I saw his Green BMW outside but when I asked later he had left.  So I did not get a chance to point out the issues...I am sure though the issues would prob not have occured to that degree if he were there!...so with all said and done...I think OKRA has to be the natural choice for the Foodie in Karachi if one is looking for excellent food!..and service!","type":"status","created_time":"2011-06-09T11:30:44+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-14T21:17:47+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"189732934411198","from":{"name":"Ali Sultan","id":"625641714"},"message":"i totally agree,but a aways think crabs should be eaten on a boat yaa phir with ur friends in a house where u really dont worry abt the table manners,and that rooni soon on me,as far as our good ole OKRA is concerned,am happy 9.99 out of 10","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-06-09T11:43:31+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"189736071077551","from":{"name":"Haroon Leghari","id":"100000059823691"},"message":"Ali...like I said in my piece...OKRS rarely disappoints!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-06-09T12:04:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"189736231077535","from":{"name":"Ali Sultan","id":"625641714"},"message":"am not promising as u guys are no ordinary foodies,but soon will have a crab party at my place","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-06-09T12:05:28+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"189736314410860","from":{"name":"Ali Sultan","id":"625641714"},"message":"and as far as okra is concern,i just seconding u:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-06-09T12:06:07+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"189736764410815","from":{"name":"Haroon Leghari","id":"100000059823691"},"message":"a small correction...the word ' music ' is missing in the background comments above!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-06-09T12:08:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"189736821077476","from":{"name":"Haroon Leghari","id":"100000059823691"},"message":"OKRA not OKRS","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-06-09T12:09:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"189737001077458","from":{"name":"Ali Sultan","id":"625641714"},"message":"unplugged buddy unplugged","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-06-09T12:10:03+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"189940631057095","from":{"name":"Rehan Babar","id":"558349064"},"message":"Good work Haroon - I completely agree food at OKRA is never disappointing - perhaps the reason I found the Spaghetti with Seafood a tad bit dry was because previously I had it with cherry tomatoes as opposed to only olive oil and this time while ordering I forgot to mention that.

It's gotta be one of the prettiest places to eat at in Karachi, and they have added splashes of color that made the place even more lively.\n\nOrdered 2 doodh patties and 2 house blend cinnamon elaichi chai...\nAnd one walnut chocolate chip pudding with chocolate sauce. And one banofee pie. While ordering I asked the waiter what were these served with as in ice cream or cream.....he said neither. S we asked him to bring us some scoops in a bowl. \n\nThe teas were fresh and aromatic. Thu doodh patti has to be had at a dhaaba, but this was pretty good, MSK loved the house blended. Te desserts were interesting but I found the walnut pudding a little dry on the inside. The banofee was quite authentic but a little TOO rich and dense. It was left over even with 4 people attacking it. \n\nAlong with a big bottle of mineral water and tip it was 300/- a head.\n\nThe weather is becoming totally Koel Worthy.

The mango salad looked very sad and limp and the dressing had way too much chilli in it (and I'm not one to shy away from mirchi). I feel it's imperative that the starter section be absolutely spot on because it sets the mood, so it shouldn't be something like what your ghar ka bawarchi churns out on a day he needs a dressing down. For the main course, my companion's beef tenderloin with chardonnay sauce was ok, but nothing to write home about. However, my pan-seared sea bass prawns was very good, albeit it was all sitting in a veritable lake of butter. The accompanying cajun-spiced prawns were also delicious although I honestly didn't detect anything cajun about the spices. So all in all, a very mixed experience and given the rather high prices, I was expecting a more consistent standard. I must mention the excellent service though - the waiters were attentive and very solicitous. That aspect couldn't have been better.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-17T15:27:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"413852221999267","from":{"name":"Mariam Bilgrami","id":"603490700"},"message":"Aman Virji","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-17T15:29:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"797300590","name":"Aman Virji","type":"user","offset":0,"length":10}]},{"id":"413855488665607","from":{"name":"Saira Malik","id":"1133719630"},"message":"Are the lunch deals still on at Forty4?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-17T15:40:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"413878278663328","from":{"name":"Aman Virji","id":"797300590"},"message":"Yes the lunch deals are still on at Forty4, however we will not be open for lunch during Ramadan.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-17T16:58:56+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"413878341996655","from":{"name":"Aman Virji","id":"797300590"},"message":"Naziha Syed Ali my apologies for your experience.

Golden Dragon - My new love for Thai and Chinese food. Hot favourites: American Chopsuey, Crispy Beef, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Hot and Sour Soup, Thai Soup, Thai Green Curry, Wontons, Zingers and Chicken Karhai (the last two from their Lunch Xpress section)\n\n2. Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb's warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I'm not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away.

Angel\nMaybe I am not a gastronomy connoisseur so my palate may not be as refined as few of my friends here but my verdict on \"Gun smoke\" classic burger which I tasted today courtesy AC could only be described in one word as sheer \"perfection\" on a plate with a side order of fries :), the patty tasted amazing with its balanced seasoning, wings were good but a bit tangy for my taste, the grilled prawns OMFG were just amazing even without the awesome dip as for the Mojito it was refreshing but a bit over sweet for my taste but then again establishments cater to a wider audience thus for them it will be pretty darn perfect... The best thing about Gunsmoke was even though it is located in a mall, in no way it gave one the feeling... It is an entity on its own... Overall a brilliant experience, Thank You AC :)\n\np.s: AC's burger in the french 'baguette like bun' was a totally different ball game :) would recommend it highly to people who want to be adventurous with their burgers :) (I Know I would next time that I am there)\n***********************************************************\nAmbareen Khan\nDear fellow swotties..I was on the table next to yours during the Gun Smoke food tasting today. Must say I agree in most part with your reviews. However there were some issues I pointed out. Firstly the cheese nachos were too 'processed' for my taste. They were simply spicy doritos covered in canned cheese dip and salsa. I was told that corn chips were not available locally(??) and therefore they had to stick to doritos. Secondly all of us ordered our burgers with the orginal bun which I feel does not do the juicy burger justice. Again I was told that Dawn is the only option so choice is limited. Salads, a few of them like the eggplant tomato was outstanding, wheras the pasta salad lacked oomph. However would I go again? Most certainly because I feel Gun Smoke will be ironing out minor glitches in no time and will live up to expectations set in part ,but obviously not solely,by its amazing ambience...\n***********************************************************\nAdnaan Chaudhary\nGun Smoke. Perfect wings. Grilled to perfection. The grilled prawn cocktail is divine. The burger in the french baguette bun was awesome. Head grill master personally delivered. Soup was great. Salad bar needs tweaking. Service still rough around the edges. But for day one it was miles ahead of any newbie joint. Prices equate value for money. Harris and kamran sheikh. Your Genesis is standing proud and tall. Bravissimo.\n***********************************************************\nNezihe Hussain\nWhat a day. Strike, heat, humidity all combined couldnt take away the wonderful time spent with fellow swotties....lovers of food. Many a noble bovine race sacrificed their lives for todays gastronomy of protiens.\n\nAt the SWOT Opening (soft) for GUNSMOKES latest venture at Dolmen Mall Clifton, met up to sample their menu and service.\n\nThe place has a fun feel. Perfectly chilled in this weather it was a pleasure to walk into the vibrant alive place.\n\nGun Smoke is synonymous with \"hutke\" \"something different\" and they have lived up to their promise.\n\nThe food thu limitedmin option today since it was a soft opening was really good. The burgers amazing. But i resent the favoritism being shown to lumboo when he got the french baguette bun and i got the regular soft bun.\n\nThe wings thu grilled and not crispy (as i like it) were cooked to perfection and yum. The nachos on the other had were doritos (not nice) the grilled prawns on a stick were perfection and i think even the BOTS spy got some tips.\n\nA place to head to on a hot Karachi summer or just for a bite of something yum. Guns are surely Smoking this time.\n\nWell done Kamran Sheikh and team.\n\nThank you Adnaan Chaudhary for arranging the lunch.\n***********************************************************\nShaikh Fawad\nGuess u guys heard Huh??? Yeah we went to Gun Smoke's- DollmenCity soft VIP opening courtesy AC. Felt a bit superstarish walking in as a line of envious eyes watched in jealousy? or may be in just hunger, as it was Lunch time, and the smell of a burger grill may have been more of a reason for wide&wild-open-eyes than the long list of SWOT celebrities : P.... anyWho, here are the dirty details:\nMuniza and I started w/ the soup and salad. Thought the flavors of the fresh&gr8 ingredients would have been enhanced if more seasoning was applied, but a dash of salt did the trick there:)\nNachos: I really didn?t think that classic Doritos could make such gr8 Nacho?s?talk about authentic : P ? wings were gr8 & perfectly succulent but I prefer both crispy on the outside & succulent on the LogINN,) side.\nBurger: I had the Mushroom Cheese, which was awesome!!! I could tell the cooking- time was something they take into consideration, as I had a perfectly cooked patty that was soft to bite in to : ))))))))))))))))) Muniza had the Pesto Burger & from what she told me it was also excellent :)\nI personally like thick home fries, but the perfectly crispy, skinny ones offered were piping hot, and only needed a dash of salt too make it deliciously savory.\nI thought the falsay drink was fantastic, so was the mint drink, but the former won my heart, as it wasn?t too sugary yet tasted natural and very refreshing!!!\nAll?n all, a gr8 opening!!! congrats Harris, and Kamran on yet another franchise : )\n***********************************************************\nHussain Tariq\nWent on the soft opening of Gun and Smoke on the invitation of Adnaan Chaudhary - Found the place extremely welcoming and lively!! of course had the company of amazing swotties Nezihe Hussain, Shaikh Fawad his lovely wife, Ally Aadil Bhamani Ryeaan Anwar Chaudhary Luciferz Angel and many many more... since it was a soft launch so few hiccups were expected but service was perfectly fine!! Tried a spoon full of doritos in Jalapeno dip (guess they were not served as Nachos) the dip / dressing was spicy and nice..wings were nice crispy and had amazing spicy tinge to them...and for the main course had a Jalapeno burger - the meat was perfectly char grilled and burger was good though bit crumby from the top but like always I remove the soggy part the one that has extra cheese and sauce and have my patty with the top part because it is always crispier so ended up enjoying my burger a lot! The mint lemonade was little over sweet but perfect, perhaps that is how it should be if not specified otherwise! My son would be a regular there because he is a huge burger fan!! The best part about the place is its location though its part of the mall and yet its away from the madding crowd..so one does not feel that he is sitting in a mall with crowd staring at you from everywhere!! All in all a very good experience!!\n***********************************************************","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T16:27:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-14T10:19:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"711705428","name":"Basit Nasir Ahmed"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"643423090","name":"Junaid Zuberi"},{"id":"592813967","name":"Umme Hamdani"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcwMTAwMTk4","before":"MTAwMDAyOTY3NTA0MTU5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397349016982921","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Luciferz Angel Ambareen Khan Nezihe Hussain Adnaan Chaudhary Hussain Tariq Shaikh Fawad Najam Quddusi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T16:31:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14},{"id":"676177213","name":"Ambareen Khan","type":"user","offset":15,"length":13},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain","type":"user","offset":29,"length":14},{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","type":"user","offset":44,"length":16},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq","type":"user","offset":61,"length":13},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi","type":"user","offset":88,"length":13}]},{"id":"397349063649583","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"thanks","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T16:31:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"397352813649208","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Raheel.

Went to Olivetto for lunch with all the elves and father Christmas. The kids loved the beautiful christmas tree at the entrance with all its tinsel and ornaments. The warm breadbaskets melted away in our mouths  as soon as they were placed on the table. Then came the starters: salmon with caviar and turkey something pasta. One word guys; DEVINE, just sorry i had to share it with the rest :(  \nOfcourse christmas lunch would be incomplete without turkey. Having eaten turkey many times, I know that its meat can get pretty dry. But not the case today, the turkey slices were moist and perfecto, with yum sides of veges, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and gravy. My son, the rebel, ordered the lamb and had us tukeyites all drooling over his plate as well. Each was attacking the other's plate. So much for teaching the kids etiquettes of fine dinning.  Just imagine all this with festive holiday music in the background. :) Although we were stuffed to the brim, the creme brule-vanilla, coffee and blueberry floated to our mouths with shortbread pieces of heaven. The little ones enjoyed their brownie with ice cream (thanks Afroze Khan). Oops I didn't mention the tantalizing drinks. We ordered the sikanjabeen, pina con nada, apple and orange juice and ...my son, the master orderer hit the jackpot with the passion fruit smoothie.

Everyone I went with had a problem with the portion size and some of the food tasted bland as well so we eventually left feeling unfulfilled, disgruntled and hungry.

Bland food, value for money, a little extra, small things to complete a dish and personalized service are VERY IMPORTANT to make a new joint take off.My advice to restaurant owners is don't look at reaping back what you have sown the first day the restaurant opens, give it some time, twelve to eighteen months, give it your best shot, establish yourself in the market, address customer complaints, make changes and woo customers, who may be disgruntled and not completely satisfied. We have seen so many success stories, which had quite some negative reviews early, like CBG, like Olivetto, Okra, Cafe 9, The Deli, and many others, their owners and management took pains and worked hard to redefine their image and achieve success and carve a niche for themselves. The owners and operators of Cafe 44 and Xanders need to realize that Rome was certainly not conquered in one day and customer is the King, the only way that they can achieve success is continuous evolution and improvement. We can SWOT it anytime but the owners and management should commits to fine tuning and bring themselves up to the required level. I hope this topic stands concluded from critique point of view.
