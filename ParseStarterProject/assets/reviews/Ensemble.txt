Im assuming given the fortnight of shutdown everyone did want to try it out, plus a Saturday night and lets admit it, it is a place more often than not we all do enjoy a lot. \n\nTranslation: a 20 minute wait told upfront. It was made comfortable thanks to the lovely cane sofas outside Ensemble which was well complemented by pleasant breezy weather. Courteous and apologetic at the same time for the wait, really made the difference.\n\nWaiters attended well to orders and there was no wait. The entrepreneur was actually watching everything when not going to and fro checking on all tables. We didnt realise our food was taking time. We were reminded by his presence. Honestly i guess the world must be complaining so much because every table and every waiting guest was being checked on. \n\n Food: burgers am told were lovely. I tried them once before: they were good so am sure these were great as well. to quote one of our: \"best burger!\" . I gladly savoured the fries and iceberg+arugula they opted to ditch. \nPrawn on toast: among the place' star items on the menu and surely didnt fail to deliver again. \n\nChicken satay: i love their satay usually. i may have loved it today but erm the peanut butter was not offfset but sufficient fish sauce/ salt. though have to appreciate how very creamy it was and how succulent the chicken pieces were. plus the garlic rice: lovely. not overpowering at all. ample chilli flakes but not at all spicy. \nI did send the satay back for redoing with fish sauce cuz it was too sweet but it didnt come back to my liking. honestly: i cannot complain. The place has always served good food so once, with all the rush outside, it was alright. It also is a possibility they changed the recipe to make it a bit sweet and creamier and not salty. I cannot complain. but i honestly couldnt eat it. so brought it back home to be fixed at home. \n\nCaramel frappe was a delight as always. mildly sweet with the flavour of caramel and so creamy. followed by red velvet cupcakes: mmmmmmm.\n\nthe place is always such a pleasant experience. have always loved their food and decor but the attention today and the efficiency by the staff despite all the rush added to yet another good evening.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-11T20:42:32+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-12T10:36:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"423319967719159","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"forgot to mention the other aspect of Xander's which also left a mark: beef patties and prawns on the bread were all well covering the bread, instead of the gaps. you get a good whole fill of what your ordered. so much attention to detail.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T05:37:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423376751046814","from":{"name":"Fahad Humayun","id":"756755028"},"message":"I had an awful first experience there and I had decided not to go there again...but now maybe I will :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T10:32:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423377937713362","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"have read of a lot of bad experiences at Xander's  on SWOT and honestly AlHamdOLillah we've never had one. \n\nmore importantly each time having observed Alexander stand and monitor everything and keep checks on everything, it got a bit difficult for me, personally, to believe things could have been so bad for people without having a solution to a problem. \n\ni do suggest you go. hopefully you wont have a bad experience but in case you do, do tell them team or Alexander himself if he's there. things are attended to: again: from observation of each visit we've made there","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T10:36:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDIzMzc3OTM3NzEzMzYy","before":"NDIzMzE5OTY3NzE5MTU5"}}},"restaurantName":"Ensemble"},{"id":"165861103465048_404065652977924","from":{"name":"Riffat Fawad Bukhari","id":"689771441"},"message":"Hey all swotties, need help, it my hubby birthday on 29th n I want to have all three meal outside....
