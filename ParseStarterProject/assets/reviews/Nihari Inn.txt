Originally my family and I wanted to go and have sehri at bbq tonight but there was a 20-30 minute waiting and since it was already like 3 in the am we decided against it. Ended up going to boat basin and the family members wanted to have handi/saalan type food we ended up going to Nihari Inn. I, personally was not fond of this place as is because I had gotten food poisoning the first time I ate here which was around 6 years ago. But the second experience was the cherry on top. Ordered the boneless chicken handi which tasted like chicken karahi..when we asked the waiter he said it was chicken karahi cooked in a handi.. Then we asked the manager and HE said it was infact chicken handi cooked in a karahi! Wth? Ordered the dhaaga wala kabab.. Which i didnt have because I dont like it. But according to my family it was good. Ordered plain nan and when I asked for garlic naan the manager was like we dont have that here.. Dude how hard is it to make garlic naan?? And I ordered the boneless chicken boti. The boti was ok but too spicy and there was no salad with it. The dhaga wala kabab didnt have salad either..upon enquiry we were told that the salad was infact the bowl of onions on our table and that too for both of our dishes COMBINED. When the waiter asked for drinks I ordered pepsi and he told us sorry sir pepsi thandi nahi hai but I let that go and ordered a mountain dew. Aaaaaand that wasnt cold either -_- Never going back there again!
