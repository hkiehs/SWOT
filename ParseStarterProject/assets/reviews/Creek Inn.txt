Loved the open kitchen and the fact that the chef has hired mostly all staff from Baltistan which is his hometown. He was there constantly supervising the staff! The service was excellent! I'm sure the desi food would have been much better! Will try that next time!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-04-28T20:13:33+0000","updated_time":"2012-04-30T09:04:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002971695699","name":"Syeda Tehseen Zehra Naqvi"},{"id":"1567299507","name":"Zeenat Bayat"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"501505719","name":"Shoaib Durrani"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2","before":"MTAwMDAyOTcxNjk1Njk5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"368808366503653","from":{"name":"Sana Kazmi","id":"701181"},"message":"ooh, is there any balti stuff on the menu?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-04-28T22:34:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"368853949832428","from":{"name":"Shoaib Durrani","id":"501505719"},"message":"Where is it?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-04-29T00:05:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"368938033157353","from":{"name":"Tasneem Murtazaalibhai","id":"676000707"},"message":"whts the  location","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-04-29T02:51:37+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"369087223142434","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Do darya - Corniche ahead of village Seaview.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-04-29T08:57:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"369087969809026","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Natasha Durrani: This place needs sometime to get their act together!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-04-29T08:59:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"369104909807332","from":{"name":"Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi","id":"684515056"},"message":"dont go to kolachi without a reservation! we arrived at 11.30pm last night & were told there is a waiting of 1.5 hrs!  the managers were extremely friendly and gave us a tour anyways, showed us the kitchen and the dining deck. its gorgeous! and the kitchen is open and clean. was looking forward to eating the thai red curry but wont now :( best to stick to the pakistani menu at all such places","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-04-29T09:52:32+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"369117746472715","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi:- NO WAY! Will I wait for 1.5 hours for a meal, I realised having been to half a doz new restaurants on that strip that new places need time to get their act together. Al-Habib opened four months ago and still to improve their service and quality. Orders mixed up and inordinate delays in service are common. As compared to that Sajjad has consistency in quality of food but they too take a life time to serve their food  and need to improve on that, seems they have a shortage of staff or the line supervisors are not managing them properly.As compared to that Kababeesh's food and quality was prompt and attentive and the staff was trained to respond to their customer needs, but because it is at the end, it is not getting the attention it deserves.Ambala was another place which is quite good but needs to improve their service as the staff is uncontrolled and needs to be reminded that as a customer I demand good service quality. I have not heard any review on olive tree, some on Charcoal grill, but just that the food is average and ambiance is good. Swotties let's get some more reviews on this new and emerging food street.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-04-29T10:21:37+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"369122263138930","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"Well I guess these places are just for desi food!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-04-29T10:36:43+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"369299259787897","from":{"name":"Sahar Iqbal","id":"509422944"},"message":"I have had no complaints with Ambala's food or service every time I've been there.
