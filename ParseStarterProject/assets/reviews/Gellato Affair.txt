Mc Donalds, Hardees and imported fries are industrious products and have their peculiar tastes that we are all hooked to. (I have a MD session at least once every 10 days). But the taste of a fresh burger and fries is a different ball game and can not be compared. Personal likings aside someone like you who knows his food, this is a little hard for me to digest.

Over the years, and please feel free to correct me if I am wrong, I feel that fries made fresh seem to sometimes turn out a little sweet, maybe owing to the quality of potatoes or otherwise. I have noticed this in fries made in my home also. This is, ofcourse, a personal opinion and I am sure there are many exceptions to this, such as yourself. Also, the imported fries are an indulgence for me and I quite enjoy the personal decadence. But, in all fairness, I will also add that I love good food but I can't cook / fry / boil anything myself so maybe its a technical thing. As far as any fresh food goes, nothing out of a packet or a box can compare to it so I will agree with you wholeheartedly on your view.
