I checked out the menu on Karachi Snob (as well as seeing this post) and the menu looked amazing. But then I was scared about the servings being small so opted for Roaster's on Zamzama for steak. First time I ever visited Roaster's. I heard so much about it but both my wife and me were a bit disappointed on the steak. Dry and no zest at all (she had the BBQ steak, I had the Tarragon), and way overpriced for that kind of quality. Arizona Grill steaks much better quality and better price. In the end Allah ka Shukar for the lovely night out and having a nice meal but won't ever think Roaster's again for steak (I heard their burgers better).  But I was sad that we opted out of Forty-4 last minute (its a 5-min walk from our home too and we believe in giving first patronage to people in the neighborhood :) The food looks very nice and immaculately crafted. I promise to make this up and give Forty-4 a try soon. We went to Cafe Aylanto few months ago and I think theirs was the best steak I ever had for the money.

(Note to Self: Go for the awesome fries next time)\nAll in all it was a great experience and I will highly recommend the place to people! :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-21T05:37:02+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-21T22:50:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1217006900","name":"S?dr?

The place is just off Naheed's on Shaheed-e-Millat Road, and was formerly Arizona Grill.  Met up with an old friend there, and ordered the Flamied Grill Steak.\n\nI am generally wary of ordering steaks at a place which has Arizona in its name, or which in its menu serves more than 70% of steak entrees with random sauces.  Ordered a Flamed Grill Steak, since the description didn't enlist any sauce for it, and asked for it to be Medium Rare.\n\nWhat I was served was basically 'Beef Pasanday', and there is absolutely no way the entree can be classified as a steak.  There was no need for it to be Medium Rare, because beef pasanday are just served as beef pasanday, and not Medium Rare!\n\nWhat Grill House needs to do is add a side of potatoes, and serve some hot naan with pasanday -- and accordingly change the name of 'Flamed Grill Steak' to 'Masalaydaar Pasanday'.  I am sure that Maslaydaar Pasanday can be their best selling entree, if they can serve karak naan with it, and some raaita too, of course.\n\nThe place is blasphemy to the religion of steaks, and the beef entrees are only recommended if one is looking for a filling meal of pasanday.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-11T16:47:18+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-11T20:45:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"533260601","name":"Ali Shahid"},{"id":"506634707","name":"Iqra Anwar Shah"},{"id":"654231486","name":"Sami Khan"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"1664160731","name":"Amna Abbasi"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"553350590","name":"Faizan Chaghtai"},{"id":"502158910","name":"Mujtaba Karim"},{"id":"561575202","name":"Usuf Haroon"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100000087775469","name":"Arshad Shamsi"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"569950203","name":"Anis Rajwani"},{"id":"511149199","name":"Shaherbano H.

We were 5 friends and since the place is \"known\" for its steaks we all ordered it. I ordered Arizona Fire Steak which by name seemed Arizonas specialty, when my order arrived, which was in due time and served in correct temperature, it was the opposite of what I expected. By \"fire\" I thought it would be something hot, saucy, spicy but when platter was placed in front of me I wasn't sure I was at Arizona. The presentation was zero, it looked like a piece of dry meat placed in a platter with mashed potatoes to go with it, which looked liked uncooked pizza dough, and few boiled vegetables on the other side. Too unprofessional. Anyways I started to eat still hopeful that it might not taste the way it looks, but that was disappointment too. The taste wasn't that bad but nothing extraordinary. The mashed potatoes were too salty, out of all the things on it i liked the boiled vegetables :P. Then we ordered dessert which was Chocolate Silk Pie. It arrived with same, unappetizing presentation. The taste was good but there was nothing silky! Infact the bottom layer was so hard that I might have to stand up on it to break it. \nSo my experience at Arizona was really bad. after paying such a big amount I still left with half stomach empty. The staff was good and co-operative. Good service.

I had no idea that so many outlets have opened in Karachi in recent years. This is phenomenal. Saw a post the other day by someone craving for a shararma ? well I would more than happy to barter any number / types of shararmas for Ghaffar?s fry kabab/Zameer?s malai boti and that brutally hot red tikka from boat basin!! There is a serious shortage of desi Pakistani restaurants here (four in total) and only one that serves a decent halwa puri (on a Friday and ONLY till noon, thank you very much!!). I remember this amazing bihari boti place near Bahadurabd (can?t recall the name) which in my opinion served the best bihari / paratha combination.  Also remember Zameer Ansari starting with a small stall and fanning the grills himself!! That heavenly Sushi / Teriyaki at Sakura and the steak at Arizona Grill when they started out?.Good times!!

I, along with a colleague went there for the reservations and woahh the management over there was very much concerned about the \"10% Service Charges\" as they kept on mentioning that I will have to pay 10% service charges on the bill since we are 15 people. I had no issues on service charges but did not like the way they kept on mentioning it so I had to say k \"Bhai Mil Jayein Gay Apko Don't worry\". Anyways, we went there at 6:00pm in the evening, ordered the food out of which 6 were steaks including Pepper Steak, 2 Arizona Fire Steak, Twin Steak, American something steak. Food was delivered \"Kiston Mein\" after 40 minutes. To our disappointment, all the steaks were served COLD and also they served Mexican Steak in Chicken instead of one Arizona Fire Steak. Had to return all the steaks and waited another 10 minutes for them to come back with the correct order. 4 Order were returned correctly but for the rest of 2 steaks (One of it was mine :() the waiter said that chef will have to make new steaks since they were medium rare and cant be cooked further so we will have to wait for another 20 to 25 minutes. This was the last nail in the coffin. I asked them to cancel my order and told them that you guys should not ask for service charges when you cant entertain your customers properly. You brought the food after 40 minutes, brought 1 wrong order, 6 cold steaks, made us wait further to get the food and now you are telling me that I have to wait another 20 minutes? Right after 2 minutes, waiter came back with a steak and told me that its on the house which I refused and told him that the free food tactic will not change our experience with your pathetic services. Rest of the people were done with their food by the time. Bill arrived and guess what.....THEY FELT NO SHAME IN PUTTING THE SERVICE CHARGES IN THE BILL. I have been to Zamzama's one and always appreciate their service but I must say that Atrium Mall's Arizona has shown me new horizons of pathetic services.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-07T14:57:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-08T10:40:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"672864677","name":"Aamir A.

Apart from the rude and downright stupid waiters, the food was AWFUL and took about 30 minutes to arrive - that too, it came in bits a pieces; my husband's order came first, then mine - but the order was incomplete. I had the misfortune of ordering the chimichangas which were accompanied by ranch dressing (listed as 'Sour cream' on the menu), watered down chilli garlic sauce (listed as 'salsa') and two pitas (listed as 'flour tortillas'). When we complained to the waiters and even met the so-called manager, we were annoyed at how they really couldn't care less about our opinion. We insisted on speaking with the owner, but he didn't pick up his phone until about 2 hours later. Anyway, we left our half-eaten food and walked out - right infront of the 'manager' and waiters.

Anyways, while leaving my team applaud for the entire staff to humiliate them in front of other customers :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-07T18:40:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq","type":"user","offset":15,"length":13}]},{"id":"581868048531016","from":{"name":"Bushra Farooq","id":"516582666"},"message":"I somehow don't think that would work these people have thick skins and generally nothing affects them!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-07T18:43:12+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"581868975197590","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"When ever u go without me u have a bad experience :-P I wonder y :-(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-07T18:46:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"581968231854331","from":{"name":"Abeer Merchant","id":"711296046"},"message":"Sheharyar, I went to the Zamzama one treating my mom who isn't the one to go out for dinners and was equally disappointed. I have always loved the place otherwise. But this time round was a total waste of time and money and a bitter experience. The fish we ordered was all watery and despite mentioning again and again for a well done steak, we were still served medium rare. Even the steak meat was not of good quality. It may have been due to rush hour, but then they should be well prepared for that before hand. That's what eating out is all about to begin with: good service.\nArizona was one place that had so far kept its quality and standard maintained, but I guess they have started to go down too.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-07T23:35:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"582030615181426","from":{"name":"Nilam Jamil","id":"100001562441083"},"message":"Thanks for sharing !!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-08T03:41:50+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"582126808505140","from":{"name":"Batool Aun Ali","id":"100000154775195"},"message":"I second your experience!

Situated up above Pearl Continental Hotel, the place was no less than magnificent when we walked in. The subtle ambiance, the pre-50's music playing, the extra-courteous waiters, I had a feeling it was going to be one amazing dinner. I had ordered the Chicken Dijon Steak and my friend ordered the Lobster Tail. After approximately twenty minutes of waiting, we had our food served to us. I can describe the food in one work, HORRIBLE! When a place is charging more than RS. 1000 per steak, one would obviously expect it to be amazing, but it was the worst steak I've had in the city. And don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind paying extra money if the food is worth it, sadly this wasn't even close. I would go as far as saying Arizona Grill serves better steaks than this place. It's terribly overpriced for the horrible food they serve. The portions were extra-small, and the steak tasted like something that would be made at home. I rank this high-class restaurant, not classy enough to go to. Extremely disappointed.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-16T05:35:17+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-16T16:24:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"1531865247","name":"Haris Ahsen"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"694723124","name":"Haris Shaikh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk0NzIzMTI0","before":"NTA1NTgxNTI4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"424680034249819","from":{"name":"De Joe","id":"597535350"},"message":"my question to u would b..... y go there in the first place. u want a good steak....... pompeii is a no brainer.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-16T05:38:21+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"424680237583132","from":{"name":"Ali Khan","id":"571016150"},"message":"Wanted to try something new, I love Pompeii but I go there too often.

Their desserts arent anything to write home about but their meals were pretty satisfying.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-31T05:39:55+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mjg3NDIzODgxMzA4NzY5","before":"Mjg3MTE5NDM0NjcyNTQ3"}}},"restaurantName":"Arizona Grill"},{"id":"165861103465048_270820802969077","from":{"name":"Razia Khan","id":"617612007"},"message":"Where is Raj Rasoi?","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-03T12:45:42+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-03T12:52:32+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"270821862968971","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Next to Sohny sweets at Clifton.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-03T12:47:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"270821986302292","from":{"name":"Razia Khan","id":"617612007"},"message":"Arizona Grill lane?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-03T12:48:03+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"270822649635559","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Arizona grill has shut down, raj Rasoi has opened on its place.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-03T12:49:51+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"270822969635527","from":{"name":"Razia Khan","id":"617612007"},"message":"Y did thy close Arizona Grill?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-03T12:50:51+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"270823236302167","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"so Raj Rasoi could open :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-03T12:51:40+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"270823279635496","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"I'll have to ask their management before I can reply to this one Razia.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-03T12:51:48+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"270823536302137","from":{"name":"Razia Khan","id":"617612007"},"message":"Lol...Sorry...I am a steak lover.\nThanks for the location though.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-03T12:52:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjcwODIzNTM2MzAyMTM3","before":"MjcwODIxODYyOTY4OTcx"}}},"restaurantName":"Arizona Grill"},{"id":"165861103465048_269307866453704","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Went to Bbq tonite on Saturday night, ordered Pepper Steak,Tenderloin steak, Chicken Shashlik, Shish Touk, Hummus, Palak Paneer, Rogni and Kandhari nan, also enjoyed the garlic nan served complimentary with the hummus. The steaks were massive,both my kids couldn't eat them combined and even my pepper steak was very wholesome. Vegetable rice was freshly made and excellent to taste. The pepper steak well done was just right,juicy and tender with lot of charred onions, couldn't have asked for anything else, sorry Arizona Grill nothing like a steak served sizzling on the hot plate for 550 a piece instead of your cold and drab steak, which is not worth the price.Last but not the least Kulfi was well made and served hard with savienya. East or west Bbq tonite is the best, no match for service and value for money.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-11-30T21:30:08+0000","updated_time":"2011-11-30T21:30:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4","before":"MTQ0MjI3MTY4Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"restaurantName":"Arizona Grill"}]}
