The burger which is one of the things it is known for was a huge helping and tasty to boot which made us plan another trip there on the spot! Also the french fries were crunchy and complimented the meals, the baked potato on the other hand was totally overcooked to the point of resembling a mash!

We were 5 friends and since the place is \"known\" for its steaks we all ordered it. I ordered Arizona Fire Steak which by name seemed Arizonas specialty, when my order arrived, which was in due time and served in correct temperature, it was the opposite of what I expected. By \"fire\" I thought it would be something hot, saucy, spicy but when platter was placed in front of me I wasn't sure I was at Arizona. The presentation was zero, it looked like a piece of dry meat placed in a platter with mashed potatoes to go with it, which looked liked uncooked pizza dough, and few boiled vegetables on the other side. Too unprofessional. Anyways I started to eat still hopeful that it might not taste the way it looks, but that was disappointment too. The taste wasn't that bad but nothing extraordinary. The mashed potatoes were too salty, out of all the things on it i liked the boiled vegetables :P. Then we ordered dessert which was Chocolate Silk Pie. It arrived with same, unappetizing presentation. The taste was good but there was nothing silky! Infact the bottom layer was so hard that I might have to stand up on it to break it. \nSo my experience at Arizona was really bad. after paying such a big amount I still left with half stomach empty. The staff was good and co-operative. Good service. But who goes to restaurant for the good service only?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-13T18:21:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-14T01:48:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001882596023","name":"Mansoor Zaheer"},{"id":"673197577","name":"Syed Talha Khurshid"},{"id":"559881298","name":"Nadia Mahasin"},{"id":"100001420487264","name":"Saqib M Ibrahim"},{"id":"651245042","name":"Falak Zahid Sheikha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjUxMjQ1MDQy","before":"MTAwMDAxODgyNTk2MDIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"602689159782238","from":{"name":"Faryal Naqvi","id":"739670623"},"message":"sadly arizona has really detoriated over time","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T18:25:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602691326448688","from":{"name":"Xaraa Aar Kay","id":"100001611544621"},"message":"the last time i went to Arizona.. it was Awesome!\ni went to Arizona at Atrium Mall...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T18:31:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602691796448641","from":{"name":"Sarah J.
