Really foamy and strong 10/10 to that for keeping me from freezing.\n\nNext up ordered the Chicken Corn Soup & Hot and Sour.\nI had the chicken corn which tasted amazing! \nClear to say the best soup this winter. Had loads of corn and was loaded with chunks of boneless chicken. Thick and creamy with herbs.\nWas just perfect. I will be going back for more\nSame goes for the Hot and Sour.\nPlus the bread along with the soup that needs a separate thumbs up.   \n\nTheir Grilled fish is the best iv tasted.\nPerfectly cooked and steaming hot when it arrived.\n\nThe Charcoal platter ain't short of praises either. No wonder its the most loved. Was so full that couldn't try everything on it. But my friend loved it. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted yummiliious.\n\nOverall perfect food for this amazing winter, backed up by flawless speedy service.\n\nMy new go to spot for these winters :) who says Kolachi is the best on the strip, i suppose Charcoal has the tendency to give them a run for their money very soon.

Was not expecting Karachi's weather to be this cold and windy. There was only one family before us and by the time we left only two more came. The place was largely empty. \n\nOrdered Chicken boneless karahi and spicy fish tikka along with paratha, garlic nan and roghni nan. \nThe food was superb. Karahi was better than many places I tried recently, and fish was also excellent. The prices are also reasonable, and food for 3 costed only Rs. 1,700.\n\nThey only need to improve on their service. They brought naans without a napkin and in that weather they turned cold pretty quickly. Had to ask for a napkin. They served fish and raita uncovered too. Otherwise, the staff was courteous and service quick. Overall a pretty good experience. Will definitely recommend.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-22T08:27:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-22T13:36:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"691642690","name":"Hira Tariq"},{"id":"762775146","name":"Syed Faraz Baqar"},{"id":"851800404","name":"Aamna Mansoor Badshah"},{"id":"601955407","name":"Rashid H Ansari"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"},{"id":"100001263140827","name":"Fahad Tariq Bhirya"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100006186248618","name":"Sehr Shaikh"},{"id":"1282983841","name":"Hamza Kapadia"},{"id":"100000720206680","name":"Shazia A.

In case you're wondering, I did not just go to a restaurant in Karachi. So I can't really share my experience at one of these that are discussed here.\n\nBut what i will tell you is that I have lived in Karachi for most of my life (well, until I decided to go study engineering at NUST Islamabad). Even more than the lights and the life Karachi resonates with, what I miss the most is food... OUR Food. From the \"ami kay hath ki pakai hwe bhujya\" and Bun Kabab Stalls at Tariq Road to Kolachi at the rocks, every bite has had a special taste to it- one that is simply absent from the food that I eat here.\n\nPlease don't misunderstand me. Islamabad has some amazing restaurants. Chai khaana and Kitchen Cuisine, for instance, are worth a try. But the taste, the mix, the presentation and everything else is something we Karachiites can never settle for.\n\nEveryday, I stare down at food that lacks in spices, add-on veggies, and often in cooking too. After all, the hostel dining hall has to cater to students from all over the country. From what I have inferred, the spice intake generally decreases as you go \"up\" the country.\n\n The Haleem on Saturdays is nowhere near to the one you guys can eat at Burns Road. You would not believe that what I get on Thursdays is Biryani if you've have had a plate at any of the dhabbas or even your own place. The Qorma here? Oh boy if only they would use Shaan Masalas for that.\n\nYou know, I have kind of given up on the restaurants here too (seriously, how can anyone manage to eat  Afghani Burger?) What I now look most forward to is the monthly courier parcel my mom sends me. Yesterday I opened December to find packets of shami kababs, home made spaghetti, and chicken wings ^__^\n\nKarachi is under fire. Karachi is at War. Karachi probably needs a batman . But trust me, you guys still get damn good food to eat. I lost like 6 kg in my first 3 months here. Still haven't managed to recover all of that.\n\nBe grateful for the food you eat;love Karachi for it.\n\nStay safe \u003c3","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-09T20:55:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-10T19:26:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"807153988","name":"Huma Hussan"},{"id":"698480213","name":"Faiza Shafiq"},{"id":"100002459812246","name":"Mumtaz Begum Tejani"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"537798684","name":"Abdul Basit Memon"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"697750147","name":"Mohammad Ismail Asif"},{"id":"672626621","name":"Asad Baig"},{"id":"753624574","name":"Shazmeen Raza"},{"id":"100001993284398","name":"Rumaisa Nasir"},{"id":"650649934","name":"Ashnaa F Khan"},{"id":"564445611","name":"Shahbaz Ali Shueb"},{"id":"100002861468579","name":"Javeria Talal"},{"id":"100006019808344","name":"Anum Ellahi"},{"id":"552958742","name":"Amir Arfeen"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"100001408655261","name":"Faizan Kamran"},{"id":"864385150","name":"Faiz Khalil Shaikh"},{"id":"513198695","name":"Madiha Shiekh"},{"id":"655137222","name":"Hufsa Rizwan"},{"id":"781150340","name":"Huma Baqir"},{"id":"100006538473120","name":"Ali Shujaat"},{"id":"649725153","name":"Ateeb Akber"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ5NzI1MTUz","before":"ODA3MTUzOTg4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_664275373623616/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjQ5NzI1MTUz"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"664372816947205","from":{"name":"Faiz Rahila","id":"681048718"},"message":"Very well said Hassan.

Kolachi has really awesome food and is THE restaurant experience in the Phase 8 strip, if not the whole of Karachi itself. I love the new first-come-first-serve system, now we don?t have to go back disappointed learning the whole place is booked. After waiting a mere 5 minutes for our table we got a nice table on the deck. We ordered Lahori Fish as starters and although I am not a seafood fan but those finger fish are something special. They were tangy, slightly crispy and the sauce given with them complimented the dish excellently. For the main course we ordered the Kolachi Special Steak (Chicken), Paneer Reshmi and Chicken Turkey sandwich. The Kolachi Special Steak in beef is my humble opinion the best steak available in Karachi and the chicken one has come to par with it. The Paneer Reshmi with garlic and roghni naan was a delight as ever, however for our own guilty indulgence we also had it with paratha. The Chicken Turkey sandwich was a light yet fulfilling meal and tasted as a sandwich, I?m glad they don?t overdo it or give a small sampling, they just provide with what is expected in a good sandwich. I ordered the blue margarita drink which I enjoyed with my steak. My diet conscious friends had lemongrass tea after the meal and according to them it helped settle down the food, however my greedy tastebuds would only go for a sweet dessert after a good meal. We ordered Zafran and Pista Kulfi and again, Kolachi did not disappoint by giving an authentic taste yet a familiar feeling to the food that just makes you fell in love with it. You guys must have guessed that we are fans of Kolachi (like so many other people who have no complains with the place). The service is great, friendly and cooperative and seeing the ambience and quality, the price is very economical.

(My dad is an ultimate nakhray wale uncle:p like the one who calls a steak gosht ka tukda, a pizza 'roti utay boti' and so on) so I always opt for desi with dad since he tends to be very particular with expense directly proportional to taste! Went for an early dinner to Khanji and were seated immediately (1. the weather was lovely, I loved how I ate desi with those back support chairs I could sink into after a long tedious day). Moving to the menu, really extensive, efficiently put together... Ordered Mutton Peshaweri Karhai, Shish Taouk...on asking about the serving we were told there would be 6 pieces so we order yet another 2 items (we dint know they wudnt be tiny pieces, instead king kong pieces) ordered fish tikka and Namkeen Boti. Dad was disappointed for no tandoori roti and only having chapati as an option! Waiter immediately said they can get from another eatery and so we ordered both\nPumpkin Meetha(I don't eat pumpkins, cant say much :))\nThe POST MORTEM:\nMutton Peshaweri Karhai: Nothing like those al habib or Kolachi tastes! Distinct flavors, loved how tender the meat was (I do not eat mutton apart from home but i surprisingly did!). Maybe the right tinge of Peshawer 10/10\n\nNamkeem Boti: I thought they'd be somehow salty (Namkeem wohi hota hai na?) But I think well marinated Chicken with an unbelievably managed execution, 10/10\n\nShish Taouk: A different version of Malai Boti, perhaps with some arabic spices maybe? (y m i being a chef? lol I'd rate it 8/10)\n\nFarmaishi Chapatti : Loved it, literally chapati had some peshaweri khan baba ki rooh in it maybe?

However we never realized that its going be this bad! Firstly, after constant requests, the waiter did not bother bringing us a menu. The waiter ended up coming after 20 minutes to take the order, and I thought that it was now time to relax! Well I was wrong to say the least, firstly, the music that was being played, gave me a headache! Nickelback playing in full volume is not something I expected to bear when I came to have a nice dinner with a relaxing cup of coffee. After at-least 45 minutes of waiting and begging for the food to arrive, my friend decided it was time to go and ask the manager what the scene was. \n\nThe reply which we got is as follows: ?You will have to be patient, it?s a full house today, there is nothing I can do? \n\nWell the food finally came, and the guy forgot one dish! Here are my reviews to each dish:\nPizza ? Extremely bland. Not well cooked or maybe lacked the ingredients. I?m no expert cook, so I don?t know the technicalities, but all I know is that it sucked and I would never want to have it again! The frozen food which I usually end up heating in the microwave for a midnight snack is better than this!\n\nThe Besharam burger -  Maybe a bad choice on my part, I don?t like burgers with sunny side up. But even after removing the egg, it tasted ?Average? ? No taste, nothing. Burger shack is a better place to have burgers not to forget MC DONALDS!\n\nBaragosht Roast burger ? Once again, extremely disappointed. The burger was meant to be roasted. NOT TOASTED! It was a pity that it tasted so awful.\nSome rice dish (can?t recall the name) ? best of the lot. Tasted far far better than other dishes and was worth the money.\n\nSheesha ? Rs. 900+ tax. I don?t care if you fill the sheesha up with real fruits instead of flavor, it doesn?t get this expensive! And on top of that, anyone who sits outside HAS to order sheesha is their policy. But I?m not going to take credit away from you guys, the sheesha was good. But not worth the money.\n\nIn the end, I would just like to tell my fellow members here. Please think twice before you goto this caf?. Just because you think it?s a nice name and closest thing we have to starbucks. It is not an excuse to go waste Rs. 1,000 +/head on bad food. \n\nMoreover, a message to Sattarbuksh owners. \nSaying that this was a soft launch doesn?t cut it. Your service sucked and so did the food. If you cannot take so many people, then consider hiding a few chairs and tell people to stand and wait till anyone leaves so that you don?t end up serving bad food. Places like Kolachi, Aylanto etc.. have huge waitings at times and are jam packed.

The quantity was very generous plus the taste which made it impossible to keep my hand away hence I was quite full to attack the others.\n\nLemon chicken was creamy with a hint of lime.\n\nDid not have the stomach to try the malai boti and karhai but the family loved it, so il take their word for it. \n\nOne extra point for how carefully they pack the left over food upon request. Proper tiny boxes, was warm even when I opened it at home. \n\nYet again they have managed to make me very happy. Great food and even better service. *Double Thumbs Up*\n\nOne little advice though, I would appreciate a better choice of music in the background.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-16T19:29:28+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T09:50:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"524835210","name":"Ali Dayo"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"1385831564","name":"Mehvish Ayaz"},{"id":"100002698452985","name":"Rabia Mahmood"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"511130593","name":"Layla Rizvi"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"620585988","name":"Midhat Mirza"},{"id":"1053980754","name":"Wajeeha Amir"},{"id":"512612823","name":"Leena Faruqui"},{"id":"100000533457073","name":"Tooba Saleem Rindani"},{"id":"687185098","name":"Syed Fawad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg3MTg1MDk4","before":"MTAwMDAyNTQ4OTcxNjE3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619768214740999","from":{"name":"Syed Fawad","id":"687185098"},"message":"Yes  true I think in nearby future this strip of rest at Do darya might shutdown  down soon & I luv the view from each rest kolachi , ambalA , al sajad &many more I luv the food there , view is amazing value if money is also good","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T19:45:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619768324740988","from":{"name":"Syed Fawad","id":"687185098"},"message":"Value of money *","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T19:45:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619774244740396","from":{"name":"Zahid Ali Shahid","id":"2531013"},"message":"Ur like obsessed with Sajjad, lol.

The place is just off Naheed's on Shaheed-e-Millat Road, and was formerly Arizona Grill.  Met up with an old friend there, and ordered the Flamied Grill Steak.\n\nI am generally wary of ordering steaks at a place which has Arizona in its name, or which in its menu serves more than 70% of steak entrees with random sauces.  Ordered a Flamed Grill Steak, since the description didn't enlist any sauce for it, and asked for it to be Medium Rare.\n\nWhat I was served was basically 'Beef Pasanday', and there is absolutely no way the entree can be classified as a steak.  There was no need for it to be Medium Rare, because beef pasanday are just served as beef pasanday, and not Medium Rare!\n\nWhat Grill House needs to do is add a side of potatoes, and serve some hot naan with pasanday -- and accordingly change the name of 'Flamed Grill Steak' to 'Masalaydaar Pasanday'.  I am sure that Maslaydaar Pasanday can be their best selling entree, if they can serve karak naan with it, and some raaita too, of course.\n\nThe place is blasphemy to the religion of steaks, and the beef entrees are only recommended if one is looking for a filling meal of pasanday.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-11T16:47:18+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-11T20:45:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"533260601","name":"Ali Shahid"},{"id":"506634707","name":"Iqra Anwar Shah"},{"id":"654231486","name":"Sami Khan"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"1664160731","name":"Amna Abbasi"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"553350590","name":"Faizan Chaghtai"},{"id":"502158910","name":"Mujtaba Karim"},{"id":"561575202","name":"Usuf Haroon"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100000087775469","name":"Arshad Shamsi"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"569950203","name":"Anis Rajwani"},{"id":"511149199","name":"Shaherbano H.

night...luckilly we had a reservation - it was Monday night and it was packed and people were actually waiting for their tables and were actually smiling...food wise it was ok..have had better meals at Kolachi...hummus was very good, kababs were average and chargha was strictly ok, they should change the recipe..it was sweet and sour chargha...never had this flavor in chargha ever..and kardhai was as usual superb..did not order much because our guests were totally chicken fans..so seafood and mutton was not ordered...coming on to service...have not seen this standard anywhere in Pakistan there are few fine dines who claim to be the best when it comes to customer handling...they should come and get training at Kolachi...the standards of service are unmatched...excelence in service should be retitled kolachi...  \n\nJust now had snog at Dolmen..the bestest yoghurt...right texture and right flavours..have not tried the new ones but amongst the oldies Snog is the best...

But the person who took my call offered to keep the place open and reserve me a table which is by far sweetest thing ever.\n\nUpon reaching, there was already someone waiting at the door for me. I was seated at their best spot. Now for the order. Well since I already had dinner so didn't.order something heavy just their lemon chicken and Dhakka Chicken. \nTo be honest I was expecting below average food as I had invaded them after they had already closed. But NO!!! I was served with fresh and heavenly tasting dishes. \n\nBoth the dishes were hot, fresh and tasted perfect. I personally loved the lemon chicken. It was creamy tangy and perrrfect.\nThe place was spotless and everything was perfect.\n\nOverall 10/10 will defiantly go back in a day or so for a complete dinner.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-23T15:34:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-24T00:00:37+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100006083859539","name":"Muhammad Amir"},{"id":"518981526","name":"Faryal Shah"},{"id":"1718458022","name":"Anwar Hashim"},{"id":"100000424156000","name":"Afza Khan"},{"id":"524835210","name":"Ali Dayo"},{"id":"732365126","name":"Shehla Zuberi"},{"id":"100000169425889","name":"Huma Sikandar"},{"id":"100000537867391","name":"Jawad Multani"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"692650033","name":"Shahbaz Khan"},{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"1429600174","name":"Shumail Ahmad"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"648503715","name":"Ahsan Mansoor Khan"},{"id":"100001388892633","name":"Zahra Mirza"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"100004544739993","name":"Anum Shafi"},{"id":"653605594","name":"Muniba Ahmed"},{"id":"718836477","name":"Soofia Shaikh"},{"id":"588690602","name":"Hamza Badar"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA1OTkwMTU1","before":"MTAwMDA2MDgzODU5NTM5"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_608519535865867/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTA1OTkwMTU1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"608522965865524","from":{"name":"Imran Latif","id":"100003283819114"},"message":"dekha I tld u naa? u will be servd with the bestt...(Y)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-23T15:49:38+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"608523745865446","from":{"name":"Umar Asad","id":"686720963"},"message":"thank you. come again","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-23T15:52:16+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"608530975864723","from":{"name":"Khalid Saleem","id":"657031744"},"message":"do they extend this sort of courtesy to guys too???","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-23T16:17:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"608531375864683","from":{"name":"Umar Asad","id":"686720963"},"message":"never Khalid Saleem. ladies are treated specially everywhere","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-23T16:18:54+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem","type":"user","offset":6,"length":13}]},{"id":"608531782531309","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Well I'm pretty sure that is not the case.

A place of traditional Desi  Khaba and it is quite famous that they usually eat with their full?. Love to eat ?.Specially Desi Ghee Stuff either its Karahi either its Fish or etc.\nUnfortunately the both guests by profession were Doctor?s even one of them was a highly known surgeon \n@ 9.25 I reached at kolachi before that I had ?NO? reservation I thought its Monday so at Do Darya it will No Crowded at kolachi ..When I reached it was packed jam and on call it was 56# minimum 1 hour wait?\nI know the owner?s Owais very well and even Umair but both of them were not present suddenly I asked from a attendant who else is looking after him. He took Mr.Amir Name I want to that guy directly and I just simply request him that we are four people and I have guest from Lahore and I called Awais for the reservation however I was dishonest  itna to chalta hai na yar!\nYou know what he did he moved us all the way on a prime location on top which was really WOW. It was full moon yesterday and the view was extremely awesome don?t have words to express. \nI order Fish, Grilled BBQ Prawns, Chicken Reshmi Kabab,Peshawari Karahi,?.\nThe best part was they served in once and it was well maintained in temperature, Quality & quantity \nThe Guest was impressed by the Fish Taste!  Usually they had fry fish in Lahore ,Sardar or Bashir Darulmahi wala are best in Lahore but again the difference was fresh water and a Sea Fish.\nI was stunned by the service standards the best part was after every 5-10 minute there was one new attendant coming and asking need anything else sir, you liked the food etc. \nI strongly believe one should have to profuse with his service standards in a completion war either its taste either its services should have to up come with its own standard?s and have the raise the bar which I guess kolachi did in real.\nThe best part wow to WaoOOoo factor was I asked him for the bill which was 11,000 for four people I just had a pause that I took 6000 cash which I thought will be enough I was like Wooooffffffffffff I checked the bill again and call the waiter are you sure it?s mine twice he said ?yes? Sir then I asked again politely just have another confirmation unfortunately the bill was exchanged with other table he made apology on this but I guess it was another great experience with Kolachi?.\nOvais,Umair & Amir, Great Work Guys \nKeep the Bar high and for other Restaurant?s I don?t want you to get disappoint but dear all serious time to think!\nValue against Money !","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-20T09:02:23+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-21T07:01:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"685959051","name":"Ali Hasan"},{"id":"100001252885971","name":"Marium Sultana"},{"id":"1048532624","name":"Syed Nawfil Rahim"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"789225723","name":"Lalarukh Khursheed Farooqui"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"},{"id":"698359177","name":"Mashal Iftikhar"},{"id":"752330337","name":"Faiz Kazi"},{"id":"558178102","name":"Safoora Fahad"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg1NTA1ODY2","before":"NTI0NDc2NzM1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"606461179405036","from":{"name":"Noveen Siddiqui","id":"520455792"},"message":"Lovvvv this post!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T10:26:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606481659402988","from":{"name":"Syed Nawfil Rahim","id":"1048532624"},"message":"Kolachi make you say WOW!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T11:42:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606561942728293","from":{"name":"Huma Zunnoon Khan","id":"100000710303249"},"message":"wondering wat if the bill was correct ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T13:26:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606562169394937","from":{"name":"Huma Zunnoon Khan","id":"100000710303249"},"message":"* wld have been","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T13:27:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606568629394291","from":{"name":"Noveen Siddiqui","id":"520455792"},"message":"Huma kitni buri baat hai...

I am sorry but I dont agree with you on this.\nLets go step by step.\nStarting with Sajjad Restaurant taking only spill over crowd ? I think Sajjad and Kolachi both come under the same league. Everyone has a different taste but at the same time I think Sajjad has a good fan following and many loyal customers. Plus its a bigger restaurant so it can absorb more walk in customers. \nNext is food.\nYour food can be written as creatively as you want. If you want a chicken dhaka (one of their most popular dish) to be just some average chicken pakora then be it. It can at the same time be crispy fillets of breast chicken batter coated and fried to perfection, served with fries onion rings and sauces, the perfect start to your meal.\n\nIn the same way even the best of karhais for you might be a handful of botis cooked in a karhai, with tomatoes and green chillies.\nWhat I also didnt understand was the fact that following your list of complains it was written that the it was not bad. No smell in the meat and it was tender and cooked in the right way.\nSo was it good or bad ???\n\nAnyhow I wish you a speedy recovery from your medical condition and I hope you enjoy the meal.\nCheers","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-19T18:31:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606013989449755","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Razak Latif first of all Aamir Basrai is the last person to give a false account of his experience.

Had some squash juices and milk roohafza on the table prior Iftar, the iftar menu was fine, later when it came to the mains that is when i started regretting LQ. The food variety was not big and it lacked quality and taste, opted for tempura prawns and there it lied a small prawn in the big oily crispy coating. Then went for some BBQ. It was so so, then found something with a name tag of Shahzada Salim Khas.. on my curiosity i took a bit and there it was Pasta Alfredo. Seriously did the mughals had Pastas at that time LOL. That is some serious Epic Joke. Out of all those dishes around this was re-named. Went on to Fish Tikka, too much salt in it with no such flavors. The chinese almost ended. Then tried Sajji, it did some justice compared to other food. It was later I shifted to Deserts and had some bit of various sweets. The Shahi Tukra had nothing Shahi in them !! The labe shereen was fine others were upto LQ expectations !! The food was seriously low quality and taste, with attentive service. Rs 1250/- per head exclusive drinks. Seriously it does not in any way does justice. Went to Kolachi a week ago and i Must say it was worth every penny. I would give LQ 2/10. On the top there was a clown who was roamin around while scratching his balls, now thats Seriously Gross !!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-03T07:38:33+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-03T09:36:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003597648202","name":"Maha Sayeed"},{"id":"690005614","name":"Owais Asif"},{"id":"100003619006169","name":"Hajrah Humayun"},{"id":"100000155371840","name":"Sabih Kirmani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwMTU1MzcxODQw","before":"MTAwMDAzNTk3NjQ4MjAy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"597400196977801","from":{"name":"Zuhair Haider Naqvi","id":"535085629"},"message":"Khuwar admi.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-03T07:40:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597426193641868","from":{"name":"Tatheer Naqvi","id":"517591959"},"message":"A clown scratching his balls :/ Disturbing.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-03T09:30:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597426483641839","from":{"name":"Azam Hasan","id":"693010374"},"message":"Tatheer Lol at your previous Comment !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-03T09:32:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"517591959","name":"Tatheer","type":"user","offset":0,"length":7}]},{"id":"597427570308397","from":{"name":"Tatheer Naqvi","id":"517591959"},"message":"HAHAHA oh well when I imagined the entire scene(which automatically appeared as a scene in my head)  and iftari on your table with a scary clown going all pervy around you, the word 'disturbing' seemed appropriate :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-03T09:36:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTk3NDI3NTcwMzA4Mzk3","before":"NTk3NDAwMTk2OTc3ODAx"}}},"restaurantName":"Kolachi"},{"id":"165861103465048_596894097028411","from":{"name":"Imran Sheikh","id":"545220720"},"message":"Trying Sajjad Restaurant for the first time tonight for Iftar, hope its as good as I've heard!

As previously complained ^^. around Iftar lots of things were already finished, which is understandable, the workers have to open their fast as well, but no excuse for that later in the evening ... \n\nSometimes I got lucky and got warm, fresh food (mostly from the live counters), which was definitely on par. \n\nAbout the food, it was good, the spice was on point. The mutton Karhai, mutton & chicken sajji, and the fried fish were all excellent.\n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed, and at that price point (1200) , I would have much rather visited Kolachi. I give it a 6/10, and probably wouldn't visit again for their Iftar buffet, or recommend it..\n\nMaybe they had an off-day.

So yesterday I decided to give them a visit. And with no surprises, everything I heard was true. Endless variety of food including BBQ, Chinese, Handi, Afghani, Italian,etc. ,etc., and what not. Although, the differentiating factor which separates Kolachi from all other infinite menu list buffets in town, each and every item was fresh and scrumptious and hard to resist, making it impossible to taste all of them. Specialties being Prawn tempura, Malai Boti, Paneer Reshmi, OOzi and Karhai. These are items for which you definitely need reserve some space in your appetite. And what to say about desserts, simply divine and celestial.\nA few negligible cons, long ques on high running items but visible efforts by staff to manage the crowd.  Secondly, when I called them two days back to reserve the water front table, I was told that they are not making reservations. Therefore I made sure to reach max by 6:15 pm, and was told that all water front tables are already reserved!!!!! And lastly the sitting area in the lounge was very hot and dark and to make it worse, red dim light hanging over our head. \nAll in all, I would like to thank Kolachi for treating my taste buds although there is still room to improve their aesthetics.\nScore : 8.5 /10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-02T06:15:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-02T10:27:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"716476797","name":"Rania Jawaid"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"690005614","name":"Owais Asif"},{"id":"100000108654676","name":"Samia Hyder"},{"id":"100002991745435","name":"Asmma Omer Khan"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"1200204425","name":"Sana Zaidi"},{"id":"100003829944979","name":"Saba Farooq"},{"id":"660435505","name":"Sajjad Bin Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjYwNDM1NTA1","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"596871450364009","from":{"name":"Saad Ahmed Qureshi","id":"739137597"},"message":"thnx for the detailed review, its helpfull","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-02T10:27:53+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTk2ODcxNDUwMzY0MDA5","before":"NTk2ODcxNDUwMzY0MDA5"}}},"restaurantName":"Kolachi"},{"id":"165861103465048_596745563709931","from":{"name":"M.Shahzad Sarwar","id":"846160404"},"message":"Can anyone share their experience of Kolachi food , their best ?

We had no prior booking and arrived at around 6:50pm. There were just 2 of us and due to some no show(s) we got a table. It was not the best table as it was right above the kitchen and smoke from there making things a little uncomfortable but when we asked the section staff to find another table for us, they were quite keen to find us another table but it was packed to full capacity. We are off to not so good start, as ambiance which is always a crucial part of any Kolachi experience was quite ruined due to that. But hey it was not all over yet.\n\nIftar was served and there was plenty to choose from; pakoras, samosas, chana chaat, dahi phulkis, chicken wings, chicken drumsticks, lahori fish, fruit chaat.. among drinks there was roh-afza, lemonade, mango squash and lassi. I tried chana chaat, chicken wings and drumsticks and lahori fish. everything was quite good, esp chicken wings and drumsticks were both high on taste. I didn't try the rest even though it looked so tempting but I was saving space for dinner. \n\nDinner was followed by iftar and the variety just got wider. There was a salad bar. Prawn tempura, chicken Manchurian, oyster beef(frankly I don't remember the sauce), chicken chowmein, fried rice, thai curry, julienne beef, alfredo pasta, mini burgers were among non desi items. Also hot and sour and corn soup. Those dishes can be avoided in favour of what Kolachi is actually loved for. But still if too tempted go for julienne beef, it was moist and succulent. \n\nAmong desi items there was biryani, nihari, haleem, white karhai, kunna. Again I only tried haleem among it all as there is so much one can stuff oneself with. \n\nKolachi's favourties included hunzai handi, paneer reshmi, peshawari karhai, malai boti, bihari tikka, seekh kebab and 3 types of naan. That's the section one should save most space for. Everything was usual delightful and you get half your money's worth just in that section.(As if rest of the variety was any lesser).\n\nFor rest of the half your money's worth, there is a speciality called oozi. Lamb served with rice, it was love at first bite. I am sure most of you would be going back for a second serve.\n\nThere were plenty to choose from the desserts section. I am sure I have missed out on some items from that extensive menu.\n\nAs far as variety goes, it can't get any better. 10/10\n\nService was usual friendly and attentive. Esp youngsters running the show are very dedicated and you see them passionately working with their staff to make sure everything is going right. Hats off to them.\n\nOverall 8/10, since I couldn't get a better table which was in no way Kolachi's fault but it did make a slight dent in my overall experience and some non desi variety was not Kolachi good. \n\nTo those who are annoyed by the mention of Kolachi, sorry guys but we need to appreciate good things in life and Kolachi has definitely earned it. way to go !!\n\nHighly Recommended any time :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-01T09:23:14+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-02T02:36:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100003553069288","name":"Chanelle Adam Khan"},{"id":"622532960","name":"Ayesha Qureshi"},{"id":"1091359728","name":"Anila Noman"},{"id":"543131941","name":"Morag Khan"},{"id":"1257283317","name":"Aymun Zafar"},{"id":"1368416951","name":"Muhammad Jamal"},{"id":"777939362","name":"Faaiz Deda"},{"id":"1248903988","name":"Amal Faisal Ashoor"},{"id":"672220217","name":"Sukaina Ali"},{"id":"1285044693","name":"Sami Ibrahim Tamimi"},{"id":"592929129","name":"Aqsa Jaliawala"},{"id":"517470504","name":"Nida Ali"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"511130593","name":"Layla Rizvi"},{"id":"100002643873225","name":"Fatima Haider"},{"id":"586930217","name":"Maheen Ahsan"},{"id":"751819688","name":"Erum Hamza"},{"id":"1346742308","name":"Ijlal Malik"},{"id":"520115164","name":"M Usman Khaled"},{"id":"547996286","name":"Shahzaib Javaid"},{"id":"1586595597","name":"Khurram Iqbal"},{"id":"555766150","name":"Faruk Lania"},{"id":"696432032","name":"Samiullah Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk2NDMyMDMy","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_596242730426881/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjk2NDMyMDMy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"596249420426212","from":{"name":"Rizwana Shamim","id":"663526141"},"message":"happy reading :) Go kolachi Go :):)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-01T10:00:11+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"596251557092665","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"Shazeb Siddiki","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-01T10:07:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"745715077","name":"Shazeb Siddiki","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]},{"id":"596253257092495","from":{"name":"Hira Saiyed","id":"867800502"},"message":"Oh thank you.

Food was good and decent. Ordered white and brown chicken karahi with afghani and roghani nan. Herb Raita came along with it. Whole package was heaven, as good as probably what we get on super highway. 3 bbq Shahi chicken paneer which was cottage cheese with seasonings and herbs filling, tasted amazing with different flavors tingling  taste buds. Not forgetting the mint chutney dip with it. Drinks salad came along. Everything ended up with a nice cup of dhood patti chai. Dutch scene came round about to decent 550 per head with 10 person.

Dont tell baby, pinky and gudoo to bring their plates so you can fill them till the food starts falling off their plates. \n\nAnd these are the same people who follow every single rule when theyre outside Pakistan.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-21T16:44:01+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-21T21:51:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"514264591","name":"Aena Rizvi"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"679913965","name":"Hina Dhanani"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"690005614","name":"Owais Asif"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"585967958","name":"Aleema Younus"},{"id":"642555611","name":"Umama Rizvi Walana"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000827449826","name":"Shahid Ali"},{"id":"100001897462646","name":"Akbar Yezdani"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"707095378","name":"Daniyal Usama"},{"id":"860510556","name":"Sabeen Qamar"},{"id":"1511932369","name":"Arham Bagasra"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"749361345","name":"Hasnain Raza"},{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"},{"id":"531715536","name":"Taimoor Aslam"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTMxNzE1NTM2","before":"NTE0MjY0NTkx"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_589756101075544/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTMxNzE1NTM2"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"589756617742159","from":{"name":"Ibrahim Ahmed","id":"1131235634"},"message":"nice one","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T16:45:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589757214408766","from":{"name":"Rehman Saleemi","id":"812005693"},"message":"Kolachi and similar places around Kolachi have become very public recently.You get to see a mixed crowd there.

Mirage is the only buffet themed restaurant at Do-Darya and is located right next to Kolachi. The ambience is nothing to write about as it?s almost the same as Kolachi, Charcoal, etc. We booked the whole upper deck unanimously for the view and later regretted the decision as the main food stations were downstairs.\nThe food stations are divided into 3 areas. The main food station is at the entrance while the BBQ section is at the upper left corner of the restaurant. The dessert and salad bar is in the top right corner.\nFor the price (Rs. 1000 per person inclusive of 1 soft drink) the food was very good. There were fresh batair?s (better than Lal-Qila?s), fried prawn tempura, Chicken Biryani, Goan Fish Curry, Chapli Kabab, pani puri are just some of the dishes that were tasted. The highlights however were the BBQ and the live chicken Karhai. The BBQ consisted of Chicken Malai Boti, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Chicken Tikka and Beef Namkeen Boti. The Malai Boti was succulent (but a little sweet for my taste) while Reshmi Kabab and Tikka were awesomely cooked (and Thank God not overcooked)  bu the Beef Namkeen Boti stole the show as it literally melted in our mouths.\nThe Karhai also has 4 varieties namely Peneer White, Peshawari Red, Green Masala and Namkeen Red Karhai. All four varieties were delicious and much better than what Kolachi serves.\nThe let down at Mirage were the salad and dessert station due to same variety as other buffets and also fried fish and the pasta dishes.\nOverall we really enjoyed our food and had a fantastic evening. Best part was that there was no hassle from the waiters or the mangers to clear the table (like they do at Kolachi & Ginsoy).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-27T18:52:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T09:29:10+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"736425186","name":"Maryam Zahoor Ansari"},{"id":"772910592","name":"Shyam Sunder"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"100000226962956","name":"Sumiaya Arif"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"711050864","name":"Abdul Raheem Khan"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"NzM2NDI1MTg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"548935991824222","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Aaquib Arif","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-27T21:28:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"549210141796807","from":{"name":"Zarfras Siddiki","id":"100003898006618"},"message":"seems they(Kolachi and Ginsoy) are quite busy in their business and they care for walk in customers,to avoid waiting in queue,,caring for customers by Kolachi and Ginsoy thats good,,","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T08:19:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549233218461166","from":{"name":"Muhammed Umer Mulla","id":"595408686"},"message":"Well yes but what if you are in thr middle of a meal and the bill is presented to you or when you try to relax the waiter constantly remind you to clear the table as they have a big cue....I mean can't they wait for say 5 mins","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T09:48:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549380488446439","from":{"name":"Sumiaya Arif","id":"100000226962956"},"message":"I second that muhammed umer mulla","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T14:42:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549876995063455","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"5-7 Mins should be max before which the Bill sould be asked for & settled.

There are some good restaurants that provide good value for money (e.g. kolachi ? from top of my head) but then many other places are charging ridiculous amounts of money that just doesn?t make sense.\n\nE.g. restaurants charging rs.150 for a bottle of mineral water?? Rs.50 for a nan? Just came back from watching a movie on atrium with dad and decided to munch on a few snacks. Ordered chicken Florentine crepe from the stall of ?the crepe factory?. The crepe was for Rs.250 and I decided to just check out how he?s making it cuz of my passion for food. He literally put 4 miniscule quarter bite size chicken bits is all I can say with some wet paste type spinach from the fridge and a small bit of cheese. The chicken smelled putrid and my dad gave up after a few bites. But leaving aside the quantity does it really justify to charge Rs.250 for that?\n\nSimilarly I took a chicken tikka deal from chacha jee which was for Rs. 300. With two small sticks containing chicken thigh barbeques pieces. I mean one can get a decent quarter size chicken tikka for Rs.180-200 from any club?\n\nIn uk there is a law that a customer may pay a certain amount for food that he perceives is the right value for it. E.g. if he has been served rotten food he can pay a pound and leave despite the actual price being much higher. He cant leave without paying that then consitutes as a crime. However legally if taken up he has to prove that it was worth 1 pound.\n\nIs it just me or are restaurants just charging obscenely? I think value for money should be taken up on this forum as an interesting thread discussion that may lead to some restaurant realizing that they need to start setting price points more appropriately!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-14T22:01:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-16T07:54:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"100003553069288","name":"Chanelle Adam Khan"},{"id":"100001822097920","name":"Sara Kazmi"},{"id":"1071574922","name":"Madihah Yunus"},{"id":"680080236","name":"Naiha Zafar"},{"id":"1108385601","name":"Marvi Jatoi"},{"id":"738315558","name":"Talal Yahya"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1464463541","name":"Mehreen Farhan"},{"id":"689771441","name":"Riffat Fawad Bukhari"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"1565510392","name":"Naheed Siddiq"},{"id":"1793536667","name":"Faiza M.

(Valet Parking - thank God) No reservations, but we were ushered to our seats in a matter of moments, lovely view. Opted for the Desi stuff. Ordered Peshawari Karahi, Malai Boti, Beef Seekh Kebab, Mutton Masla Chops and some boti's (forgot the name....Maybe Hunza boti's ?)..... Food prepared and arrived within 15 minutes accompanied with Puri Paratha, Kolachi Naan and Roghni Naan. Everything was delicious, my favourite were the Mutton Masala Chops and the Karahi. Floor Manager presented himself to us half way through and asked us if everything was to our liking esp food temp, quality and taste, and was very genuine in his offer to change anything which we thought was not to our satisfaction.

Glad that you enjoyed your visit. As far as the credit cards are concerned , sadly the do drya belt does not have a land lines so having wired credit card machines that mostly resturant uses become out of question. \n\nWe did try using microchip machines that work on wireless but these machines some times work and some times dont just like mobile phones in that area. When they work every thing is good , but when they dont it becomes a embarassing situation for both the customer and the management. Therefore we have given up the credit card system until we get a proper landline. Please bear with us till than . \n\nNevertheless we respect and appreciate Karchites for going through the inconvenience of carrying cash and dinning at Kolachi.

Anyways, not to dwell into farewell depression, i tried my best to cover all eateries as i could. Summary and ranking goes like:\n\nNew places:\n1. Bella vita- great gelato and a very different pizza! Must visit\n\n2. Kolachi- full marks for ambience( despite 50min wait) and one if the best beef botis, though garlic rice were a big disappointment! Karahi was great!\n\n3. Olivetto- tried there pan asian prawns with rice! Sluurrpp! Veryyyyy nice and must try!\n\n4. Xanders- very nice tomato soup and calamari starter, but the menu lacked depth for dinner. Suggest it to be a breakfast/brunch place thn dinners. Ordered jalape?o chicken pizza but the staff mistakenly served margarita. But they were courteous and apologetic! Hence, forgiven.\n\nOldies which are still goldies:\n\nNo one can beat Zahid ki nihari with garam garam naan still!!!\n\nBots was supreme!! The food covered up for poor service! Honestly, once it arrived (prawn karahi, fried pangush fish, fried prawns)we forgot tht it took ages to get someone to clean the table and take thr order. Ad always, didnt disappoint at all.\n\nTai pan- suprisingly great lunch food! Unlike many years ago whn i went and got served with a bee in the soup :) but this time,everything was awesome.\n\nGlorias beef chilli wrap also was a fav this trip!\n\nBoat basin ka subah ka halwa puri had still maintained its 'to die for' value! The dhaba roadside fun i miss!\n\nNandos- lemme tell you this, pakistans nandos takes the prize of the best nandos around! The depth in menu and the taste is what makes it the best!\n\nDynasty- unfotunately trip to dynasty was marred by sudden bout of sickness, and getting all food packed without even looking- the other disappointment was one of the best hotels in town didnt have panadol in first aid, and the pharmacy hd closed at 9! Made me wonder, wat wud guests do if they needed it in middle of night.\n\nChairman mao- no compromise on quality- still the same good hot n sour soup, chicken schezuan and fried rice!\n\nChatkharay and gazebo- never fail to bring your taste buds alive with the bun kabab, chaat and qeema!\n\nAnddd pompei- blue cheese pizza rocks my socks :)\n\nYummmmm!

The kids loved it!\nPaneer Reshmi Handi.. Delicious, but a tad bit over-rated. Honestly speaking, it tasted just like pasta in white sauce sans the pasta! This was pointed out by my 7-year old, and after that I had a hard time eating it with naan. :/\nSeekh Kababs, Behari Chicken Boneless, and Malai Tikka.. all were good but I've had better! Malai tikka was slightly undercooked. (Seriously!!)\nGarlic naans: the first two were dry and hard, the third one was soft and fluffy (since we had complained about the first batch) and then the fourth one was again like the first two.  \n\nAll food was delivered hot and fresh (barring the naans), and stayed so despite the open air seating.

Menu is rather limited and although it is presented rather nicely on a chalk board, the menu does NOT mention prices! That is bound to give many a heart a bit of an arrhythmia, specially those who will be paying the bill for the evening! The bread basket (served on a plate) was rather abbreviated. Clam chowder was nice and thick with the right amount of solids, but too tangy. The seafood gratin was too salty and the Verde chicken was a surprise: sweet more than savory. Perhaps it was meant to be so (fusion of some sort) but since there was no description available on the menu board, nor volunteered but he waiter, the first bite came as a bit of a shock. The place offers 3 items in its desserts, of which one was not available. Brownie with ice cream was fine (but it would be tough to go wrong with that) and the other available item, the lemon tart, seemed to be in two components, the top totally dissociated with the bottom. Coffees were excellent.\nAlthough we had chosen to sit inside the glass box, but the excellent atmosphere was destroyed when a bunch of school boys decided to start smoking in the closed environment. Midway through the meal we had to make a request to be relocated outside. The inside part of the restaurant should be strictly non smoking. Outside was actually more pleasant this evening than the air-conditioned inside. \nVerdict: We will certainly revisit Verde again?..for coffee, after dinner at Aylanto!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-02T17:36:31+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-02T19:38:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"622525326","name":"Mohsin E Azam"},{"id":"1035164226","name":"Daniyal Aamir"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"516133963","name":"Haadia Farooqui"},{"id":"881200022","name":"Amna Alam"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"558690791","name":"Zehra Zaidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTU4NjkwNzkx","before":"NjIyNTI1MzI2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"455059737878515","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"And I thought I was the only doctor who is a food critique in town. \n\nThank you for a very detailed and surgically precise review.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-02T18:02:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"455089874542168","from":{"name":"Amenah Jafarey","id":"671130091"},"message":"Love this AC.

Even though the place was packed to its full capacity, our company of 3 was accommodated without a reservation, after a short wait ... As my friend from NY wanted to have something desi, so I ordered Chicken Makhni & Garlic & Roghni nan to accompany it, the other friend wanted to have a sandwich but was unsure, what type, reluctantly she ordered the grilled sandwich... even after the placed order our server noticed the apprehension on my friends face,went & asked his Chef (Noor) to help us with the issue at hand :p.... Anyway Noor was the most humble guy, he inquired my friend what type of a sandwich she would like, after getting a description, he went & cooked up this most amazing nanwich, that I have ever tried (My experience with Koel has been super bad).... The chicken in the sandwich was succulent, cooked in tomato puree, mushroom, onions, with a pinch of mexican spices & garam masala.... Noor personally came back to the table & inquired if will liked it & we were like this is something we would be coming for over & over again... He also told us that he was from gilgit/hunza side & that he was part of the show Foodistan as well....All in all the chat along with the food was quiet interesting.... He is a great guy! and genius of a chef!!\n\nNow coming to the makhni, unlike the makhni handi I have tried at numerous places this particular dish was different...  Instead of just being buttery, it packed a punch with spices which were not overpowering but would hit the back of the palate in a pleasant manner... I loved it!!!... \n\nOne thing that I forgot to mention, remember that grilled sandwich, that order was never cancelled by the server, so in the end, that too landed up on our table..We did tell them that this was cancelled because of the nanawich but Chef Noor again came on our table & insisted that the naanwich was on the house...Anyway coming to the sandwich, the salad, the chicken marination, the bread used were all fresh & tasted light & wonderful... \n\nKolachi brownie points:\n\nLocation (Sea of course)\nAmbiance (Gorgeous)\nService (Impeccable/Hospitable)\nFood (Amazing)\nPricing (We paid 2100 inclusive of tip for 3 people & had drinks too)\n\nI was officially in food coma last night after my visit to the place....

I guess the there was a misunderstanding between the phone operator and you. Due to the Eid holidays we are getting a lot of rush Mashallah. Therefore we were  taking the last reservation for 8.30 . What we were trying to communicate to all our valued customers was to come around 8.30 to get guaranteed seats without waiting. \nDue to Eid rush , we wre getting packed by walk-in customers by 8.00 or maximum 8.15 which is unusual. Now honouring a 9.30 reservation becomes difficult because we can never imagine to ask any of our customers to leave or get up from the table. So the customers arriving after 8.30  are requested to wait until the table gets free. \n\nNevertheless we are still working on further streamlining the reservation system through which we could easily accommodate customers asking for reservation after 8.30 by introducing the time slot system. \n\nBut still Shiraz my apologies once again for any inconvenience caused. \n\nYOU AND OTHER CUSTOMERS LIKE YOU ARE THE REAL SPIRIT OF KOLACHI AND YOU WOULD ALWAYS BE OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-23T22:24:59+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"427387550645734","from":{"name":"Shiraz Qureshi","id":"574028031"},"message":"thanks for your response Syed Faizan Rahim. i totally understand your point and i m sure the crowd u guys are handlng these days is definitely huge.  i loved the way you guys hv made this place and thts the reason wanted to bring my whole family for my younger brothers birthday dinner tonight.. we wil b trying our luck around 8 - 830 with a family of 15 to 18 ppl. hope we get lucky.  :) ?and yeah you definitely need to upgrade the reservation process ! ;) . all the best. and keep up the good work.

The waiters were not expecting such a large crowd on Eid day or probably were too relaxed and expecting the diners to go and get the food, as was the case during Ramadan's buffet, as we had to tell them at least twice or thrice if we needed anything. \nThe ? la carte menu had a few items marked \" * \" or \" ** \" that supposedly referred to chefs' recommendations, however, the waiter did not know why were those items marked asterisk. The BBQ lacked taste and the meet used especially in Afghani Boti was neither fresh nor properly washed and cleaned. \nOne does understand that the service was slow due to the rush but compromising on quality of food was something not justified. \nI hope they work on this because the ramadan buffet has already raised up everyone's expectations.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-21T13:49:09+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-21T16:13:27+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"426463947404761","from":{"name":"Tania Danish","id":"657325696"},"message":"I went for dinner during Ramadan around tenish, it was jam packed but we got a table in half hr, but the view did justice to the wait.

Esp the lasagne and the khatta aloo\n- Necos - went there thrice, esp because of the dessert, which unfortunately wasnt there the last time (the choc souffle n mango and cream). However, the one problem i noticed all three times was that the food kept finishing and wasnt refilled at the right time. Seemed ok in the first week of Ramzan but shuoldve fixed the problem by the last. Oh well.\n- Kolachi - Great food, but tooooooo crowded. Wouldnt bother going for iftar again. Definitely would try it on another day for food.\n- Cafe Blue Ginger - Good food. Rubbish service.\n- Deli - Excellent menu selection and food was really tasty. The red curry was a tad bit too spicy though.\n- Bella Vita - AMAZING Midnight meal","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-19T22:19:26+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-19T23:15:37+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"670455362","name":"Faiza Taqi Hassan"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"1079332060","name":"Farheen Omer"},{"id":"685460614","name":"Nida Sattar-Saad"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ2NjY0NTM4","before":"NjcwNDU1MzYy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"425926920791797","from":{"name":"Abbas Bootwala","id":"603100292"},"message":"why does ramzan has to 'finally' get over?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-19T23:11:39+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"425927547458401","from":{"name":"Bushra Nadeem Hussain","id":"506693362"},"message":"just an expression. this was really a food review thats all :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-19T23:15:37+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDI1OTI3NTQ3NDU4NDAx","before":"NDI1OTI2OTIwNzkxNzk3"}}},"restaurantName":"Kolachi"},{"id":"165861103465048_425739904143832","from":{"name":"Imran Nanjiani","id":"1092810743"},"message":"Will Kolachi be open tomorrow?

The exterior of the venue looks classy but that's about it i guess. Being generous i would give food hardly 6.5/10 minus desserts. There were 2 desserts, one was some trifle kinda dish that i stopped eating after tasting it. The other however was the most ridiculous item, \"cream bruelay\". Not only was it spelled wrong, it looked nothing like \"creme brulee\". It looked like some \"raita with lots of zeera\" in it. When that was pointed to the host very politely, he walked away saying that he would check into it. He never returned to our table and didn't even greet us as we left even though he was standing right there(the same person was trying to be very friendly and attentive in the beginning but couldn't take one genuine criticism which probably helped the place being made fun of). Also there were no other tables occupied but us and one other table, no wonder. Lots teenagers started popping up shortly after maghrib, for sheesha i suppose. over all 1099+tax price tag was too much for such an average experience. I wish i had gone to tired and tested neco's/hobnob/arizona/roasters or Kolachi which i am dying to go after such rave reviews.

Service was very good considering the rush, we got seated promptly without making a reservation around 7 pm. Waiters were for the most part attentive and available.

Don't remember now how much it costs but I was shocked at the price. \n\nBandu Khan: Seekh Kababs and parahtas dont get better... regret not going to meerath :( \n\nBar B Que Tonight: Ribs were brilliant, the rest was good as always. Never been a big fan but there is a reason its the most popular restaurant in khi.\n\nChips: Roast Beef Burger as good as always, but much smaller than what it use to be. \n\nCafe Flo: The lamb Shang was out of this world in taste and the meet was perfectly cooked. Also had a few bites of their undercut steak, good as usual.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-27T10:31:57+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-27T12:05:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"680185313","name":"Khalid Ishaq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjgwMTg1MzEz","before":"NjgwMTg1MzEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"417474938303662","from":{"name":"Reza Jivani","id":"683105140"},"message":"Try out Kolachi @ seaview, the cafe at pie in sky (zamzama) and Bread Basket for the cheese naan! :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-27T11:03:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417488551635634","from":{"name":"Shaan Agha","id":"517358087"},"message":"I have always been a big fan of pie in the sky cheese cakes.

With the expectation bar at its peak after hearing and reading so much about it on SWOT and outside, I was a bit apprehensive while going. What if it doesn?t turn out as good? What if my grandiose expectations fall flat? Oh well. Nevermind, I reassured myself and our group of 10 with bachas in it went ahead. We reached well after 830pm thanks to the jam packed sea view road that tested both my patience and driving skills. Finally when we reached we were told by the courteous lady at the entrance that we?ll have to wait for anywhere between 30 to 40 minutes to get a table for 10. Though I was warned of the weekend rush that picks up after 830pm my own miscalculation prevented me from pre-booking. Thanks to Muneer Esmail and the ever courteous staff of Kolachi, we managed to get a table well before the time given. And what a lovely spot it was. I could?ve easily spent hours sitting up on the deck overlooking the sea and enjoying the lovely environs. Kolachi cleared its first test with full marks! \n\nThe gentleman who appeared to be the Manager helped us settle and ensured we were comfortable. Our group relied on me to order (knowing fully well that I am the worst at the job). However, thanks to my earlier post on SWOT, I had received some recommendations and decided to play safe. So my pick included Paneer Reshmi Handi, Peshawari Karhai (in Chicken as the group was not inclined towards red meat) and Kolachi Reshmi Kabab. As much as we wanted to try out starters, we chose not too as the popcorns at Cineplex right before the journey to Kolachi didn?t allow that. So we settled on the main course. For this trip only! \n\nBachas in our group are notorious for ordering fries wherever they go! They frown and fret and make a fuss if they don?t find their favorite starter. Fortunately Kolachi didn?t let us down there! Kids were happy with cheesy and Masala fries to start off their meal. For drinks, I went ahead with Muneer?s recommendation and ordered Blue Colada. Some in the group ordered Lemon Mint Glacier while the rest settled for soft drinks or fresh lime. \n\nFood at Kolachi came, saw and conquered! Literally! Paneer Reshmi Handi was well beyond our expectations. It was simply divine! I profusely thanked SWOTTIES who recommended it!! I wanted to devour more than my appetite allowed. And I did. Peshawari Karhai was well cooked and tasted heavenly. With roghni naan, the food was sheer delight. Reshmi Kababs were fresh and tender. They complemented well. \n\nI am forever thankful to Muneer for recommending Blue Colada! It was fantastic. I acted the bad one by not sharing it with anybody which I usually do. The evil me had it all and craved for more!! However I didn?t want to explode so resisted. There was no space left for even tea. So we got up after the lovely food and an excellent service. I must compliment the staff. I wonder how they remain so polite and attentive given the number of people frequenting the place and demanding personalized service! Hats off to the management of Kolachi. \n\nNeedless to say Kolachi is on my radar now and I?ll be visiting the place more often!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-16T06:26:33+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-16T19:42:33+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"688336352","name":"Abbas Farid"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI1OTY4OTUz","before":"NTI0NDc2NzM1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"413375985380224","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Yum!!

Golden Dragon - My new love for Thai and Chinese food. Hot favourites: American Chopsuey, Crispy Beef, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Hot and Sour Soup, Thai Soup, Thai Green Curry, Wontons, Zingers and Chicken Karhai (the last two from their Lunch Xpress section)\n\n2. Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb's warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I'm not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away. Will go soon to be blown away by other things too.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-25T18:59:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-27T14:47:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"505164013","name":"Yasmeen Agad-Kothawala"},{"id":"515396294","name":"Danish Ali Dahraj"},{"id":"100003249618202","name":"Heer Ahmed"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"500907007","name":"Murtaza Moiz"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNjUxNzIy","before":"NjU3MDMxNzQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"404073356310487","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"i see myself featured here too, obliged and humbled Hajra Amir","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T19:33:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir","type":"user","offset":52,"length":10}]},{"id":"404123489638807","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Thank you Hajra :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T21:13:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra","type":"user","offset":10,"length":5}]},{"id":"404386042945885","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"These places are on my fingertips 24/7!!!

Ambiance was nice, a serene enviroment welcomes you on arrival. Unlike other places on that strip its not overcrowded despite having a crowded look on the outside. Seating arrangement is spacious and comfortable, with sofa's and chairs at three different levels. They have a upper deck, a middle level, a lower deck and a sheesha lounge, the middle two being right on the ocean and one can actually feel the tide come and hit the rocks below coupled will the flood lights on the sea which creates an enchanting effect.Coming to the service aspect both the staff and servers are more like programmed robots and need to be more vigilant to the diners needs, they keep sauntering around the place but to get hold of them is a tough task. A bottle of water took 15-20 minutes to arrive, its seemed like they were manufacturing it, drinks arrived ten minutes after dinner was served and I had to remind them, coordination is lacking and staff was not properly trained in this aspect. Ordered their Charcoal Combo platter, which was fresh and crisp comprising of batter fried mushrooms, chicken wings and fried chicken with mozzarella cheese accompanied with two yummy dips, also had the Beef Cheese Burger and Chicken Fajita Burger both well done, were well flavored, succulent pieces of grilled chicken breast and had a spicy tinge, but the bread was not as it should be, a bit soggy and quality of the bun could be improved, fries could be more crisp. For desert had Blueberry Cheese Cake was very good, light and fluffy with a biscuit crust, really melted in the mouth, a generous helping for two to three weight watchers. Overall experience was good, a place which stands out from the crowd and has an air of sophistication, recommended for foreign guests who may have the impression that Karachi is a city under siege or civil war, taking them to this places will showcase the soft face of Karachi and the beauty of the sea. They just need to work a tad bit more on their service.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-24T11:24:45+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-24T15:29:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"741265709","name":"Sarah Hasnat"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQxMjY1NzA5","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"403364046381418","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Try Kolachi next time.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T15:11:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403370973047392","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Kolachi is the next target...what do u recommend?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T15:27:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403372099713946","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Hunzai Handi.

It was so rich and creamy. Mmm! ? We asked the waiter to pack the remaining food.\n\nThen my brother ordered chocolate fudge ice-cream for dessert, which was okay. And me and my parents ordered zafrani kulfi, it was amazing! \n\nOverall experience was wonderful.

Enough said!\n\nTutti fruti Froyo: I love the fact that they keep bringing in new flavors every week. So far, my favourites have been lychee and peach\nBreakfast at Xanders: Tried their soft scrambled eggs, Xanders Club Sandwich, berry daiquiri and strawberry smoothie?absolutely loved the sandwich! I just wish they had pizza in the mornings too. I can have their pizza at all times of the day!\n\nKolachi:  Had heard alot about their makhani handi?taste was alright but left me feeling too heavy?could not have more than a few bites. I really liked the nachos there! The service there deserves special mention. I would definitely go there again.\n\nA One Rolls: Though I used to love the rolls there as compared to eaton, hot and spicy and other roll places, the past couple of times when I went there, the rolls were soggy and extremely oily. \n\nCup a Soup Chicken Laksa at Aghas: I was very hungry (starving actually lol) when I had it and really liked the lemony coconut soup. Would have preferred if it was just a tiny bit more on the sour side as that is the way I?ve had it in Malaysia. A little more punch can make it really Wow! Btw I tried to make it my way at home the next day (just added a little extra imlee ka pani) and it was fabulous!\n\nButlers for lunch today:  Turkey Club Sandwich was good to taste?however, it was falling apart and not too easy to manage. I did not try the spicy chicken sandwich and Butlers Club Sandwich but my friends seemed satisfied with them. The chocolate decadence and hazelnut dessert (oops forgot the name but the dessert itself was pretty forgettable :S!) were fine. I guess I wasn?t in the mood for sweets. \n\nOh I also attended a dinner event at Marriot. Why oh why does the food at 5star hotels have to be so bland????Loved the potato gratin though..just the right amount of cheese and garlic butter..yum!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-09T19:02:29+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-10T09:54:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"753461179","name":"Rohia Zohaib"},{"id":"682241004","name":"Atif Malik"},{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid"},{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"589485566","name":"Murwah Tariq-Atif"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"757449744","name":"Syed Sabih Abbas Razvi"},{"id":"828190023","name":"Shaheen Nouman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODI4MTkwMDIz","before":"NTUyMDA2MTU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"395602850490871","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"\u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T09:54:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzk1NjAyODUwNDkwODcx","before":"Mzk1NjAyODUwNDkwODcx"}}},"restaurantName":"Kolachi"},{"id":"165861103465048_394023780648778","from":{"name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf","id":"715045338"},"message":"I need some advice on what is recommended to order for Dinner at Charcoal BBQ and Grill.

And then I hear mostly good reviews about the same place. And when I do try the place, the positive vibes have been proved correct. Kolachi and Tutti Frutti are the 2 places in subject here. \n\nHad the chocolate and the original flavor and I am at a loss for words. This was the most amazing willy-wonka-ish experience since Funland. I felt like a kid in Disneyland. The froyo is yummy, the place is oozing with colors, smiles, flavor and so much positivity. I was delighted! The delegate was in a rush so we couldnt wait for the toppings (sad) but they looked yum. But anyways the fro-yo was to-die-for. No after taste, the original was tangy..just enough tangy.....and the chocolate was a little like dark chocolate...and mixed together it was heaven. Oh yeah and it had the best consistency right till the last lick. And yes priced beautifully. P.S - No receipts. But oh well.\n\nKolachi. Man. Charcoal's ambiance has taken a back seat in my books. WHAT a place, tastefully done, EXCELLENT sofas and seating, Kolachi is a must-visit. Now for the food, FINALLY  a place on phase 8 that is a complete package! Food AND ambiance! Had the Hunzai Handi. OMG. It was divine. The right balance of spice and gravy with soft tender pieces of chicken that melts in your mouth, this is a must have. The bihari boti and paratha were nothing to write home about as I have had better. Honestly, these two items were Charcoal's standard. Bland. But that handi and oh yes! the prawn starter totally nailed it! The prices are steep - 1 starter, 1 handi and 1 plate bihari kebab, 2 nans and 1 paratha, 1 large water bottle and 1 drink Rs. 2180. Steep as the quantity was exactly for 2 people (nothing was left over) which means that it is expensive and less quantity (1000 per head) Having said that, if you have plans for phase 8, this is where u wanna go.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-31T19:45:34+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-01T09:26:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"828190023","name":"Shaheen Nouman"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQxNDk1NjI1","before":"ODI4MTkwMDIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"389951377722685","from":{"name":"Lubna Ashraf Jafri","id":"501447368"},"message":"Wow, sounds like someone had a great experience at both the places and is satiated :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-31T22:23:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"389951684389321","from":{"name":"Lubna Ashraf Jafri","id":"501447368"},"message":"I love both TF and Kolachi too :)\nTF gotta be my favorite place for froyo these days!

And i like mine well done so i made sure to tell him many times that it HAS to be well done, and thankfully it was. Juicy, flavorful and well done. My steak was just great. Loved the ambience, the food and even the music. I found their music collection to be quite up to date and nice. A combination of latest english, hindi AND pakistani tracks.

Starters - Hot & Sour Soup - was liked by all 4 of us but it was a bit too sour, would taste even better if the vinegar is put on hold, Wasabi Prawns - 4 decent sized prawns fried and coated in wasabi/creamy white sauce served luke warm and Crab Rangoon - creamy crab meat wontons served cold - 6/10 for starters.  Main courses, Mu Shu Chicken - DIY paper thin pancakes served separately with chicken qeema and a black sauce - very desi stuff, Kung Pao Chicken - chunks of boneless chicken in red sauce with veggies and cashew nuts which were liked by all, Beef Steak - chunks of beef with veggies in black sauce, again liked by all, egg fried rice and chicken chowmein (very salty with excessive use of soy sauce with hardly any chicken meat in it) - 7/10 for main courses.

While I concede that AAM requires no defending from me, I feel obligated to point out that a parenthetical \"no offense\" hardly mitigates your dismissiveness of his earlier opinions.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-16T03:22:00+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"622773736","name":"Muffasar Malik","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14},{"id":"840619510","name":"Abid Aziz Merchant","type":"user","offset":158,"length":18}]},{"id":"380084035376086","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Sorry while abid is entitled to his fair opinion.

Will I wait for 1.5 hours for a meal, I realised having been to half a doz new restaurants on that strip that new places need time to get their act together. Al-Habib opened four months ago and still to improve their service and quality. Orders mixed up and inordinate delays in service are common. As compared to that Sajjad has consistency in quality of food but they too take a life time to serve their food  and need to improve on that, seems they have a shortage of staff or the line supervisors are not managing them properly.As compared to that Kababeesh's food and quality was prompt and attentive and the staff was trained to respond to their customer needs, but because it is at the end, it is not getting the attention it deserves.Ambala was another place which is quite good but needs to improve their service as the staff is uncontrolled and needs to be reminded that as a customer I demand good service quality. I have not heard any review on olive tree, some on Charcoal grill, but just that the food is average and ambiance is good.
