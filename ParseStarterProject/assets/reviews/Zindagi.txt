Loved the ambience and the service. Ordered Terragon Chicken and Creme Brule Latte. Chef Mehboob Mandokhel's photo on the menu came as a surprise. Was his co-host in the Morning Show Zauq Zindagi on ARY Zauq for a year but never knew he was a consultant for the franchise in Pakistan. Anyway back to the food. The presentation was a tad bland but the chicken sauce and the mashed potatoes tasted really good. The meat was cooked to perfection too. The potatoes in the side vegetables were undercooked but they were still edible. The latte was delicious. It had a little white heart in the froth. Got too engrossed in the book that I was reading, thought of taking the photo when it had settled down. The manager listened to my comments intently and even offered to get the Latte packed and warmed again so that I could sip it while I shopped around the mall. Will definitely visit again.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-22T12:15:44+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-22T17:21:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001011410786","name":"Shaban Ali Nagri"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"748503584","name":"Raheel Rehan"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"1091359728","name":"Anila Noman"},{"id":"524665437","name":"Saher Najam"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"},{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"520115164","name":"M Usman Khaled"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"533447656","name":"Saniea Akhtar"},{"id":"100001168391937","name":"Ramsha Nadeem"},{"id":"100000238497030","name":"Madiiha N Narrejo"},{"id":"703935487","name":"Xoya Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzAzOTM1NDg3","before":"MTAwMDAxMDExNDEwNzg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"622715684446252","from":{"name":"Saniea Akhtar","id":"533447656"},"message":"Love what ur reading. :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-22T13:07:26+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"622722707778883","from":{"name":"Mansoor Ahmed","id":"1172956793"},"message":"The Cuckoo's Calling at Gloria Jean's, interesting ;-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-22T13:36:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"622742694443551","from":{"name":"Rabiyah Tungekar","id":"516995421"},"message":"Creme Brulee at GJC is my fav!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-22T14:40:30+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"622750927776061","from":{"name":"Barooj Sohail","id":"1388400217"},"message":"This new JK Rowling novel, is it any good??","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-22T15:00:03+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"622773051107182","from":{"name":"Mona Liza","id":"616725751"},"message":"^ It's tooo descriptive -_-","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-22T16:00:27+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"622794411105046","from":{"name":"Summiyah Malik","id":"882410410"},"message":"Haha somehow swotties r more attracted to the book than food.
