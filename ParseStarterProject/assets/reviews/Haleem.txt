In case you're wondering, I did not just go to a restaurant in Karachi. So I can't really share my experience at one of these that are discussed here.\n\nBut what i will tell you is that I have lived in Karachi for most of my life (well, until I decided to go study engineering at NUST Islamabad). Even more than the lights and the life Karachi resonates with, what I miss the most is food... OUR Food. From the \"ami kay hath ki pakai hwe bhujya\" and Bun Kabab Stalls at Tariq Road to Kolachi at the rocks, every bite has had a special taste to it- one that is simply absent from the food that I eat here.\n\nPlease don't misunderstand me. Islamabad has some amazing restaurants. Chai khaana and Kitchen Cuisine, for instance, are worth a try. But the taste, the mix, the presentation and everything else is something we Karachiites can never settle for.\n\nEveryday, I stare down at food that lacks in spices, add-on veggies, and often in cooking too. After all, the hostel dining hall has to cater to students from all over the country. From what I have inferred, the spice intake generally decreases as you go \"up\" the country.\n\n The Haleem on Saturdays is nowhere near to the one you guys can eat at Burns Road. You would not believe that what I get on Thursdays is Biryani if you've have had a plate at any of the dhabbas or even your own place. The Qorma here? Oh boy if only they would use Shaan Masalas for that.\n\nYou know, I have kind of given up on the restaurants here too (seriously, how can anyone manage to eat  Afghani Burger?) What I now look most forward to is the monthly courier parcel my mom sends me. Yesterday I opened December to find packets of shami kababs, home made spaghetti, and chicken wings ^__^\n\nKarachi is under fire. Karachi is at War. Karachi probably needs a batman . But trust me, you guys still get damn good food to eat. I lost like 6 kg in my first 3 months here. Still haven't managed to recover all of that.\n\nBe grateful for the food you eat;love Karachi for it.\n\nStay safe \u003c3","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-09T20:55:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-10T19:26:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"807153988","name":"Huma Hussan"},{"id":"698480213","name":"Faiza Shafiq"},{"id":"100002459812246","name":"Mumtaz Begum Tejani"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"537798684","name":"Abdul Basit Memon"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"697750147","name":"Mohammad Ismail Asif"},{"id":"672626621","name":"Asad Baig"},{"id":"753624574","name":"Shazmeen Raza"},{"id":"100001993284398","name":"Rumaisa Nasir"},{"id":"650649934","name":"Ashnaa F Khan"},{"id":"564445611","name":"Shahbaz Ali Shueb"},{"id":"100002861468579","name":"Javeria Talal"},{"id":"100006019808344","name":"Anum Ellahi"},{"id":"552958742","name":"Amir Arfeen"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"100001408655261","name":"Faizan Kamran"},{"id":"864385150","name":"Faiz Khalil Shaikh"},{"id":"513198695","name":"Madiha Shiekh"},{"id":"655137222","name":"Hufsa Rizwan"},{"id":"781150340","name":"Huma Baqir"},{"id":"100006538473120","name":"Ali Shujaat"},{"id":"649725153","name":"Ateeb Akber"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ5NzI1MTUz","before":"ODA3MTUzOTg4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_664275373623616/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjQ5NzI1MTUz"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"664372816947205","from":{"name":"Faiz Rahila","id":"681048718"},"message":"Very well said Hassan.

Usually avoid going to the fancy restaurants offering desi cuisine because let's face it, we all love the roadside food regardless of its hygienic value. Anyhow, this place has really come out as a surprise ! Our order included the following:\n- Nihari\n- Biryani\n- Haleem\nThe Nihari is an absolute treat for the taste buds considering I personally am not a huge fam of Nihari. Desi makes its Nihari in Yakhni and it is the sort that you don't barf all day after having some. The quantity was good enough for 5 of us. It's slightly less thicker than we usually have everywhere else. The one DESI offers is light and tastes exceptionally good as compared to other Nihari walas around. Highly recommended !\n\nDesi's Biryani is something that I have not skipped in the last two visits to this place. Those who have tried it know it very well so won't go into the details. Great quantity and taste. Easily the best offered among other competing restaurants.\n\nThe Haleem *sigh*. I thought I'd never have Haleem anytime during the year except the Moharram season, but this was exquisite.

Not doughy/chewy, instead melted in the mouth. Beef was perfectly stir fried, succulent and v tender. Order time was apparently 1.5 hrs but was delivered in 50 mins.

I even loved their weird sweet pumpkin dessert.\n\nToday was no exception for the 7 of us - since the 8th one forgot to RSVP (which by the way means you are getting NO more invites from me) - debated between CHINA KITCHEN or FUCHSIA (ok I put up the debate everyone else was unanimous) - short story long we landed up at FUCHSIA.\n\nI arrived a few minutes late to find my friends seated comfortably, half had ordered and one was enjoying a fluorescent blue drink - something margarita. \n\nThe order was taken by a very competent Irfan. Loved his smiling face and courteous nature, also when he conspiratorially told me on a few orders \"madam order two,  one will be too little\" I knew he was our perfect host for the evening......he had understood here are the eaters. SWOT gatherings are dry....we concentrate only on the food and its quality.\n\nWhat all did we order:-\n1) clear Tom yum soup with seafood,\n2) the cloudy Tom  yum \n3) the coconut cream based Tom yum gha soup \n4) papaya salad without prawns (hence chicken)\n5) papaya salad normal\n6) soya beef (oh god in wish I had order one for each)\n7) Thai prawn cakes.\n8) beef in oyster sauce,\n9) dry beef chilie (divine)\n10) wok fried prawns \n11) chicken red curry\n12) spicy Pad Thai noodles,\n13) stir fry glass noodles,\n14) chocolate mousse (3)\n15) fried chocolate wontons with green tea ice cream (2)\n16) iced Thai tea \n17) fuchsia coloured pi?a colada\n18) orange juice (only thing disappointing on the order)\n19) cold drinks\n20) green tea.\n\nHOLY SWOT......did the 7 of us seriously order and eat all this food. WOW WE ARE PAITOOS.\n\nit was an unprecedentedly a great evening. Loved every morsel of what we ate. I will love the left overs for naashta, since I  scraped all the sauces from all the curries and dishes in to one - like a Thai Haleem. \n\nToday I discovered that I am a little low on some vitamins - after this meal the vitamin C from the birds eye will cover all that.\n\nTeam Aylanto - this is e best thing you could have done for Karachi. \n\nOne point - it's amazing that the best chocolate mousse in town is served at a Thai restaurant.
