(My dad is an ultimate nakhray wale uncle:p like the one who calls a steak gosht ka tukda, a pizza 'roti utay boti' and so on) so I always opt for desi with dad since he tends to be very particular with expense directly proportional to taste! Went for an early dinner to Khanji and were seated immediately (1. the weather was lovely, I loved how I ate desi with those back support chairs I could sink into after a long tedious day). Moving to the menu, really extensive, efficiently put together... Ordered Mutton Peshaweri Karhai, Shish Taouk...on asking about the serving we were told there would be 6 pieces so we order yet another 2 items (we dint know they wudnt be tiny pieces, instead king kong pieces) ordered fish tikka and Namkeen Boti. Dad was disappointed for no tandoori roti and only having chapati as an option! Waiter immediately said they can get from another eatery and so we ordered both\nPumpkin Meetha(I don't eat pumpkins, cant say much :))\nThe POST MORTEM:\nMutton Peshaweri Karhai: Nothing like those al habib or Kolachi tastes! Distinct flavors, loved how tender the meat was (I do not eat mutton apart from home but i surprisingly did!). Maybe the right tinge of Peshawer 10/10\n\nNamkeem Boti: I thought they'd be somehow salty (Namkeem wohi hota hai na?) But I think well marinated Chicken with an unbelievably managed execution, 10/10\n\nShish Taouk: A different version of Malai Boti, perhaps with some arabic spices maybe? (y m i being a chef? lol I'd rate it 8/10)\n\nFarmaishi Chapatti : Loved it, literally chapati had some peshaweri khan baba ki rooh in it maybe? The tandoori rotiz kept sadofying while we had our hands onto the chapati\n\nFish Tikka: Uff...Uff...Uff... I've never had fish as yummy (the desi way, after my mom making the bengali fish with Daal chawal since shez from Dhakka). I literally kept some space so i have a piece in the end and the taste remains while I m driven back home.\n\nTashweeshnaak discovery: All these dishes were in really huge proportions, good salad veges as accompaniments and yes, some creamy 'IRANI' sauce is served with all BBQ items which is somewhat raita and cheese ki sauce as well as i could distinguish the flavors!\n\nFinal Verdict: Highly recommended, get over BBQ tonight or family dawats at do darya, Khanji should just begin delivering, tabaahi hogi:D\nThe bill shows how its pocket friendly too, thats the total for Me,Mom & Dad (3 People)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-12T09:19:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-14T08:36:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000827449826","name":"Shahid Ali"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100006083859539","name":"Muhammad Amir"},{"id":"1377186173","name":"Owais Mahmood"},{"id":"508081630","name":"Maha Anwar"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"1130515361","name":"Sanwal Kazi"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"100002218273783","name":"Sana Nabi"},{"id":"709896077","name":"Asma Asghar"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"1432893682","name":"Shahid Zamir Shaikh"},{"id":"1158113319","name":"Fauzia Gul Durrani-Agha"},{"id":"560380437","name":"Arsalan Siddique"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"616725751","name":"Mona Liza"},{"id":"100003303131853","name":"Samad Fansia"},{"id":"100002505633547","name":"Umme Kulsoom Khalid Ahmed"},{"id":"1574269235","name":"Sehar Fahim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTU3NDI2OTIzNQ\u003d\u003d","before":"MTAwMDAwODI3NDQ5ODI2"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_632543486796805/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTU3NDI2OTIzNQ%3D%3D"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"632545416796612","from":{"name":"Whack Attack","id":"715820863"},"message":"where ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T09:23:58+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632548826796271","from":{"name":"Danish Saeed","id":"591051922"},"message":"leave the food.. i've started liking the way u write reviews.good one girl... specially the terminology..\"TASHWEESHNAAK DISCOVERY\"","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T09:34:44+0000","like_count":18,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632549150129572","from":{"name":"Whack Attack","id":"715820863"},"message":"and it looks that the serving is very clean !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T09:36:09+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632549613462859","from":{"name":"Kashan Hanif","id":"786239734"},"message":"^PortGrand","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T09:37:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632550806796073","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"My faaaaaaavorite place!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T09:42:28+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632563066794847","from":{"name":"Obaid Haroon","id":"100000069136891"},"message":"Add Plz Plz.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T10:20:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632568473460973","from":{"name":"Uzma Arif","id":"589340712"},"message":"Aaquib Arif","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T10:36:20+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"632595343458286","from":{"name":"Akber Ali Khaliqdina","id":"511168242"},"message":"based on nicely expressed review... yes must visit now :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T11:05:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632595743458246","from":{"name":"Talha Shahid","id":"668642026"},"message":"Soha: I'm in love with your father :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T11:07:17+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632605600123927","from":{"name":"Sobya Tabish","id":"516131322"},"message":"How was sheesh taouk?

Ribs, Afghani, Reshmi and Satay with 3 varieties of naan, raita, chutney, bbq sauce, satay sauce, juices, drinks and water and 5 people eating so much gosht and paying 600/- per head inclusive of over 10% paid as tip is great value for money in these days of so much mehangai.

However, the waiter there was courteous enough to request recounting in my presence as he felt the cash was less than the billed amount. Dealt in a courteous way, both parties realized that it was just a human error on his part. I believe such restaurants can safely assume that their customers will be respectable enough to not do such lowly stuff as paying less cash.

When people started being negative about Aylanto, I wanted to give them another chance to see if it was really that bad now. Our first experience at the new place was a C+ so I could not understand the horrible reviews they were getting. So, being a glutton for punishment, I took Mariyam Masood there for lunch today. Sigh, what can I say that it was a complete and utter disappointment! First, the positives. Good greeting at the door, polite waiters, cold water, fresh bread and courteous damage control. Unfortunately that is where it stops! Ordered the French Onion soup which actually was not too bad the last time but microscopic cheese on two pieces of french bread thrown in at the last minute so they were hard. When I sent it back, because at the time of the order I specified that I wanted it to be smothered in melting cheese, it returned with some additional grated but unmelted cheese. Strike One! Mariyam's Tarragon Chicken, which she loved at the old Aylanto, was two skinny pieces of chicken unable to really remain juicy or retain flavour. Strike Two! My steak was ordered medium rare and came medium well. Was replaced with one that was more like medium but by then I did not want to waste any more time or food and dutifully ate the average tasting steak. Strike Three! To their credit, one of their managers came to check when he had been told I was unhappy with our food and I shared my concerns with him. He was very apologetic and despite my repeated requests to the contrary, removed the soup and steak from the bill ... which made me very uncomfortable since that was not my intent in speaking with him. I told him that they really need to focus on their food if they are to stem the negative tide and he was receptive to the feedback. He requested that we return and he would personally take charge of our orders. However, unfortunately that is not what we want from any restaurant. Sure, people do take care of us at places we go to but then that is in their nature for ALL their customers, not just us. Overall, being a charitable person, I hope that they can return to the standards of yesteryear because at the moment, I find it very hard to point myself in the direction of Aylanto again. And that is a damn shame since I did enjoy my occasional visits there. The top management and owners have to take charge and do something because even a blind guy like me can see the problems screaming at me! Sorry Aylanto, I really am. I wanted to be positive and see hope but since things are sliding since my last visit, there is genuine cause for concern.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-04T10:18:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-04T18:07:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"603103229","name":"Danish Munir"},{"id":"698366264","name":"Ahsan R.

Sigh, what can I say that it was a complete and utter disappointment! First, the positives. Good greeting at the door, polite waiters, cold water, fresh bread and courteous damage control. Unfortunately that is where it stops! Ordered the French Onion soup which actually was not too bad the last time but microscopic cheese on two pieces of french bread thrown in at the last minute so they were hard. When I sent it back, because at the time of the order I specified that I wanted it to be smothered in melting cheese, it returned with some additional grated but unmelted cheese. Strike One! Mariyam's Tarragon Chicken, which she loved at the old Aylanto, was two skinny pieces of chicken unable to really remain juicy or retain flavour. Strike Two! My steak was ordered medium rare and came medium well. Was replaced with one that was more like medium but by then I did not want to waste any more time or food and dutifully ate the average tasting steak. Strike Three! To their credit, one of their managers came to check when he had been told I was unhappy with our food and I shared my concerns with him. He was very apologetic and despite my repeated requests to the contrary, removed the soup and steak from the bill ... which made me very uncomfortable since that was not my intent in speaking with him. I told him that they really need to focus on their food if they are to stem the negative tide and he was receptive to the feedback. He requested that we return and he would personally take charge of our orders. However, unfortunately that is not what we want from any restaurant. Sure, people do take care of us at places we go to but then that is in their nature for ALL their customers, not just us. Overall, being a charitable person, I hope that they can return to the standards of yesteryear because at the moment, I find it very hard to point myself in the direction of Aylanto again. And that is a damn shame since I did enjoy my occasional visits there. The top management and owners have to take charge and do something because even a blind guy like me can see the problems screaming at me! Sorry Aylanto, I really am. I wanted to be positive and see hope but since things are sliding since my last visit, there is genuine cause for concern.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-04T10:18:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-04T18:07:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"603103229","name":"Danish Munir"},{"id":"698366264","name":"Ahsan R.
