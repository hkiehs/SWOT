So it was my best friend Bisma's birthday celebration today so my friends and I went on a 'eating spree' you could say today and thus, I will write the reviews for all the places we went to and the things we ate.\nThe first place was McDonald's :p amazing caramel shake! One large shake between 4 girls. Hehe. And fries are always good. Then we went to Dolmen ka Gloria Jeans. We ordered the Aussie cheese fries and a mixed berry chiller. Both were, in my friend's words, outstanding. The cheese fries at Gloria's are the best! \nNext, Golden Dragon. We ordered the lunch box deal for one with egg fried rice and Szechuan chicken, though I personally insisted on the dinner deal which has 2 drumsticks as well (for lunch, I might add) and even though they said it was not possible, Qamarunisa is such a sweetheart that we spoke to her and she made it happen. Love her for that because we got drumsticks (that i was desperate for cuz they are so yummy). So overall drumsticks, Szechuan, rice, everything was divine as usual. Lastly, Grub. From what I can tell, this place is highly underrated and has amazing food so I think it deserves a good review. We ordered Grub Mush burgers, one pepperoni pizza, and their chocolate cake. The burger was huge and yummy as usual. It was the first time for all of us in ordering the pizza. It was quite yummy, cheesy and filling.

Over the years I had grown quite fond of the place and would count myself as one of its regulars. I am most sorry to admit that after last nights meal I nor any of the 12 guests I was with, will ever visit there again. We were served by our usual waiter, a chap that I am very nervous around due to the fact that on a previous occasion he accidentally poured an entire glass of iced mint lemonade down my back, an incident I chose to overlook at the time and continued to dine at the restaurant. However this evening, aside from the continuous knocks I would receive on my chair by the clumsy waiter, all seemed to be going well. That was until we were served dessert and coffee accompanied ( in our utter shock) by our 14th uninvited guest, a COCKROACH!!! Not the small freshly hatched kind but the medium sized teenaged rebel that seemed just as shocked to see us. It made its way out of the sugar bowl and decided to take a brisk walk around the table. It was apprehended by one of my guests who used a plate to put it down. Although he laughed it off to ease the embarrassment that was by now clearly apparent on my face, the utter disgust at what had just happened could not be camouflaged. I should have gotten up and left immediately whilst at the same time creating a huge hue and cry to make sure every single person at the restaurant would realise what had just happened. I did not do that. Against my better judgement I chose to give the restaurant a chance. The manager gave me the usual excuses, one involved the fact that there was a tree in the middle of the restaurant, as if that insignificant piece of information was somehow supposed to make me feel better. I was even more shocked that I was presented with the bill shortly afterwards. I decided to speak to the owners of the restaurant, I refused to believe they were made aware of the situation and that I was now being treated in this manner. The manager of course would not let me speak to the owner, I was given the customary excuse that his phone was off. So I made a call, got the number and called myself. Lo and behold! I got through by the third ring. After calmly explaining the situation and receiving many apologies by the owner I was still presented with the bill! This time however it was reduced by comping us the 4 coffees we had ordered and removing the tax! ( a kacha bill so to speak!!!) I was dumbfounded to say the least! I thought I would have been better off raising a ruckus and embarrassing the restaurant which was by now receiving its next party. I again messaged the owner asking him if I was really expected to pay this bill. When he replied that I should, I had decided that was it for me. I paid the bill and left quietly. I decided to wait till today to write this, because I did not want to ramble on in anger. I think that more then the disgust and shock at what happened I am saddened that even at a restaurant like Pompeii there is no accountability. I'm certain the restaurateur would have dined abroad and is quite aware of how matters such as these are dealt with, but as usual even the educated lot believe that in Pakistan, \"sub kuch chalta hai\". This \"let it all hang out\" attitude has gotten us to where we are today. We see it everywhere, everyday! It was silly of me to expect anything different here. \n\nIt is shameful. I am sure this incident will make no difference to the owners, they got paid and that's all that counts! A few apologies and a kacha bill later this will be forgotten. A fact that the owner was probably well aware of, he is well educated!  ( in the system, the lawlessness and the superficiality of this country) Hats off to him! He made his sale. Chaching!!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-18T10:28:20+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-19T11:54:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"711699788","name":"Sanaa Zubairi"},{"id":"1668177824","name":"Omer Salimullah"},{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid"},{"id":"665690478","name":"Hassan Nadeem"},{"id":"100002505633547","name":"Umme Kulsoom Khalid Ahmed"},{"id":"1433484222","name":"Misha Dyer"},{"id":"574052713","name":"Harun Aziz"},{"id":"509630499","name":"Shahzeen Shahid Siddiqui"},{"id":"100002154180249","name":"Afifa J Maniar"},{"id":"669320704","name":"Fahad Azad"},{"id":"100001464218778","name":"Narmeen Nadir Fazwani"},{"id":"1035196445","name":"Anusha Ahmed"},{"id":"100005306882506","name":"Anisa Ahmed"},{"id":"553350590","name":"Faizan Chaghtai"},{"id":"518198693","name":"Samreen Faizan"},{"id":"1346560868","name":"Hira Javed Saya"},{"id":"1491861746","name":"Hamza Arshad Faruqui"},{"id":"640698568","name":"Pervez Sadiq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQwNjk4NTY4","before":"NzExNjk5Nzg4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"636215859762901","from":{"name":"Umtus Sanna Hussain-Mirza","id":"528525436"},"message":"well u knowwww whatb they say about 13 people at the table right? downright bad luck!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-18T12:09:40+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false},{"id":"636215986429555","from":{"name":"Umtus Sanna Hussain-Mirza","id":"528525436"},"message":"but seriously...OMG how terribleee!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-18T12:09:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"636217133096107","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Agreeable that a cockroach is a nasty visitor at a dinner table my question is what put you off more?

All the people saying that only the portion of the meal where the roach emerged should have been compensated, my question to you is.... 'are you oblivious to the fact that the dessert and coffee was made in the same kitchen and facility as the rest of the meal was?' There is no such thing as a 'dessert exclusive roach'! Roaches, if there are any, will roam freely all over the kitchen and find nooks, corners, crevices and the slightest hint of a crumb to crawl all over the place. A roach is symptomatic of a larger issue at hand, one that pertains to sanitation and hygiene. A higher-end dining place like Pompeii, that would've charged around PKR25,000 to PKR30,000 for that table of thirteen is expected to adhere to the strictest standards of cleanliness and pest-control measures. For the manager to cite the presence of a tree in the middle of a restaurant or for him to deny telephonic access to the owner of the restaurant reeks of irresponsible behavior. Also, how does abolishing the sales tax make sense to anyone? If a customer is being charged, even if it is a reduced bill, how does the waiver of the sales tax become legitimate? It is actually a violation of FBR regulations! The reason why this customer is horrified is because he was already in shock with the presence of a roach on his table (where he had invited his guests and was willing to dole out his hard-earned money to treat them to a great dining experience) and the addition of a bill in that particular circumstance must have come across as ludicrously insane! Even if the party of 13 had enjoyed their earlier courses, the point is that the entire dining experience was spoiled and people were left wondering what other morsels of theirs had those roaches crawled over in the kitchen. With that kind of thought playing on one's mind, and with disgust adorning the faces of an entire party of 13, the prospect of having to pay for that sort of a dining experience is just senseless and uncalled for! That meal should have never been charged for!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-18T14:02:27+0000","like_count":11,"user_likes":false},{"id":"636265136424640","from":{"name":"Uz Abbasi Husain","id":"706671594"},"message":"I agree!!

It is located right above Butler?s Chocolate Caf? on main Zamzama (where New York Caf? once was).\nRight from the entrance in the side lane to the restaurant itself, the management seems to have paid a good deal of attention to detail in the d?cor and have kept the place spotless (so far).\nWe ordered a bunch of things, but what really stood out were the ?Parmesan Crusted Chicken in Orange Sauce?, and their ?Seafood Salad?.\nWe were served complementary bite-sized appetizers, and an assortment of bread with sundried-tomato butter and garlic butter.  Although these were pretty good, but I?m still a fan of the bread they serve at Pompei Restaurant.\nThe chicken had 2 generously-sized juicy fillets that had been batter fried and topped with orange sauce. This combination of flavors made a perfect blend (unlike most people have been able to do with pretty much any dish that has an orange sauce). The dish is served with side of vegetables and gratin potatoes.\nThe Salad was extremely impressive on its own and is a great meal for any seafood lover who?s looking to eat something refreshing! It had an assortment of shrimps, calamari, lobster and scallops served with iceberg lettuce. This was a very substantially sized serving that seemed perfect for a healthy lunch, or a filling dinner if accompanied with a starter or desert.\nUnfortunately we were so full after this meal that there was no room to even think of ordering anything for desert (note for my next visit: order less in the appetizers and save space for desert) \nIt was disappointing to see the low turnout at this restaurant ?unlike most Zamzama eateries (even on weekdays). However I?m assuming one should make reservations if you plan on going on a weekend.\nWould highly recommend Sam?s Place for a quiet dinner (ironically right in the middle of Zamzama), or a bright and sunny lunch (the space has great big windows to let in loads of natural light in the day).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-20T07:05:35+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-20T13:28:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"882650316","name":"Sabah Shaikh"},{"id":"646760193","name":"Rehma Tirmizey"},{"id":"814525594","name":"Sohaib A Junaidi"},{"id":"505596876","name":"Samia Salman"},{"id":"591827743","name":"Tuba Arshad"},{"id":"515754753","name":"Hala Anjum Syed"},{"id":"505430448","name":"Nabeel Da"},{"id":"665006600","name":"Cyma Almakky"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY1MDA2NjAw","before":"ODgyNjUwMzE2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"621729241211563","from":{"name":"Zainab Abidi","id":"502297291"},"message":"Dude we wnet there and their service was painfully slow which ticked me off","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-20T07:08:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"621753764542444","from":{"name":"Amal Anis Makda","id":"542900496"},"message":"same here went there... ordered one of their mushroom steak... dont exactly remember the name of the entree'..Despite, being a  beef steak  it wasnt juicy as expected.There was a weird stinking smell in the beef like something had happened to their meat in the fridge.The flavor was bland and tasteless to the extent that i had pack the whole thing and give it to the beggar on way.All they had served was a huge chunk of beef in the plate with the same bizzare creame mushroom sauce on top of it..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-20T09:29:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"621828617868292","from":{"name":"Maryam Maqbool","id":"652495530"},"message":"Agreed Mikail.

We ordered #Pasta, #Pizza, #Spaghetti and #Steak; all 4 items were served on time, and tasted so yummy and were deliciously fulfilling. Later we also ordered #Tiramisu for dessert which was equally worth paying for ! \n\nAs hearing of a lot of service complains from all over, on Eid time, Pompei's was fast and friendly.

Wonderful food! Service was a bit slow and there were a few mess ups with the food ordered, but that is understandable seeing as it's Eid and they were probably short on staff :)\nFor starters we ordered a Tomato and Olives Bruschetta. We ordered one, but they gave us two orders :p well, that doesn't matter because we quite enjoyed the starter as it was quite lovely. The soup was ordered was Tomato Soup. It was absolutely divine and creamy and just plain yumm.\nThe main courses were Grilled Chicken with Tarragon Sauce, Grilled Chicken with Mushroom Risotto and Spicy Japanese Chicken. My own main was the Tarragon Chicken and I loved it. Though I do wish there was a little more tarragon sauce. Either way, the chicken was cooked to perfection, the sauce delicious, as were the accompanying saut?ed veggies and mashed potatoes. My mom's main was the chicken with mushroom risotto and she loved her dish, as did I. I love mushrooms and i love risotto and I've found that not many restaurants can put the two together and make it taste divine, by Olivetto and Gon Pacci really do make a really tasty mushroom risotto. I didn't get to try more than a bite of the Spicy Japanese Chicken, that too at the very end, but what I tasted was quite lovely and perfectly spiced.\nOur drinks were a Hazelnut Frappe and an Affogato. Both were perfectly sweet, cold and refreshing, as they were meant to be. All in all, a wonderful fine dining experience! Thank you Gon Pacci for a lovely night :D","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-10T19:39:09+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-10T20:16:25+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"698764443","name":"Shahnawaz Moti"},{"id":"504513463","name":"Fariha A Farooqui"},{"id":"100000087541003","name":"Sarah Iftikhar"},{"id":"813405111","name":"Moiz Ali P"},{"id":"100001132050300","name":"Noor Un Nisa Daudpota"},{"id":"1103653032","name":"Maha Raheel"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEwMzY1MzAzMg\u003d\u003d","before":"NTc1Mjc2NzUy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"601283709922783","from":{"name":"Marvi Shah","id":"522705412"},"message":"Oh and one more thing.

Also I heard Pompei the best steaks in Karachi but I don't know where they are and I heard a little pricy. Again, good luck!

Firstly, a customer's opinion is their right and that must be respected. However, as I have said numerous times, there must be some detail to why the opinion exists for it to be useful in a public forum like SWOT. Simply referring to price and talking about the concept of value for money isn't enough. Nor is an unsupported remark about service in a passing comment. And as Ali Tariq said, it is absolutely true that value for money varies wildly for each individual and that is how it should be.  However, frankly at 2400 per head, I don't think you can eat extraordinarily at Pompeii or Okra etc ... starters average around 4-500+, main courses range between 700 and 2400+, desserts and drinks on top of that ... add tax and tip, you are easily around the 3000 mark or more. Again, while respecting the right of people to have their opinion, I am just making the point that we all need to be responsible, clear and informative in conveying that opinion ... be it positive or negative ... statements without details dilute the value of the opinion for those of us who actually read them with interest. Finally, and this is my own personal thing, if I am happy with my dining experience, then that is value for money received ... however, as Merchant Abid said, even the I may find the restaurant too expensive to become a frequent customer and that is also fair enough!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-03T04:55:41+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"519505693","name":"Ali Tariq","type":"user","offset":481,"length":9},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid","type":"user","offset":1349,"length":13}]},{"id":"552473951470426","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"It's a pity your experience was not worthy of the money you spent.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-03T05:04:27+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTUyNDczOTUxNDcwNDI2","before":"NTUxMzkwNjgxNTc4NzUz"}}},"restaurantName":"Pompei"},{"id":"165861103465048_549340875117067","from":{"name":"Mariam Salman","id":"633700975"},"message":"Best pizza in town?????","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-28T12:44:19+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T16:13:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"503334589","name":"Ali Abbas Rashid"},{"id":"812680452","name":"Zohaib Javed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODEyNjgwNDUy","before":"NTAzMzM0NTg5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"549341508450337","from":{"name":"Ayesha Aziz Shaik","id":"515593365"},"message":"NewYork pizza","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T12:47:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549341815116973","from":{"name":"Rubina Habib","id":"865695264"},"message":"14th street","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T12:48:58+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549343065116848","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Xander's and Pompeii for eating on location","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T12:53:36+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549343138450174","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Dominos for delivery","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T12:53:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549343271783494","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"sorry Abid after the last and final experience I can't suggest your fav PIZZO.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T12:54:36+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549343615116793","from":{"name":"Mariam Salman","id":"633700975"},"message":"Thank u guys.

As an establishment that has to cater to the masses on one of the busiest days of the year, yet keep the consistency and serving times to the needs of the patrons. We have to take the best approach to serving and seating our guests. We do not necessarily pad the pricing of Valentine Day Set-menu?s; neither do we keep it a fully discounted deal. Most establishments notified in advance that there would be Set-menu?s with no Ala Carte available, the choice was still the patrons as whether to go or not. No establishment is perfect, we all make mistakes, and condemning us for a few small flaws occasionally is a bit extreme.\nAs put best by Lincoln ?You can please some of the people all of the time, you can please all of the people some of the time, but you can?t please all of the people all of the time?.\nWe appreciate all constructive criticism and never retaliate in a childlike manner to the ill-manners of patrons who do not follow the same guidelines that they so freely impose on us. It is very easy to come and vent your frustrations on an open forum without thinking of the consequences it has on others.

It is obviously in our best interest to provide high quality service, which is why keep a set menu. Its not as if we force anyone to take the menu, upon taking reservations, the menu is explained and the customers oblige. I will admit that we had some errors in service. In the middle our gas went to next to nothing for about half an hour (not using that as an excuse). Once a few orders back up, well its a lot like the domino effect during rush hour. It should be rather obvious that we have no intention of  providing bad service or giving anyone a less than perfect experience. If that was the case, then Im pretty sure then we're in the wrong industry. Iit was a rather overwhelming response that night and some issues did occur. That being said, being a restaurant we dont penalize guests when the make reservations for a certain time and casually walk in half an hour late. Sure, it makes life difficult for us - but hey thats what hospitality is all about to provide excellent service. If anyone has felt that they received any less then that, feel free to contact me so I may rectify the matter.

It all depends on ones point of view. Sharing ours at Cafe 76, we felt that to ensure that service is par excellence on a night where the attending guests expect impeccable service is provided nothing less or at least best efforts to come as close to that as possible. \n\nWith that intention in mind, we wanted to ensure that all prep was done in a timely fashion and that the entire team in engine room was ready for battle equipped with the right weapons. \n\nCustomers were notified in advance at the time of reservations about the set menu and the same was well advertised through all the food groups/pages as well as our own brand page. \n\nWe received a good response and customers were delighted by the choice available to them. In the case of any customer who wished not to have our selection of steak, they were offered another choice to cater to them. \n\nAs for our pricing, if you look at our menu prices and the total the offering through the set menu amounts to, there is a very slight float that ensures that we can provide a tailored setup (our lit tables, a DJ and lighting up the place in a red hue as well as to offer every lady guest who attended a long stem imported rose) to our guests on a special occasion to them. \n\nSo in summation, we felt our decision was a successful one especially subject to the personal feedback we received that night by all our patrons, old and new. \n\n:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-21T20:58:59+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"508560025861819","from":{"name":"Danyal Achria","id":"582960575"},"message":"For Valentines, The Patio decided to offer both, our full A la carte menu & a special Valentines set menu.

But being able to provide all our patrons with a diverse selection & also make sure all their favorite dishes were still available was pivotal; thus we decided to take the risk & the results were fantastic.                           Although we had maybe 1-2 minor issues during the whole night, we got over a 95% positive feedback from all guest who dinned with us that night & that was out of almost 40 Couples. Nezihe to answer your question, our primary reason to have a special set menu was to offer certain dishes which were not on our menu & would give our patrons something new to try. Also with a set menu, you can customize it for the particular day, thus for valentines we were able to offer Chocolate Fondue with fresh fruits, Grilled Lobster & our Red Snapper plus much more within the set menu. This also allowed us to get feedback on our new items & our patrons appreciated the fact we were offering something new & different just for that day; at the same time not limiting them just to the set menu.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-22T01:56:37+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe","type":"user","offset":767,"length":6}]},{"id":"508577875860034","from":{"name":"Kamran Afzal","id":"606892840"},"message":"That makes a lot of sense.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-22T03:10:06+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"508639909187164","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"That you all for your responses and feed-backs, glitches can and will happen on a regular basis, after all both the customer and the eateries are human.

However, I have been to Forty4 several times in small and large groups and at various times of the week / lunch / dinner. One of the most consistently noticeable comments from my friends has been to acknowledge the service in addition to the food quality, selection and value. That said, I am sure that there have been issues as Aman Virji has acknowledged. For the record, I would not hesitate to take groups of friends or professional colleagues to Forty4! One restaurant that remains unmentioned is Pompeii which should be in the running as they do meet all the same standards that Forty4 has for our dining experiences. Have not been to Thyme or The Patio so I cannot comment, although others have said good things about both places ... especially The Patio. Aylanto has disappointed us multiple times with respect to food and at our last visit, we actually left without eating due to issues with the attitude of the staff. For that reason, we have not been to Aylanto for many months now and therefore things could be very different by now so it is hard for me to offer anything more than our prior experiences while acknowledging the passage of time. Okra is not a place we have visited very often but many of our friends go there and I have never heard anything but glowing reports about the food with the only cautionary factors being the small size of the restaurant and sometimes the availability of reservations. Cafe Flo has its diehard fans or people like me who feel that it is nice enough but not among our first choices.

Perfect place to sit outside and have dinner. First rcvd the bread basked, the bread was okay but the chilli flvrd butter(or so i think it was, pretty good). Next came the mains for grilled jumbo prawns with risotto and pesto and shrimp pizza. Grilled prawns were great, pizza was good too(although i thought it would be some thing else), it was pesto instead of marinara sauce and shrimp, 2 kind of cheese with sun dried tomatoes and onion. I guess the experience was okay, not that good to get me through again.\nAfter that went to Berrylicious, had coconut and passion fruit with strawberry. Both were really great almost reminded me of Pinkberry in dxb. Both flavors were similiar to Pinkberry which made me think that is this the franchise of Pinkberry or did they make a really good copy of it?\n\nAlso went to friday to port grand and settled for charman mao, which was strictly average. Ordered bbq wings, manchurian chicken, dry beef with chilli and vegi rice. Everything was decent except beef, i couldnt taste the beef at all. Also went to dolmen city tariq road, went to chairman mao again with a friend as we had to go for dinner somewhere else, ordered crispy beef and prawn on toast. Crispy beef was bad, couldnt taste the beef at all + it was burnt.

Very very good. The Vietnamese roll was fresh, crunchy, peanuty, spicy and brilliant. The mango prawn salad. The birds eye chilli wafer thin slices hit the perfect high notes. \n\nMy chocolate steak.

The chilli garlic prawn was exactly how it sounded, safe and boring, I ordered it in case all else failed with the starters..I had to search around for the prawns..wasn't too impressed with the portions. I went straight into the main course from there which in my case was the beef tenderloin with dark cocoa balsamic reduction in tarragon..was happy to see some one finallyyyyy taking risks and getting adventurous with steaks, preparing them in a different way. I really liked it, although was a bit peeved by the fact that I specifically asked for medium well and what was served was welldone. This is always a problem with restaurants they just can't seem to get it right, my friend ordered te beef tenderloin in Chardonnay..in his case the beef was cooked perfectly but I wasn't too excited about the sauce. I happened to try the angel hair pasta with mussels, scallops and squid. I have to say this dish was prepared very well, it was light and the favors blended perfectly, I would go back there for this dish in particular. The dessert I ordered was the chocolate fondant, was impressed by the very thin film of cake around the lava, something which is missing in the one at pompei which actually feels like a solid sponge cake another thing that was lacking was the burnt caramel ice cream that u get at Pompei. Did not like the vanilla dollop on the side which if I'm not mistaken was not made in the kitchen but most likely bought from the market. \n\nThe service: aahh the service, I'm guessing it would have been better if the majority of the waitier force was not at Adnans table..sorry dude but they were :) ..I happened to get a table in the non smoking section. BAD idea!! Everytime the kitchen door swung open it was like a bar fight in there! Not a pleasant experience! I think I had to wait way too long for my meal, I got there at 935 left at 1145. Had to get the waiters attention more then once. \nAll in all Id have to say I did enjoy the food I ordered, and the fact that it was nice to see someone taking risks with the way food is ordinarily prepared in most restaurants.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T20:19:38+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"395859890465167","from":{"name":"Omar Omari","id":"508277151"},"message":"I apologize if my review was erratic and all over the place, but i am kinda sleepy","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T20:21:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"395864000464756","from":{"name":"Omar Omari","id":"508277151"},"message":"The 44 house pasta was extremely rich..I was floored with one mouthful..heavy stuff but I agree, was flavorful","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T20:29:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"395900820461074","from":{"name":"Omar Omari","id":"508277151"},"message":"True say..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T21:46:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"395902853794204","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"whether fore warned or not - its proves that they can serve that level - so why not to every customer - i am not talking about just 44 here - but generally - why do patrons have to drop names of owners or now  food pages to get decent service - why not everyone who is walking in and going to pay for the the food in front of them","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T21:51:10+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"396090333775456","from":{"name":"Sohail Maskatiya","id":"738981577"},"message":"A brief description of the 44 house pasta would be appreciated.

However,  I'm sorry to say adnan had 1 server, and I know this as I was dining at the table right next to him. Nonetheless, it is no excuse for feeling neglected. As for the dishes, if they were not to your liking, you could have always returned them and tried something else. Its always unfortunate when you pay for a meal and don't feel even partially satisfied. However, if there is something which tickles ur palete, do let me know and ill try and make it for you.

Rolls, Seafood, Ice Cream, Fast Food, BBQ - every restaurant is a jack of all trades. The customer is left confused, and the message as to what's \"good\" is usually distorted.  I have yet to order Golden Dragon or BOTS (not picking on either of you, but just pointing out my indecisiveness) because I have no idea what their best foot forward is. \n\nMy two cents for the day: \nRestaurants should offer less items and focus more on \"quality\" products. At the end of the day- the cost of maintenance, margin for disappointment, and overall efficiency are improved drastically.  If you can't do that, at least have a \"Chef's Recommendation\".  Your client?le will not grow because you suddenly offer a Garlic Mayo Roll, or you started serving Ice Cream.\n\nIf your a Chinese restaurant and your Sweet and Sour Chicken is subpar, please don't offer it for the sake of offering it.  If your a Bakery, and you know burgers are not your forte, please don't risk disappointing the customer.  If you sell Rolls, and for some God forsaken reason you feel like selling me Shakes- at least make sure your product stands out in some perceivable way.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-31T07:26:13+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-31T18:13:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"732705760","name":"Nishat Aleem Khan"},{"id":"544715226","name":"Sairah Khalid"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"511301771","name":"Eefa Khalid"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA4ODc0NDI2NQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NzMyNzA1NzYw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"389549797762843","from":{"name":"Waqas Tariq","id":"1088744265"},"message":"Agreed, happens to me every-time I order from my fav joints.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-31T07:37:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"389550061096150","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"ahsan: i totally understand where ur coming from.

Called them on Friday to make a reservation for Sunday and they informed me that the only available time slots were for 8 pm or 11 pm, which I declined. My sister in law called a few minutes later and was told the same - she, however, went on to inform them that she is well aware of their marketing gimmicks (of being supposedly overbooked), which resulted in them promptly giving her a reservation for 8:30. On Saturday night, she received a call from Pompei asking why her party of ten hadn't shown up yet. When she explained that her reservation had been made for Sunday and not Saturday, they insisted she had mentioned the wrong day/date while making the booking (all witnesses swear she said Sunday :)). Needless to say, they didn't budge and we had to change the venue (and disappoint our guests) at the last minute.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-22T11:05:58+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-22T17:19:37+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"723007812","name":"Ronny Byramji"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzIzMDA3ODEy","before":"NzIzMDA3ODEy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"384200628297760","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"to err is human.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-22T16:07:49+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"384237298294093","from":{"name":"Imran Aziz Bandukda","id":"1359388024"},"message":"Sorry for your trouble, will look into this apparently unsuccessful \"marketing gimmick\" tomorrow :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-22T17:19:37+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzg0MjM3Mjk4Mjk0MDkz","before":"Mzg0MjAwNjI4Mjk3NzYw"}}},"restaurantName":"Pompei"},{"id":"165861103465048_382953701755786","from":{"name":"Ziad Bashir","id":"791715789"},"message":"Went for lunch to Xander's today with friends and kids ?.. when I got there one of the waiters took down my name and said that a table inside would be approx 5-10mins.  Surely enough five minutes later we were seated inside and quickly placed the order.  We ordered three types of Pizza's to start with ? the margarita, pesto with anchovies, and the chicken and jalape?o.  Also for the starters we ordered the fried calamari with scallion and garlic plus the honey glazed wings.  Though the service was good on the whole I had to remind them three times in ten minutes to bring the water which was a tad bit irritating.  Apart from this little glitch service has vastly improved?.The pizza's arrived promptly?the first the margarita was good but not great, the same with the second the chicken jalape?o it was good but not something which one would say hit the spot.  The third the pesto with anchovies I will be bold enough to say flavor wise was the best pizza I have eaten in Karachi period.  I say flavor wise because the toppings were a perfect \"10\" but the base in all three pizza's was a bit limp I prefer my base to be a bit crispy so not to droop in half when picked up from the plate.  That said if they can quickly fix this easily addressable problem they will definitely give the Pompei pizza a run for its money!!!  The fried calamari and the honey glazed wings arrived next.  Both were excellent !!! The garlic and scallions were perfectly balanced with the fried calamari as not to over power the taste and this dish was truly a pleasure to eat and the wings were also simply brilliant.  For mains we ordered the jalape?o cheese burger, the sliders, scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, and penne pasta with chicken and alfredo sauce.  I didn't have the scrambled eggs but my friend who did said they were excellent.  The jalape?o cheese burger was good but not as great as the sliders ?especially the blue cheese one?..it was really super!!!  My daughter loved the penne pasta and said it is as good as any she has had ?? just as we had finished devouring are meal Sikander show up with a new dish he was sampling and asked if we would like to try it, we loved it but don't know if I should mention it as he is still working on it?.  He is really a passionate restauranteur who loves experimenting with new dishes and we are really lucky to have him in Karachi ?we can expect many new culinary delights from him in the years to come!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-20T17:07:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-20T17:07:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"100000374500079","name":"Misbah Nizami"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"1340157842","name":"Naheed Mashooqullah"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM0MDE1Nzg0Mg\u003d\u003d","before":"ODQ2NjY0NTM4"}}},"restaurantName":"Pompei"},{"id":"165861103465048_380927505291739","from":{"name":"Bilal Habib","id":"728038934"},"message":"went to pompei last night and all i can say is that Pompei is the ONLY place for steak, absolutely fabulous meat and cooked to perfection. infact everything was just simply brilliant. pompei has the best combo of food and ambiance. welldone guys","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-17T12:16:46+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-18T08:57:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575532628","name":"Sa'ni Moten"},{"id":"783794861","name":"Ayesha Oosman"},{"id":"100000374500079","name":"Misbah Nizami"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ1NjIwMTMz","before":"NTc1NTMyNjI4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"380958171955339","from":{"name":"Adeel Mansha","id":"790360178"},"message":"usually i would agree with steak and pompeii being 9/10 or above but for some odd reason I havent had the best of experiences with steak there in the last 2 visits!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T13:27:58+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"380961235288366","from":{"name":"Imran Aziz Bandukda","id":"1359388024"},"message":"Thank you bilal","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T13:34:48+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"380990651952091","from":{"name":"Misbah Nizami","id":"100000374500079"},"message":"Plz elaborate more when u write reviews Bill!

When people started being negative about Aylanto, I wanted to give them another chance to see if it was really that bad now. Our first experience at the new place was a C+ so I could not understand the horrible reviews they were getting. So, being a glutton for punishment, I took Mariyam Masood there for lunch today. Sigh, what can I say that it was a complete and utter disappointment! First, the positives. Good greeting at the door, polite waiters, cold water, fresh bread and courteous damage control. Unfortunately that is where it stops! Ordered the French Onion soup which actually was not too bad the last time but microscopic cheese on two pieces of french bread thrown in at the last minute so they were hard. When I sent it back, because at the time of the order I specified that I wanted it to be smothered in melting cheese, it returned with some additional grated but unmelted cheese. Strike One! Mariyam's Tarragon Chicken, which she loved at the old Aylanto, was two skinny pieces of chicken unable to really remain juicy or retain flavour. Strike Two! My steak was ordered medium rare and came medium well. Was replaced with one that was more like medium but by then I did not want to waste any more time or food and dutifully ate the average tasting steak. Strike Three! To their credit, one of their managers came to check when he had been told I was unhappy with our food and I shared my concerns with him. He was very apologetic and despite my repeated requests to the contrary, removed the soup and steak from the bill ... which made me very uncomfortable since that was not my intent in speaking with him. I told him that they really need to focus on their food if they are to stem the negative tide and he was receptive to the feedback. He requested that we return and he would personally take charge of our orders. However, unfortunately that is not what we want from any restaurant. Sure, people do take care of us at places we go to but then that is in their nature for ALL their customers, not just us. Overall, being a charitable person, I hope that they can return to the standards of yesteryear because at the moment, I find it very hard to point myself in the direction of Aylanto again. And that is a damn shame since I did enjoy my occasional visits there. The top management and owners have to take charge and do something because even a blind guy like me can see the problems screaming at me! Sorry Aylanto, I really am. I wanted to be positive and see hope but since things are sliding since my last visit, there is genuine cause for concern.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-04T10:18:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-04T18:07:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"603103229","name":"Danish Munir"},{"id":"698366264","name":"Ahsan R.

After having a lovely lunch was invited for dinner there too.  Olivetto seems to be the favorite these days as both at lunch and dinner it was a full house.  The smoked turkey salad with pasta was absolutely fabulous.  Also ordered the feta cheese salad and the mezzeh.  Both really delicious.  Thin crust smoked chicken pizza was my main course but also share the spicy  hummour which was outstanding.  Also tried the creme br?l?e for the first time a there which was served with a freshly baked cinnamon cookie.  One of the finest creme br?l?e I've had in recent times. On my special request the dessert chef of Olivetto made a really bitter chocolate lava which went very well with vanilla ice cream.  Friends with me were very happy with their main courses, pasta with spinach, jumbo tiger prawns, Moroccan chicken and baked stuffed chicken.  Yer another great experience in fine dining.
