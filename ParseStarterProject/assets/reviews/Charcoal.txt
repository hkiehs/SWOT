Really foamy and strong 10/10 to that for keeping me from freezing.\n\nNext up ordered the Chicken Corn Soup & Hot and Sour.\nI had the chicken corn which tasted amazing! \nClear to say the best soup this winter. Had loads of corn and was loaded with chunks of boneless chicken. Thick and creamy with herbs.\nWas just perfect. I will be going back for more\nSame goes for the Hot and Sour.\nPlus the bread along with the soup that needs a separate thumbs up.   \n\nTheir Grilled fish is the best iv tasted.\nPerfectly cooked and steaming hot when it arrived.\n\nThe Charcoal platter ain't short of praises either. No wonder its the most loved. Was so full that couldn't try everything on it. But my friend loved it. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted yummiliious.\n\nOverall perfect food for this amazing winter, backed up by flawless speedy service.\n\nMy new go to spot for these winters :) who says Kolachi is the best on the strip, i suppose Charcoal has the tendency to give them a run for their money very soon. Really happy with the improvement in their taste and service.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-23T21:39:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-24T15:43:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"612205150","name":"Syeda Sara Hussain"},{"id":"100000340878641","name":"Ali Amin"},{"id":"100000114257107","name":"Rimsha Altaf"},{"id":"100000956691585","name":"Sauliha Qureshi"},{"id":"100003305271172","name":"Muhammad Shaiekh"},{"id":"805195531","name":"Amna Shah"},{"id":"100004286853739","name":"Mahwish Khawja Ghulam Rasool"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"100001758628950","name":"Muzzi Hussain"},{"id":"1311140673","name":"Yumna Salvatore"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"1560344939","name":"Zahid Qureshi"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"628832080","name":"Nuruddin Noorani"},{"id":"100002796731318","name":"Ruba Baig"},{"id":"1567906191","name":"Humera Abbasi Lari"},{"id":"100002068418798","name":"Sumaira Junaid"},{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"100002186645209","name":"Asma Uzair"},{"id":"100003197584619","name":"Mairaj Khan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"614890544","name":"Syeda Hareem Zahra"},{"id":"100000744651030","name":"Farah Sadiq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzQ0NjUxMDMw","before":"NjI0NjMyMDk5"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_671113466273140/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTAwMDAwNzQ0NjUxMDMw"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"671114849606335","from":{"name":"Rabeet Rao","id":"749204552"},"message":"Been heading to the Do Darya strip more than often (does 2 times in 3 days qualify to be more-than-often?), and Charcoal has been the top priority (after Kolachi).

I just had dinner at Gon pacci too, with family. And honestly their service was PATHETIC! Firstly, we were told that our order will come in 15 minutes, instead it took 45 minutes for our order to come. And then when the food was served, it was COLD! Everything was cold. Also, we had ordered tarragon chicken, and as I'm a HUGE tarragon chicken lover, it's suppose to have thick sauce, and it was not thick AT ALL and had very little sauce. Secondly, they didn't serve us our drinks, I think they forgot or something, and when we called the waiter and asked him for the drinks he said 'arahi hain', after a while, the waiter showed up with ONE pepsi in his hand.. when we asked him where are the rest of the drinks he said 'arahi hain'.. a few minutes later he came with another drink.. again, just one drink, AGAIN! My dad got furious and sent it back. 5 people shared one can of pepsi.. IT WAS SO ANNOYING. I can never have food at a restaurant without pepsi! There was just one waiter serving the whole floor, I get that it's eid and all but if they are low on staff the least they could do is close one of the floors..  I could even hear other people getting all angry and cancelling their orders. \nWe actually went to have drinks when we left the restaurant.. And the sad part is, I was the one who forced my family to go to Gon Pacci just because I wanted to try the tarragon chicken..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-10T20:05:27+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-11T14:58:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"683092432","name":"Sabeen Fawad"},{"id":"514264591","name":"Aena Rizvi"},{"id":"100004102427163","name":"Malyha Shuja"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"516854962","name":"Nauman Khan"},{"id":"1419404438","name":"Muhammad Ahsan"},{"id":"100000322835107","name":"Hassan Saifullah"},{"id":"516333593","name":"Waqas Zia"},{"id":"539982540","name":"Arfa Abid"},{"id":"100001607651609","name":"Sarah Fariduddin"},{"id":"723835542","name":"Fariha Aamir Khan"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3Mjg3Mzkz","before":"NjgzMDkyNDMy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"601293773255110","from":{"name":"Saifullah Mazhar","id":"517287393"},"message":"Phir kab jana hae beta Gon Pacci hahaha","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T20:14:05+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601294849921669","from":{"name":"Ovais Khan Yousufzai","id":"1492617104"},"message":"5 people shared one can , thats love yo \u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T20:17:30+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601296259921528","from":{"name":"Ovais Khan Yousufzai","id":"1492617104"},"message":"Now you family can proudly say we have \"GON PACCI\" :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T20:22:53+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601298736587947","from":{"name":"Omair Ahmed","id":"509507958"},"message":"Gon Pacci surely Gone Paki ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T20:33:06+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601299656587855","from":{"name":"Sameer Mirza","id":"591022035"},"message":"lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T20:36:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601301579920996","from":{"name":"Zain A.

There were wide varieties of iftar from all sorts of chaats to chicken fry items, believe you me, not oily and tasty! There were 6 types of different salads , fresh and with nice presentation. Then there were many dishes fir buffet like sweet n sour prawns, live bbq, fish, three chicjen items, chibese, steaks and fried chicken. The soup was to die for. The awesome thing was , ten different sweets and desserts like cheese cake, chocolate fountain, coffe cake and other variety! The staff was very courteous, they served lemenode and one more iced drink along with nicely oacked dates in a plate complimentary. For namaz, the wash rooms were clean, separate place for wazu and special arrangement for prayers. The staff , managers and waiters were on continuous rounds to help people.  After iftar they gave everyone fresh set of spoons and napkins. Over all it was a very nice experience!! \n\nYesterday i saw a post regarding charcoal and the awful experience, i just want to ask the person if that person did report to the manager or not ? Please lets make sure if something goes wrong with us as customers, we make it a point to report it to the restaurants officials/people who are at the welcome desk ! \n\nPeople do make mistakes and I think they should be punished. But they should be forgiven and given the opportunity for a second chance.

Mirage is the only buffet themed restaurant at Do-Darya and is located right next to Kolachi. The ambience is nothing to write about as it?s almost the same as Kolachi, Charcoal, etc. We booked the whole upper deck unanimously for the view and later regretted the decision as the main food stations were downstairs.\nThe food stations are divided into 3 areas. The main food station is at the entrance while the BBQ section is at the upper left corner of the restaurant. The dessert and salad bar is in the top right corner.\nFor the price (Rs. 1000 per person inclusive of 1 soft drink) the food was very good. There were fresh batair?s (better than Lal-Qila?s), fried prawn tempura, Chicken Biryani, Goan Fish Curry, Chapli Kabab, pani puri are just some of the dishes that were tasted. The highlights however were the BBQ and the live chicken Karhai. The BBQ consisted of Chicken Malai Boti, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Chicken Tikka and Beef Namkeen Boti. The Malai Boti was succulent (but a little sweet for my taste) while Reshmi Kabab and Tikka were awesomely cooked (and Thank God not overcooked)  bu the Beef Namkeen Boti stole the show as it literally melted in our mouths.\nThe Karhai also has 4 varieties namely Peneer White, Peshawari Red, Green Masala and Namkeen Red Karhai. All four varieties were delicious and much better than what Kolachi serves.\nThe let down at Mirage were the salad and dessert station due to same variety as other buffets and also fried fish and the pasta dishes.\nOverall we really enjoyed our food and had a fantastic evening. Best part was that there was no hassle from the waiters or the mangers to clear the table (like they do at Kolachi & Ginsoy).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-27T18:52:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T09:29:10+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"736425186","name":"Maryam Zahoor Ansari"},{"id":"772910592","name":"Shyam Sunder"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"100000226962956","name":"Sumiaya Arif"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"711050864","name":"Abdul Raheem Khan"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"NzM2NDI1MTg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"548935991824222","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Aaquib Arif","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-27T21:28:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"549210141796807","from":{"name":"Zarfras Siddiki","id":"100003898006618"},"message":"seems they(Kolachi and Ginsoy) are quite busy in their business and they care for walk in customers,to avoid waiting in queue,,caring for customers by Kolachi and Ginsoy thats good,,","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T08:19:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549233218461166","from":{"name":"Muhammed Umer Mulla","id":"595408686"},"message":"Well yes but what if you are in thr middle of a meal and the bill is presented to you or when you try to relax the waiter constantly remind you to clear the table as they have a big cue....I mean can't they wait for say 5 mins","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T09:48:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549380488446439","from":{"name":"Sumiaya Arif","id":"100000226962956"},"message":"I second that muhammed umer mulla","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T14:42:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549876995063455","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"5-7 Mins should be max before which the Bill sould be asked for & settled.

My heart melts for this place whenever I even think about it. This time my husband and I were again on a mission - on the list were forty4, BOTS, necos(it's a tradition), ginsoy, LALS, Latte lounge, studio cafe, Fat burger, Charcoal, Papa rotti and Flo. Forty4 blew us away; the service, choice of menu and the red velvet cake! Omgggg!!! Double drool! BOTS: well ppl of Khi ate my brains out that I HAVE to try it and since we are crazy about sea food it was like a MUST TRY on our lists- sigh! Disappointed! All it had was spice which we didn't mind but the quality of food was average, not mind blowing at all..mediocre seafood for premium price..won't be going there again! Necos has still managed to maintain its gorgeous quality so yes we loved each and every bit of our breakfast and fish! Latte lounge was ok for a shisha hang out and so was road side and studio cafe. Charcoal was good but we did end up with an upset stomach! Papa roti was of international standards...Fat Burger was well a fat burger-ok ok..LALS was a sure value for money and so was ginsoy. As usual came back hungry from FLO! All in all Khi still has emaculate food to offer but this time I felt people are preferring prices over quality, maybe because everything has become so expensivw...and that was really not my Karachi! Oh and yes how can I forget noodle house! Uff...the wasabi prawns, vermicelli noodles and fried calamari alongside beef teriyaki! It's a must must must try! 10 pounds added to my already upscale weight but I LOVE it! :D","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-01T08:00:30+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-02T11:02:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"500616229","name":"Sama Aman"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"892195391","name":"Tehreem Fatima"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"786945014","name":"Samia Chundrigar"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Disappointment #1. As a backup, we called Kolachi at 10pm, they said that if we wanted to reserve a table.. they expect us to go all the way to Phase 8 and get our name written which would result in us getting a table 1 hour AFTER the name was written. Disappointment # 2. So we went to Charcoal, and were HIGHLY disappointed. We ordered Hot & Sour soup and Mozarella sticks from the starters, Chicken Lasange, Ultimate Double Chicken, Jalapeno Burger, Chicken Peshawari, Tarragon Chicken and one more steak.

Went there yesterday, the overall service was okay, but the setup of serving was small according to the number of people for the iftar. Food quality was very much below average. I was literary finding something good to eat. Charcoal is a BBQ and Grill place and only 1 BBQ item was served which was reshmi kabab. I literary had to fight to cut my pepper steak, it was almost like a rubber and very poorly cooked. Prawns were served almost raw. The only eatable thing i found was chicken karhaye and Beef Chillie. The desserts were pathetic, i was expecting some good taste after looking at the desserts area. The ice-cream was like a frozen sweet milk. The chocolate cake and other chocolate items had a very bad taste. I will definitely not recommend anyone to go to Charcoal BBQ & Grill.

Amazing food and service\n\nordered finger fish and Mumtu for starters\n\nFinger fish was good-loved the lemony taste \nMumtu was something very unique. It was steamed pasta kinda pouch filled with mince served with a sauce. yummy!\n\nhummus was alright but it was served with garlic nan instead of a pita\n\nrest of the order was from the desi menu.\nPeshawari karahi\nTikka handi \nKastori kebab\nMalai Boti \nLebanese Kebab\n\nKarahi and Handi both were very delicious. You could taste the spices, oh very yummy. \n\nbar b que was good too and what else do you want if it is served with a perfect chutney.\n\nall in all the experience was great. Much better than Charcoal. \n\nThe atmosphere was good too and the best part is its spacious.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-24T21:45:12+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-24T22:23:37+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"539982540","name":"Arfa Abid"},{"id":"685724884","name":"Ayesha Siddiqui"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQyMTIyMzE2NA\u003d\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"403553989695757","from":{"name":"Bushra Joyo","id":"1421223164"},"message":"I loved Kolachi !

Ambiance was nice, a serene enviroment welcomes you on arrival. Unlike other places on that strip its not overcrowded despite having a crowded look on the outside. Seating arrangement is spacious and comfortable, with sofa's and chairs at three different levels. They have a upper deck, a middle level, a lower deck and a sheesha lounge, the middle two being right on the ocean and one can actually feel the tide come and hit the rocks below coupled will the flood lights on the sea which creates an enchanting effect.Coming to the service aspect both the staff and servers are more like programmed robots and need to be more vigilant to the diners needs, they keep sauntering around the place but to get hold of them is a tough task. A bottle of water took 15-20 minutes to arrive, its seemed like they were manufacturing it, drinks arrived ten minutes after dinner was served and I had to remind them, coordination is lacking and staff was not properly trained in this aspect. Ordered their Charcoal Combo platter, which was fresh and crisp comprising of batter fried mushrooms, chicken wings and fried chicken with mozzarella cheese accompanied with two yummy dips, also had the Beef Cheese Burger and Chicken Fajita Burger both well done, were well flavored, succulent pieces of grilled chicken breast and had a spicy tinge, but the bread was not as it should be, a bit soggy and quality of the bun could be improved, fries could be more crisp. For desert had Blueberry Cheese Cake was very good, light and fluffy with a biscuit crust, really melted in the mouth, a generous helping for two to three weight watchers. Overall experience was good, a place which stands out from the crowd and has an air of sophistication, recommended for foreign guests who may have the impression that Karachi is a city under siege or civil war, taking them to this places will showcase the soft face of Karachi and the beauty of the sea. They just need to work a tad bit more on their service.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-24T11:24:45+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-24T15:29:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"741265709","name":"Sarah Hasnat"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQxMjY1NzA5","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"403364046381418","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Try Kolachi next time.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T15:11:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403370973047392","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Kolachi is the next target...what do u recommend?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T15:27:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403372099713946","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Hunzai Handi.

And then I hear mostly good reviews about the same place. And when I do try the place, the positive vibes have been proved correct. Kolachi and Tutti Frutti are the 2 places in subject here. \n\nHad the chocolate and the original flavor and I am at a loss for words. This was the most amazing willy-wonka-ish experience since Funland. I felt like a kid in Disneyland. The froyo is yummy, the place is oozing with colors, smiles, flavor and so much positivity. I was delighted! The delegate was in a rush so we couldnt wait for the toppings (sad) but they looked yum. But anyways the fro-yo was to-die-for. No after taste, the original was tangy..just enough tangy.....and the chocolate was a little like dark chocolate...and mixed together it was heaven. Oh yeah and it had the best consistency right till the last lick. And yes priced beautifully. P.S - No receipts. But oh well.\n\nKolachi. Man. Charcoal's ambiance has taken a back seat in my books. WHAT a place, tastefully done, EXCELLENT sofas and seating, Kolachi is a must-visit. Now for the food, FINALLY  a place on phase 8 that is a complete package! Food AND ambiance! Had the Hunzai Handi. OMG. It was divine. The right balance of spice and gravy with soft tender pieces of chicken that melts in your mouth, this is a must have. The bihari boti and paratha were nothing to write home about as I have had better. Honestly, these two items were Charcoal's standard. Bland. But that handi and oh yes! the prawn starter totally nailed it! The prices are steep - 1 starter, 1 handi and 1 plate bihari kebab, 2 nans and 1 paratha, 1 large water bottle and 1 drink Rs. 2180. Steep as the quantity was exactly for 2 people (nothing was left over) which means that it is expensive and less quantity (1000 per head) Having said that, if you have plans for phase 8, this is where u wanna go.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-31T19:45:34+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-01T09:26:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"828190023","name":"Shaheen Nouman"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQxNDk1NjI1","before":"ODI4MTkwMDIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"389951377722685","from":{"name":"Lubna Ashraf Jafri","id":"501447368"},"message":"Wow, sounds like someone had a great experience at both the places and is satiated :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-31T22:23:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"389951684389321","from":{"name":"Lubna Ashraf Jafri","id":"501447368"},"message":"I love both TF and Kolachi too :)\nTF gotta be my favorite place for froyo these days!

And i like mine well done so i made sure to tell him many times that it HAS to be well done, and thankfully it was. Juicy, flavorful and well done. My steak was just great. Loved the ambience, the food and even the music. I found their music collection to be quite up to date and nice. A combination of latest english, hindi AND pakistani tracks.

As compared to that Sajjad has consistency in quality of food but they too take a life time to serve their food  and need to improve on that, seems they have a shortage of staff or the line supervisors are not managing them properly.As compared to that Kababeesh's food and quality was prompt and attentive and the staff was trained to respond to their customer needs, but because it is at the end, it is not getting the attention it deserves.Ambala was another place which is quite good but needs to improve their service as the staff is uncontrolled and needs to be reminded that as a customer I demand good service quality.

Ordered the starter of the Charcoal Platter consisting of fried chicken slices with cheese, fish fingers, chicken wings & deep fried button mushrooms served with 4 dippers. That plate was emptied within mintues by 3 adults & 3 kids - verdict - yummy n felt like ordering more!\n\nMain courses:\n\n1) Mushroom Steak with mashed potatoes - It was beef, juicy and well done, served withg fantastic taste of mashied potatoes.\n\n2) Fish & Chip - 2 slices of fish fillets served with salad and fries. Quite a serving that my mom still had 1 sliced left coz she was too full. Served with tartar sauce and a dipper for the fries which was really crispy.\n\n3) Charcoal Mix Platter - enough for 2 - Grilled prawns wz sliced capsicum, small slice of lemon and onion - a lil spicy but not desi :) Steak with sauce, again juicy n yummy. Fish fillet - crispy on the outside but soft in the inside, chicken piece with white sauce - no complain and lastly their awesome mashed potatoes!\n\n4) Popcorn Chicken with fries (kiddy meal) - Big popcorn chicken deep fried just nice, crispy and juice and yummy fries that was served with it with the dipper. Had to order another one coz the elder son didnt want to share! :)\n\nDesserts -\n\n1) Brownie - Big chunk of brownie served in a tall glass, surrounded with yummy ice cream vanilla ice cream, huge portion, can be shared.\n\n2) Chocolate Mousse - smooth and chocolatey at the right amount.\n\n3) Cheesecake with caramel - Delish and with the caramel on top it added just the right amount of sweetness to it,just perfect to end our evening by the sea.\n\nGreat service, ambiance and definitely worth a visit.

Ambiance was nice, a serene enviroment welcomes you on arrival. Unlike other places on that strip its not overcrowded despite having a crowded look on the outside. Seating arrangement is spacious and comfortable, with sofa's and chairs at three different levels. They have a upper deck, a middle level, a lower deck and a sheesha lounge, the middle two being right on the ocean and one can actually feel the tide come and hit the rocks below coupled will the flood lights on the sea which creates an enchanting effect.Coming to the service aspect both the staff and servers are more like programmed robots and need to be more vigilant to the diners needs, they keep sauntering around the place but to get hold of them is a tough task. A bottle of water took 15-20 minutes to arrive, its seemed like they were manufacturing it, drinks arrived ten minutes after dinner was served and I had to remind them, coordination is lacking and staff was not properly trained in this aspect. Ordered their Charcoal Combo platter, which was fresh and crisp comprising of batter fried mushrooms, chicken wings and fried chicken with mozzarella cheese accompanied with two yummy dips, also had the Beef Cheese Burger and Chicken Fajita Burger both well done, were well flavored, succulent pieces of grilled chicken breast and had a spicy tinge, but the bread was not as it should be, a bit soggy and quality of the bun could be improved, fries could be more crisp. For desert had Blueberry Cheese Cake was very good, light and fluffy with a biscuit crust, really melted in the mouth, a generous helping for two to three weight watchers. Overall experience was good, a place which stands out from the crowd and has an air of sophistication, recommended for foreign guests who may have the impression that Karachi is a city under siege or civil war, taking them to this places will showcase the soft face of Karachi and the beauty of the sea. They just need to work a tad bit more on their service.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-24T11:24:45+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-24T15:29:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"741265709","name":"Sarah Hasnat"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQxMjY1NzA5","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"403364046381418","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Try Kolachi next time.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T15:11:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403370973047392","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Kolachi is the next target...what do u recommend?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T15:27:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403372099713946","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Hunzai Handi.

Went there yesterday, the overall service was okay, but the setup of serving was small according to the number of people for the iftar. Food quality was very much below average. I was literary finding something good to eat. Charcoal is a BBQ and Grill place and only 1 BBQ item was served which was reshmi kabab. I literary had to fight to cut my pepper steak, it was almost like a rubber and very poorly cooked. Prawns were served almost raw. The only eatable thing i found was chicken karhaye and Beef Chillie. The desserts were pathetic, i was expecting some good taste after looking at the desserts area. The ice-cream was like a frozen sweet milk. The chocolate cake and other chocolate items had a very bad taste. I will definitely not recommend anyone to go to Charcoal BBQ & Grill. Their a la carte is good, but at iftar buffet and dinner; they have seriously compromised the quality.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-11T00:47:15+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-11T00:47:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"668090430","name":"Qazi Umair"},{"id":"507348941","name":"Muhammad Waqas"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA3MzQ4OTQx","before":"NjY4MDkwNDMw"}}},"restaurantName":"Charcoal"},{"id":"165861103465048_279238225460668","from":{"name":"Ezwana R-Zaman","id":"701414399"},"message":"Went to Charcoal BBQ n Grill last night. Ordered the starter of the Charcoal Platter consisting of fried chicken slices with cheese, fish fingers, chicken wings & deep fried button mushrooms served with 4 dippers. That plate was emptied within mintues by 3 adults & 3 kids - verdict - yummy n felt like ordering more!\n\nMain courses:\n\n1) Mushroom Steak with mashed potatoes - It was beef, juicy and well done, served withg fantastic taste of mashied potatoes.\n\n2) Fish & Chip - 2 slices of fish fillets served with salad and fries. Quite a serving that my mom still had 1 sliced left coz she was too full. Served with tartar sauce and a dipper for the fries which was really crispy.\n\n3) Charcoal Mix Platter - enough for 2 - Grilled prawns wz sliced capsicum, small slice of lemon and onion - a lil spicy but not desi :) Steak with sauce, again juicy n yummy. Fish fillet - crispy on the outside but soft in the inside, chicken piece with white sauce - no complain and lastly their awesome mashed potatoes!\n\n4) Popcorn Chicken with fries (kiddy meal) - Big popcorn chicken deep fried just nice, crispy and juice and yummy fries that was served with it with the dipper. Had to order another one coz the elder son didnt want to share! :)\n\nDesserts -\n\n1) Brownie - Big chunk of brownie served in a tall glass, surrounded with yummy ice cream vanilla ice cream, huge portion, can be shared.\n\n2) Chocolate Mousse - smooth and chocolatey at the right amount.\n\n3) Cheesecake with caramel - Delish and with the caramel on top it added just the right amount of sweetness to it,just perfect to end our evening by the sea.\n\nGreat service, ambiance and definitely worth a visit. Will put up some photos soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-17T04:19:31+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-17T04:51:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"610590030","name":"Najam Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjEwNTkwMDMw","before":"MTA5ODQwOTE3MQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"279249205459570","from":{"name":"Mohsin E Azam","id":"622525326"},"message":"I second that...
