We seemed to have taken the management by surprise since they did not seem to be expecting any clients! We were their only guests for brunch this Sunday it appears. This is sad since the food is quite good and the city has a paucity of good desi food outlets.\nThe service was exceedingly slow even though the waiters outnumbered the clients 2 to 1. And we over ordered massively since we were told by the waiter that it is a single serving (single serving? For desi food? Yeah, right!). Also, our group had bipolar disorder, one end of the table not knowing what the other end had ordered, so the food kept coming! But again, the food was seriously good. \nOf course this kind of brunch obviates the need for dinner and then breakfast next day!\nHowever, I don?t think Desi will be around for long?.a pity.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-04T08:58:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-04T13:37:51+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"},{"id":"671130091","name":"Amenah Jafarey"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcxMTMwMDkx","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"500390030012152","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"Desi has great food.

Anyways, not to dwell into farewell depression, i tried my best to cover all eateries as i could. Summary and ranking goes like:\n\nNew places:\n1. Bella vita- great gelato and a very different pizza! Must visit\n\n2. Kolachi- full marks for ambience( despite 50min wait) and one if the best beef botis, though garlic rice were a big disappointment! Karahi was great!\n\n3. Olivetto- tried there pan asian prawns with rice! Sluurrpp! Veryyyyy nice and must try!\n\n4. Xanders- very nice tomato soup and calamari starter, but the menu lacked depth for dinner. Suggest it to be a breakfast/brunch place thn dinners. Ordered jalape?o chicken pizza but the staff mistakenly served margarita. But they were courteous and apologetic! Hence, forgiven.\n\nOldies which are still goldies:\n\nNo one can beat Zahid ki nihari with garam garam naan still!!!\n\nBots was supreme!! The food covered up for poor service! Honestly, once it arrived (prawn karahi, fried pangush fish, fried prawns)we forgot tht it took ages to get someone to clean the table and take thr order. Ad always, didnt disappoint at all.\n\nTai pan- suprisingly great lunch food! Unlike many years ago whn i went and got served with a bee in the soup :) but this time,everything was awesome.\n\nGlorias beef chilli wrap also was a fav this trip!\n\nBoat basin ka subah ka halwa puri had still maintained its 'to die for' value! The dhaba roadside fun i miss!\n\nNandos- lemme tell you this, pakistans nandos takes the prize of the best nandos around! The depth in menu and the taste is what makes it the best!\n\nDynasty- unfotunately trip to dynasty was marred by sudden bout of sickness, and getting all food packed without even looking- the other disappointment was one of the best hotels in town didnt have panadol in first aid, and the pharmacy hd closed at 9! Made me wonder, wat wud guests do if they needed it in middle of night.\n\nChairman mao- no compromise on quality- still the same good hot n sour soup, chicken schezuan and fried rice!\n\nChatkharay and gazebo- never fail to bring your taste buds alive with the bun kabab, chaat and qeema!\n\nAnddd pompei- blue cheese pizza rocks my socks :)\n\nYummmmm! Just writing abt all these places is making me want them!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-02T18:50:16+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-02T18:50:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"552709635","name":"Tubaa Mansoor"},{"id":"634769006","name":"Nida Mansoor"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"673105463","name":"Fatima Baig"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"1160136117","name":"Shehni Kamran"},{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid"},{"id":"515852871","name":"Wasil Sami Khan"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"514440277","name":"M?ri?
