But being a sunday night, and having crazy rush everywhere else, we didn't have much of an option for desi food.\nSo anyway, as soon as we got seated, the waiters were very polite and courteous. Took our order quickly, were prompt with suggestions, served quickly and were generally impressive.\nFirst came the complimentary Gol Guppay and Dahi Puri - both of which were 9/10!! the paani in gol gappay was better than any other i've tasted and the puris in both were crisp and tasty.\nThen the food - we ordered dum ka keema, malai boti, dhaaga kebab, mutton karhai and fish tikka. (with roghni & garlic naan plus sheermal)\nEverything tasted AMAZING except for the fisk tikka. That was the only thing we didn't enjoy.\nThen we ordered dessert (shahi tukray and gulab jamun), both of which were not good.\nOverall speaking - a VERY good experience with food and service. 8/10 with only issues being that dessert was not good at all and fish tikka was stale. (Plus a little on the pricey side ~ 900/person.)\nVery happy with the experience :D","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-16T16:06:12+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-17T08:09:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000051806482","name":"Saquib Currim"},{"id":"581870213","name":"Saad Noma"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100001772445260","name":"Zamzam Shah"},{"id":"100003079123808","name":"Waseem Izzat"},{"id":"100002252913885","name":"Haseeb Sami"},{"id":"705430280","name":"Haris Mahmood"},{"id":"1257237310","name":"Taha Usman"},{"id":"1195811332","name":"Ahmed Shahab"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"758853691","name":"Shah M Alam"},{"id":"728987421","name":"Rayyan Sohail"},{"id":"100000446704703","name":"Almas Mehmood"},{"id":"100007310070601","name":"Urban KaveGirl"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"100000764441277","name":"Shahyaan Abd"},{"id":"597000855","name":"Anita N Anil"},{"id":"1360287056","name":"Afshan Riaz Bhayani"},{"id":"756768261","name":"Muhammad Aslam"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"100002364449168","name":"Mansoor Hussain"},{"id":"745130093","name":"HG Bachani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ1MTMwMDkz","before":"MTAwMDAwMDUxODA2NDgy"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_667621676622319/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzQ1MTMwMDkz"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"667630359954784","from":{"name":"Muhammad Aslam","id":"756768261"},"message":"I have been going there ever since they had opened .

Usually avoid going to the fancy restaurants offering desi cuisine because let's face it, we all love the roadside food regardless of its hygienic value. Anyhow, this place has really come out as a surprise ! Our order included the following:\n- Nihari\n- Biryani\n- Haleem\nThe Nihari is an absolute treat for the taste buds considering I personally am not a huge fam of Nihari. Desi makes its Nihari in Yakhni and it is the sort that you don't barf all day after having some. The quantity was good enough for 5 of us. It's slightly less thicker than we usually have everywhere else. The one DESI offers is light and tastes exceptionally good as compared to other Nihari walas around. Highly recommended !\n\nDesi's Biryani is something that I have not skipped in the last two visits to this place. Those who have tried it know it very well so won't go into the details. Great quantity and taste. Easily the best offered among other competing restaurants.\n\nThe Haleem *sigh*. I thought I'd never have Haleem anytime during the year except the Moharram season, but this was exquisite.

Otherwise the service has improved alot. We were five people and we ordered Moroccan style steak, tenderloin steak, tarragon chicken, fish burger and fatsoo burger! Everything was served on time and was pipping hot! I just wish they didn't have generator problem, we could had enjoyed a bit more there and yes its a shame that they couldn't serve their famous mint coolers.

I just had dinner at Gon pacci too, with family. And honestly their service was PATHETIC! Firstly, we were told that our order will come in 15 minutes, instead it took 45 minutes for our order to come. And then when the food was served, it was COLD! Everything was cold. Also, we had ordered tarragon chicken, and as I'm a HUGE tarragon chicken lover, it's suppose to have thick sauce, and it was not thick AT ALL and had very little sauce. Secondly, they didn't serve us our drinks, I think they forgot or something, and when we called the waiter and asked him for the drinks he said 'arahi hain', after a while, the waiter showed up with ONE pepsi in his hand.. when we asked him where are the rest of the drinks he said 'arahi hain'.. a few minutes later he came with another drink.. again, just one drink, AGAIN! My dad got furious and sent it back. 5 people shared one can of pepsi.. IT WAS SO ANNOYING. I can never have food at a restaurant without pepsi! There was just one waiter serving the whole floor, I get that it's eid and all but if they are low on staff the least they could do is close one of the floors..  I could even hear other people getting all angry and cancelling their orders. \nWe actually went to have drinks when we left the restaurant.. And the sad part is, I was the one who forced my family to go to Gon Pacci just because I wanted to try the tarragon chicken..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-10T20:05:27+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-11T14:58:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"683092432","name":"Sabeen Fawad"},{"id":"514264591","name":"Aena Rizvi"},{"id":"100004102427163","name":"Malyha Shuja"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"516854962","name":"Nauman Khan"},{"id":"1419404438","name":"Muhammad Ahsan"},{"id":"100000322835107","name":"Hassan Saifullah"},{"id":"516333593","name":"Waqas Zia"},{"id":"539982540","name":"Arfa Abid"},{"id":"100001607651609","name":"Sarah Fariduddin"},{"id":"723835542","name":"Fariha Aamir Khan"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3Mjg3Mzkz","before":"NjgzMDkyNDMy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"601293773255110","from":{"name":"Saifullah Mazhar","id":"517287393"},"message":"Phir kab jana hae beta Gon Pacci hahaha","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T20:14:05+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601294849921669","from":{"name":"Ovais Khan Yousufzai","id":"1492617104"},"message":"5 people shared one can , thats love yo \u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T20:17:30+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601296259921528","from":{"name":"Ovais Khan Yousufzai","id":"1492617104"},"message":"Now you family can proudly say we have \"GON PACCI\" :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T20:22:53+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601298736587947","from":{"name":"Omair Ahmed","id":"509507958"},"message":"Gon Pacci surely Gone Paki ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T20:33:06+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601299656587855","from":{"name":"Sameer Mirza","id":"591022035"},"message":"lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T20:36:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601301579920996","from":{"name":"Zain A.

Wonderful food! Service was a bit slow and there were a few mess ups with the food ordered, but that is understandable seeing as it's Eid and they were probably short on staff :)\nFor starters we ordered a Tomato and Olives Bruschetta. We ordered one, but they gave us two orders :p well, that doesn't matter because we quite enjoyed the starter as it was quite lovely. The soup was ordered was Tomato Soup. It was absolutely divine and creamy and just plain yumm.\nThe main courses were Grilled Chicken with Tarragon Sauce, Grilled Chicken with Mushroom Risotto and Spicy Japanese Chicken. My own main was the Tarragon Chicken and I loved it. Though I do wish there was a little more tarragon sauce. Either way, the chicken was cooked to perfection, the sauce delicious, as were the accompanying saut?ed veggies and mashed potatoes. My mom's main was the chicken with mushroom risotto and she loved her dish, as did I. I love mushrooms and i love risotto and I've found that not many restaurants can put the two together and make it taste divine, by Olivetto and Gon Pacci really do make a really tasty mushroom risotto. I didn't get to try more than a bite of the Spicy Japanese Chicken, that too at the very end, but what I tasted was quite lovely and perfectly spiced.\nOur drinks were a Hazelnut Frappe and an Affogato. Both were perfectly sweet, cold and refreshing, as they were meant to be. All in all, a wonderful fine dining experience!

The iftar items comprised of spring rolls, pakoras, singaporean samosas, prawn tempura, sandwiches, mini burgers, fruit chaat and chollah. All fresh and yummy. we were then asked by the waiter if we would like to have shikanjbeen which was also on the house and it was very refreshing. Then we proceeded again to the buffet table for our dinner, the dishes were moroccan chicken, garlic rice, beef pepper steaks, sauteed vegetables, shashlik, seekh kebab, yakhni pukao, chicken cream crepe, penne arabitta, red snapper. and u wont believe it was simply awesome... very rare u get to eat at a buffet where all the dishes are equally gud and u cant decide which to opt for second helping. When we returned to our table we were again asked if we would like to try their mint cooler (mint lemonade) which was again on the house. The desserts were mini cheese cake, mini chocolate fudge cake and eclairs. ALL THIS IN JUST 999+tax which came upto 1183 per head.\nThe most commendable was the way we served, the staff was very very courteous and efficient. i have not seen such a civilized buffet in ages. and yes on our way out a professional photographer was there to take out pic which i received on my email, a true cheery on top.

I went there with my friend Amna Hussain on 30th June on her recommendation specifically to eat burgers. We were served complimentary shots of some milkshake drink before the meal was served, which was very sweet of them. I ordered a burger with Mushrooms and a lemon mint drink, and my friend ordered a burger too. I have forgotten wat burger it was. The service was quick since the place was almost empty during maghrib time. As you can see in the pics, the presentation is very bad. They literally put a teaspoon of coleslaw in the corner. The fries were undercooked (kacha taste). The bun was of low quality, very local. The beef pattie was soft but again it was undercooked and almost had no salt (pheeka). The mushrooms were stale. I pulled out one from the burger to see if it was really a mushroom and not celery. The food overall had a raw taste. The cheese cake and drinks were ok. No plans of visiting LOG INN LOUNGE to eat burgers atleast ever.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-06T23:16:02+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-08T11:07:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"565340149","name":"Rabeeya Iftikhar"},{"id":"1256236750","name":"Muhammad Saad Khan"},{"id":"100005945647613","name":"Sara H Khan"},{"id":"844605276","name":"Salman Vidhani"},{"id":"649049339","name":"Basit Saeed"},{"id":"500907007","name":"Murtaza Moiz"},{"id":"1058171190","name":"Fahad-Pakistani Zaidi"},{"id":"660885104","name":"Junaid Mansoor Khan"},{"id":"1579891410","name":"Erum Siddiqui"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTU3OTg5MTQxMA\u003d\u003d","before":"NTY1MzQwMTQ5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"581556461895508","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"I don't remember asking at all.

By local I meant the bun they use in bun kababz that r locally served for much lesser price. If im paying 500 or 600 for a burger, I expect the bun not to crumble all over the plate. Question?where do these ppl at mc donalds get their bun from? It has a better taste and it doesnt crumble. Isn't good quality bun supposed to hold the burger togather?? 2. Stale tasting mushrooms like celery!! Well chef at Log Inn Lounge needs to answer this. They put the funny tasting mushrooms in there. I even asked my friend if they mentioned celery in the description of the burger on the menu card! They looked yellow and smelled weird. 3. I did not return the food coz I was exhausted at that time. Wanted to get back home asap and sleep. Complaining would have meant spending another 30 minutes there. I went back home and ate watever was in the fridge. 4. U are tagged coz in a previous post, someone commented on Pantry and called it a waste of money to which u had asked the person not to be evasive but explain why she didnt like pantry.

Log Inn has always had some of the best burgers in town, but maybe not everyone will like the texture and taste.

However, I do think that if you are going to complain or post in a public forum, you should at least have informed the restaurant when it happened and given them a chance to fix things. Anyone can have a bad moment and generally are happy to address customer concerns immediately. Posting negative comments here doesn't hurt them given the multitude of positive experiences and comments from others, but it does not seem fair given that they were never given the opportunity to address your concerns.

Even though the delivery time took about 15 minutes longer than their promised 45 minutes (and each minute seemed like an eternity because we were famished), nonetheless, the food was great. Ordered the Juicy Beef Burger deal with fries  along with Spicy Fettucinni Alfredo with Garlic Bread. \n\nThe burger was absolutely delicious. Im not a big fan of beef burgers but this is definitely the kind of beef I would love to eat again; spicy, smoked, and just bursting with flavor! The burger was big and the serving of fries was also very generous.\n\nThe pasta I didn't like that much because it tasted too much of cream, plus the \"spicy\" element just didn't fit in with the taste of fettucinni alfredo we're generally used to. It wasn't bad either, my friends liked it so I guess all was good.\n\nVerdict: Gon Pacci has great food (with great prices to boot). Just a little work on their delivery service to make it a true winner. :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-04T16:07:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-04T19:50:29+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"519066927","name":"Maaheen Fahad"},{"id":"513139038","name":"Rabiya Shahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEzMTM5MDM4","before":"NTc1Mjc2NzUy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"553104121407409","from":{"name":"Kiran Afzal","id":"635810442"},"message":"The term 'deal' sounds interesting :D .. let me check them out .. \nand they delivered to your place? that's brilliant ..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-04T16:13:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"553111604739994","from":{"name":"Ambreen Ashraf","id":"675647072"},"message":"Sigh..I wish.

The server came back to me saying it wasn't anything but a really dried rice grain. I told her that was certainly not the case. She did take my serving back and came with another one, same meal. We ordered lava cake and it was really good. To my surprise, I was amazed at the management team that no one said anything about the meal and instead they just sat there. If nothing they felt was wrong, my meal should've have been replaced in the first place. I later in the eve went to Gon Pacci again to have the lava cake packed to have it at home and the cake had no chocolate and was all dry. Disappointed. Good will gestures, courtesy and an apology if anything goes wrong can make you visit again no matter how hopeless. If anything goes wrong the least any manager or owner can do- walking up the customer and talk which goes on to show it is in their knowledge.

Super comfy and cozy; somewhere you'd love to curl up with a book and coffee. Food had good and average both. Starters were tangy chicken Salas (really nice!) And fristo bisto the seafood platter (disappointingly oily). Among entrees of mushroom chicken risotto, Mongolian chicken and Japanese chicken, the risotto stood out with a true Mediterranean touch. Nothing wrong with the other two but not something you'll get.excited about. Drinks were great. Suggestion to include tea varieties (especially Turkish) in the menu since one needs something to cut through the heavy food in the end. Would do again for the ambiance and the excellent prompt service!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-04T17:43:44+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-04T20:01:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"530485619","name":"Hana Faisal"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"654585432","name":"Zeest Shabbir"},{"id":"594934104","name":"Soobia Rehman"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyMzc0OTE3MDM5","before":"NTMwNDg1NjE5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"456099151107907","from":{"name":"Zeest Shabbir","id":"654585432"},"message":"Shahnawaz Moti","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-04T20:01:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"698764443","name":"Shahnawaz Moti","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDU2MDk5MTUxMTA3OTA3","before":"NDU2MDk5MTUxMTA3OTA3"}}},"restaurantName":"Gon Pacci"},{"id":"165861103465048_453643374686818","from":{"name":"Hana Faisal","id":"530485619"},"message":"Mushroom Risotto at @Gon Pacci .
