It surely gave my chicken wingssss... \n\nOk so we ordered 1 Zinger, 1 Beef burger with cheese, for our two outcasts :p \nAnd countless Qtr. Broasts (i lost count after the first 6)\n\nZinger: It looked appetising, amazing size good value for money. And by the look of the empty devoured plate in the end im pretty sure It was well enjoyed.\n\nBeef Burger with Cheese:\nOrdered by our second non brostie.\nUpon asking hi the rating went like \nIt was great..good.. Average tha..\nSo if u are trying to compare it to the BK ka whooper like we initially were trying to do, look the other way :p\n\nThe fried chickies aka Karachi ka Broast.\nThe first look: Defiantly huge portions.\nToo much on the oily side.\nThe fries looked like dead dried fishes. \nTaste: according to one fellow foodie the wings tasted like buffalo wings (i wouldnt know i fed mine to the kitties) \n\nPs: the fresh lime i ordered was nimbo pani with an over load of kali mirch.. Yeekkhh \n\n \nOverall:\nHad an average taste, very average nothing to rave about. All the hype is defiantly over rated.    \nService was very sad, one waiter running around the whole floor.\nWill not be going again for the food.\nBut then again the prices were dirt cheap so i wouldnt expect anything else. \n\nALSO after all that being said.\nAll those people who care about hygiene should avoide. \nThe place is crawling with cats. \nEven though i am well. But two of our members fell sick as soon as they reached home. Which is unacceptable.There was something seriously wrong with the chicken. So i think a visit from the health inspectors is due to that place.  \nUntil that i think im staying away.\n\nLast but not the least.\nThankyou everyone who joined us. Was a pleasure meeting you guys. :) \nHope to see you guys again real soon.\n\n*An invader from Foodies Food Invasions*","type":"photo","created_time":"2014-01-05T15:13:51+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-10T21:02:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000595182709","name":"Umair Chaudhry UC"},{"id":"100000605712128","name":"Kashif Jakhrani"},{"id":"100001971013076","name":"Zohaib Hassan"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"816865264","name":"Muhammad Arsalan Siddiqui"},{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"873280323","name":"Umair Zia"},{"id":"100001542765153","name":"Umair Zahid"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"100000107764417","name":"M Kashif Malik"},{"id":"1224016566","name":"Asif Rasheed Ghani"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"100002154180249","name":"Afifa J Maniar"},{"id":"617393721","name":"Ali Sheheryar Khan"},{"id":"100001075455207","name":"Ahsan Ahmed"},{"id":"568465423","name":"Yasir Hasan"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"1236316260","name":"Taimoor Nadeem"},{"id":"669320704","name":"Fahad Azad"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"742775803","name":"Nabeel Islam"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"517581738","name":"Armughan Ahmed Faruqi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3NTgxNzM4","before":"MTAwMDAwNTk1MTgyNzA5"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_677950858922734/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTE3NTgxNzM4"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"677952425589244","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Thats the branch i got a tharki roach from, lin marofying on my food with his rather wiggly antennae! :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:17:48+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677952932255860","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"We missed u too Sohaaaa :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:18:59+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677953475589139","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"hahaha Me not tharki roach :p I m shadeedun shareefun :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:19:41+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677956665588820","from":{"name":"Syeda Wajeeha","id":"564340227"},"message":"Love there raita uff","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:26:25+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677957455588741","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Zaid Tehsin: ya sorry to burst ur bubble but they do and feel free not to read it though.

It need not be a fine dining place..\n\nOver the last 2+ years all I have seen in Karachi are different trends.. One person dares challenge Pizza Hut with a new very different offering and it becomes a hit among us 'the foodies'.. Next few weeks we see the numerous pizza places open up.. some are good some are OK but after a few weeks they all taste the same.. Then came the thin crust era (No offence to anyone I totally love Domino's Thin Crust pizza)  and everyone from Domino's and bakeries and cafe selling the thin crust..\n\nWhile everyone was enjoying the 20 inches pizza, Hardees came to town.. There again began this trend of selling burgers.. And its still ongoing..Everyday there is a new place advertising themselves..\n\nIs there any place in Karachi that offers something other than burgers and pizza and pasta which tastes good too... I don't mind having sea food or steaks (No Arizona or Roasters pls) but something that would just end this monotony in the food choices we have (or rather I have) in this city..\n\nI know some of you would say there is BOTS ( Love the food there), Ghaffar, Log Inn Lounge(Chapli Kebabs are awesome) and so on.. But really need some innovation something new and that can actually get someone hooked on to the place.. \n\nA few years ago there was this little cafe at Karsaz called Alao.. It used to have a great sandwich and very very good cold coffee.. It was a very quiet place yet I have not been able to find the same taste since it closed down..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-13T19:55:12+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-14T07:32:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002623239897","name":"Ezzy Irfan Izhar"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE2NTgyNjY2","before":"MTAwMDAyNjIzMjM5ODk3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"649509475100206","from":{"name":"Vishal Preetam","id":"1781512632"},"message":"burns road (Y)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-13T20:35:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"649513738433113","from":{"name":"Ammar Habib Khan","id":"685505866"},"message":"Rowtisserie.

It offers the usual, seen-everywhere range of products like tonnes of different varieties of rolls, and burgers and BBQ etc. but what I would want the SWOT-members from that area to give a try is their Masala Broast.\nIt's your usual quarter-chicken broast, with a twist. They smother the regular chicken broast pieces with some spicy (and quite wet-ish) sauce of theirs. It \"looks\" sloppy, but tastes super good!\nA definite must-try.\nMy usual take on it is to grab a float from Dip Shop, or a shake from Hav Mor and then sit at Crescent and order this Masala Broast, and it's a complete, satisfying meal.

Well done OPTP!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-30T05:46:44+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-02T06:22:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"1191222645","name":"M.safdar Murad"},{"id":"592317993","name":"Muhammad Adil"},{"id":"516407498","name":"Shah Qureshi"},{"id":"734228975","name":"Rizwan Mustafa Yusuf"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"552035321","name":"Aamir Shaikh"},{"id":"648921043","name":"Fahad Dawach"},{"id":"515342891","name":"Faizan Munaf"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"641225588","name":"Sarah Akber"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"605016788","name":"Neha Makhdoom"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"571594364","name":"Abdullah Ahmed Muhammad"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"627817873","name":"Ayishah Sohail Siddiqui"},{"id":"654816277","name":"Farrukh Shabbir."},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"574028031","name":"Shiraz Qureshi"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"100001514926283","name":"Acif Hasan Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNTE0OTI2Mjgz","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc0MDgxMjMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"626398770744610","from":{"name":"Shiraz Qureshi","id":"574028031"},"message":"optp is probably the best fast food available in the country. and above all its an absolute local chain. kudos to the brand !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T05:56:03+0000","like_count":10,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626415370742950","from":{"name":"Haris Shaikh","id":"694723124"},"message":"had one yesternight aswell :) its awesome","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T07:01:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626420197409134","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"also opened in Dubai few months ago & doing good sales.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T07:21:16+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626421577408996","from":{"name":"Saeed Jamal Tariq","id":"100000444703801"},"message":"Change coming ?

Its just amazing how Mr Big with Egg n Cheese is perfect every time . It feels like they have time frozen the entire process for the last 20 years . Succulent , Flavoursome , Juicy Satisfaction all wrapped up in One little Piece of Heaven. I'd rate it 12/10 , 2 extra points for that smile on my face every time I take the first bite.\n\n2- Al Asif Square : Though a bit risky for some fellows but to be honest the place was packed . We had food at MADINA RESTAURANT which is located inside Al Asif Square and to some people's surprise there were few families around there as well ( well to do families at that ) enjoying food , the atmosphere was friendly we were greeted as warmly as always . We had the famous Dumba Boti , Afghani Pulao , Namkeen Gosht and Karahi.  Now i don't want to waste time in describing the brilliance of food . \nThat is the best Authentic Afghani food out there, Period , 11/10 . One extra point for the Afghan brethren for their every gracious hospitality. \n\n3- Tayyabi Restaurant : Located in Hussainabad. It one of the few unsung heroes of Karachi. We ordered Prawn Masala , KataKat , Chicken Chargha Fry, Malai Boti and Tikkas . Food was served a bit late as they prepare all the dishes fresh and from the scratch. \nPrawn Masala is one of the best in town as the prawns just melt in your mouth and mix with that zesty masala . THE DAMN ! \n\nKatakat and Chicken Chargha fry are good too . All in all yet another place you wont come out unsatisfied or cheated, EVER . 8/10 . -2 for the stolen side mirror of my friend's car from the parking :P\n\n4-  The Burger Shack: I have Shake Shack every week so it did not impressed me much. But i'd like to commend the owner for doing the best damn possible thing by cloning a famous international franchise's menu and making it possible to offer taste in it as well. I was not disappointed to say the least. 7/10\n\n5- Cafeela : Simply put , Zahoor bhai you rock . Okra Jalfarezi , Malai Boti , Nathiya Gali Qeema , Shahi Tukray , Chicken Yakhni Pulao are all yum. One of the best value for money in town. \n\nI am a safe eater and a Desi at heart as I get to eat really yummy mum cooked food and these are few of the places I go to eat or get food delivered when I want to eat out. Flying out tonight . Will Miss Karachi as I always do . Tada !","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-25T12:11:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-27T10:31:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"644528865","name":"Shirin Imani"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"647407601","name":"Syeda Rizvi"},{"id":"655910358","name":"Moiz Kazmi"},{"id":"549477264","name":"Junaid Wasti"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"1521133249","name":"Maouz Qazi"},{"id":"504239316","name":"Hala Qureshi"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"591166408","name":"Faisal M.

There are four types of pizza.  The fancy ultra thin crust 'authentic' pizza baked in a brick oven, with some olives, and just a bit of rosemary on top.  The international franchise pizza, which is either loaded with oil, or majorly lacks consistency.  There is the me-too pizza.  And then there is Miss Hen, serving the classic desi-ized version of pizza, loaded with cheese and your choice of meat.  No nonsense.  Just a delicious pizza, probably the best around if one is looking for that greasy pizza full of flavor.  Lets call it the Johari Deep Pan.\n\nMost would not be aware of Miss Hen, unless they have spent some time at the IBA Main Campus, or live in NA-253.  The pizza just has insane amount of topping, and is full of flavor.  It may not be the most pleasant looking pizza, but tastes bloody amazing, and beats any of these available fancy pizzas by a mile, at a fraction of cost.\n\nHighly Recommended for those who are willing to experiment.\n\nOverall Rating -- 8.5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-13T20:54:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-14T12:55:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"777000220","name":"Ata Ur Rehman"},{"id":"513059748","name":"Tracy Roque"},{"id":"519570353","name":"Khushboo Zahra"},{"id":"100003533323814","name":"Sarah Muhammad"},{"id":"546027973","name":"Abdul Ahad Saud"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1547568629","name":"Danish Khan"},{"id":"100001177844959","name":"Sameer Siddiqui"},{"id":"838344921","name":"Wajeeh Hasan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"591166408","name":"Faisal M.

There are four types of pizza.  The fancy ultra thin crust 'authentic' pizza baked in a brick oven, with some olives, and just a bit of rosemary on top.  The international franchise pizza, which is either loaded with oil, or majorly lacks consistency.  There is the me-too pizza.  And then there is Miss Hen, serving the classic desi-ized version of pizza, loaded with cheese and your choice of meat.  No nonsense.  Just a delicious pizza, probably the best around if one is looking for that greasy pizza full of flavor.  Lets call it the Johari Deep Pan.\n\nMost would not be aware of Miss Hen, unless they have spent some time at the IBA Main Campus, or live in NA-253.  The pizza just has insane amount of topping, and is full of flavor.  It may not be the most pleasant looking pizza, but tastes bloody amazing, and beats any of these available fancy pizzas by a mile, at a fraction of cost.\n\nHighly Recommended for those who are willing to experiment.\n\nOverall Rating -- 8.5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-13T20:54:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-14T12:55:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"777000220","name":"Ata Ur Rehman"},{"id":"513059748","name":"Tracy Roque"},{"id":"519570353","name":"Khushboo Zahra"},{"id":"100003533323814","name":"Sarah Muhammad"},{"id":"546027973","name":"Abdul Ahad Saud"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1547568629","name":"Danish Khan"},{"id":"100001177844959","name":"Sameer Siddiqui"},{"id":"838344921","name":"Wajeeh Hasan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"591166408","name":"Faisal M.

Originally my family and I wanted to go and have sehri at bbq tonight but there was a 20-30 minute waiting and since it was already like 3 in the am we decided against it. Ended up going to boat basin and the family members wanted to have handi/saalan type food we ended up going to Nihari Inn. I, personally was not fond of this place as is because I had gotten food poisoning the first time I ate here which was around 6 years ago. But the second experience was the cherry on top. Ordered the boneless chicken handi which tasted like chicken karahi..when we asked the waiter he said it was chicken karahi cooked in a handi.. Then we asked the manager and HE said it was infact chicken handi cooked in a karahi! Wth? Ordered the dhaaga wala kabab.. Which i didnt have because I dont like it. But according to my family it was good. Ordered plain nan and when I asked for garlic naan the manager was like we dont have that here.. Dude how hard is it to make garlic naan?? And I ordered the boneless chicken boti. The boti was ok but too spicy and there was no salad with it. The dhaga wala kabab didnt have salad either..upon enquiry we were told that the salad was infact the bowl of onions on our table and that too for both of our dishes COMBINED. When the waiter asked for drinks I ordered pepsi and he told us sorry sir pepsi thandi nahi hai but I let that go and ordered a mountain dew. Aaaaaand that wasnt cold either -_- Never going back there again!

PATHETIC with a capital P. I did tag the damn location but it didn't appear here :( and neither did my cute emoticon :p\n\nKher. Firstly, it was the 10th iftar yesterday so there should not have been the problems that occurred yesterday, The menu was chicken in sticky red sauce, manchurian, fish tamarind, beef chilli gravy and vegetable rice. \n\nWe were the 1st ones to arrive...around 630ish. The place is tiny and cosy in the first look. The wall and ceiling look cool. Every and I mean EVERY single chinese place I have been to has the soya sauce, vinegar with chillies and red chilli sauce but not at Lantern. Anyways. the place was houseful by iftar time and even the tables outside were filled. We thought its a promising sign. \n\nIftar platters were placed with literally miskeen looking drumsticks. They had ZERO salt in them so all went back. The chicken meatball thingys were consumed by 1 of us, the other 4 didnt like the hardness and no-taste fact. The only saving grace were the fried wontons. Missed GD a lot at tht time. \n\nOh there was no TV, no announcement - nothing about the iftar time. AND no arrangement for prayers for ladies. The server had very conveniently informed us that u can go pray with the men in the garden and we were like  ----\u003e :o\n\nOk, then a server comes and takes our order of soup. Options: Hot n Sour Red and white. We ordered both. All I'll say about the soups is that usually the red chilli sauce and vinegar and soya sauce makes the worst of soups consumable. BUT not Lantern. Firstly the sauces came when the soups got cold...and they were the most bland and horrible tasting soups I have tasted. I mean places like Karachi Broast and Chips have served me with better tasting soups.\n\nWe asked the server can we eat coz it was 8 already. (There were 2 tables who were still asking for their soups at 8...poor souls). He said yes and when we reached, all the silver thingys were empty. 2 minutes later, the food (labelled on the silver lids) came but was incorrectly placed and a lot of food was spilled all over the table. I swear I felt like I was in some shadi hall at that time.\n\nNot too much of a fish person, I took the other 3 things. The Beef Chilli Gravy, like the soups were bland and utterly disappointing. The chicken in red sticky sauce had to be cut with steak knives. The sauce was just ok. Not worth the calories. The Manchurian was nice. Thank God, I could at least eat SOMETHING from the table. When I went for the second round, none of the dishes had meat in them and no one had bothered to check.\n\nThe operations manager had apologized for the mishaps saying today everything was going wrong. Well, after paying 970 per head, not even 1 of us wanted to give them any benefit of doubt. The comment card was photocopied with stuff doodled behind it. Gave them a very honest review and wished them the best of luck in the future as the 5 of us wont be going back at least. \n\nWORST IFTAR EXPERIENCE. \n\nOne day before iftar at Nandos was SUPERB. Pics and review following. I will just stick to my favorites next time for iftar that are at least worth it after 14+ hours of fasting.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T19:05:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589805244403963","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"when she said detailed review she was NOT kidding!!!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T19:09:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589805287737292","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"i will read this by Eid and get back","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T19:09:39+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589805711070583","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"I'll skip it probably.....too much detail.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T19:11:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589805954403892","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Sure Nez.

The ambiance was good as ever however the food was a major let down. First the positives, the humus and flafel are one of the best in town and my friends loved it more than BBQ tonights hummus. The main course however was Spicy Cheese Broast, Double Beef Burger Delight, Chicken Delux Burger and drinks. It was a big let down to see the fries (all of them) literally overcooked and dripping with oil, the broast was a sorry state of oil on top. The beef burger was an absolute delight to eat however the remaining food quality was very poor. I got embarrased infront of my friends as I had suggested the place to them. Price is not an issue, quality of food is. I know they are better known for their BBQ items but still whats on the menu should be of good standard.

Her husband Asim and my broast was perfect, crispy, hot and delicious till the last bite. Even the sauces are perfect.\n\nSo, the food is the same...you must be thinking, what's different. Well, the fact that this place lives up to the PG level and has taken KB to a very 'cool' level is what is different. I was pleasantly surprised by the adorable bright orange interior, very comfortable seating, the color theme, the brick wall, the tissue and toothpick holder, the cutlery used....it has raised the standards of KB and made it a notch more awesome.\n\nVisit KB at PG asap....before the wind loses the chill in the air! \n\nBest of luck Sameer Beg and thank you.

Golden Dragon - My new love for Thai and Chinese food. Hot favourites: American Chopsuey, Crispy Beef, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Hot and Sour Soup, Thai Soup, Thai Green Curry, Wontons, Zingers and Chicken Karhai (the last two from their Lunch Xpress section)\n\n2. Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb's warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I'm not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away.

Ambiance, I don't really care much for. \n\n1) BOTS: With over 200 dishes. It caters to my Chinese, Seafood, Bbq fixes all under ONE roof, What more can one ask for? \n2) GHAFFAR KABAB HOUSE: One place a food lover can never leave dissapointed. \n3) HARDEES: If I could eat one thing all day everyday. It would be a GREAT beef n cheese burger. And for me the Hardees Superstar is the best Beef Cheese karachi has to offer. As good as it is, the other burgers are equally as bad. \n4) XANDERS: Fried Calamari, Clasic Beef Cheese Burger & New York Cheese Cake 'nuff said. \n5) JAVED NIHARI: Regular Swotties know me for being a desi food fanatic. And it doesn't get any desier than Javed Nihari. Best Nihari in Karachi.  \n6) AGHA SAJJI HOUSE : This is just for my katakat fix. Beats all katakat places I've ever had. And I've had katakat at more than a dozen places atleast. \n7) DONISL : My second favorite Kakakat joint, used to be my first. Quality has gone down. \n8) CAFE BLUE GINGER: Beef In Oyster Sauce. FTW!!\n9) MADNI BIRYANI: My favorite biryani. Sometimes consistency issues, but still the best biryani which has top quality chawal unlike others. \n10) KUNDAN BROAST: With a different broast waala on every street corner, standing out takes hard work.
