Their soups esp Hot and Sour is the best. Nicely done with cheese and chicken chunks with brilliant tangy flavor to get your stomach going for the upcoming hot steamy main course. We ordered American Chopsuey with prawns, Chicken Tom Yum gravy and Sichuan Chicken with Fried Rice. All were delicious except for Tom Yum which is a little bland in taste so if you are up for a spicy gravy the sichuan would balance that. Afterwards for desert and tea we hit the evergreen Hobnob Cafe, Zamzama. There we had the chocolate ice cream goblet with loads of chocolate chips in it- the Lipsmacker. A little less of choc chips would have been fine. the other desert was Cant Say No- a brownie ice cream combo with walnuts. but the winner was their Doodh Patti that always gives a nice end to a meal.

Not to mention tea, coffee, white rice, bread basket etc!\nThe food was cold and the taste was average nothing which would make u want to go back for seconds...the pasta sauce was thick and had dried up..fish was confusing..mustard chicken was half decent but then again it was a basic mustard sauce! The menu mentioned soup (number 9) but it wasn't at the buffet table when I asked a waiter to get it for me I could hear his conversation with the chef when he asked him for the soup. Chef \"kon as soup?\" waiter \"menu wala\" chef \"kon maang raha hai?\" waiter \"customer\" pointing at me.. The the chef took out a tub and heat some for me which tasted like daal without the tarka blended in to a paste..\nStuffed chicken with spinach was dry and tasteless and the steak kind tough...\nOh and water, number 19 was not to be seen, so I asked for that too...\nIn a nutshell the only nice thing was the French toast which I don't think is worth paying 1275pkr...
