The rice were good but the gravy didn't taste good at all.\n\nGenrals Chicken: I personally liked it more then the Manchurian.\n\nChicken Chilli Dry: too spicy for me to taste or review. According to the friend she has tasted better ones.\n\nChowmein : was tasteless. I mean it's noodles how can they go wrong with NOODLES... \n\n\nOverall:\nThe quantity was very poor.\nAnd very average taste.\nBut since I was very hungry and.they have good customer service I'd give them a 6.5.\n\nWill I go again.

We ordered American Chopsuey with prawns, Chicken Tom Yum gravy and Sichuan Chicken with Fried Rice. All were delicious except for Tom Yum which is a little bland in taste so if you are up for a spicy gravy the sichuan would balance that. Afterwards for desert and tea we hit the evergreen Hobnob Cafe, Zamzama. There we had the chocolate ice cream goblet with loads of chocolate chips in it- the Lipsmacker. A little less of choc chips would have been fine. the other desert was Cant Say No- a brownie ice cream combo with walnuts. but the winner was their Doodh Patti that always gives a nice end to a meal.

Cutlery was missing (even though table was reserved in advance), the place ran out of napkins, no one bothered taking order for drinks (despite reminders), and it took at least twenty minutes before water was finally served (after repeated reminders).  \n\nSoup was served 30 minutes after the order was placed, while the rest of the dishes were served after a solid wait of 50 minutes.  Even then there were order mix-ups, and the staff just wasn't aware of what's happening.  And like always, the excuse was the typical old school one, 'sir aaj rush zyada hai...' -- fair enough.  \n\nThe food is typical Desi-fied Chinese, and hence it doesn't really have any distinct flavor.  Tried the Chicken Schezwan Soup, Fish in Tamarind Sauce, Mixed Fried Rice, Beef Chili Chowmein, and the Sichuan Chicken.  Nothing special about the flavor of any entree.  The serving sizes were massive, making it a favored choice for a value seeker.  With per head cost of roughly PKR500, Red Emperor is a pretty reasonable Desi Chinese option.\n\nThe service is a major bummer, and the food is just fine -- nothing special about it.  The place doesn't really have any differentiating factor, and is equally good (or bad) as Ginsory, or Jade Garden.\n\nNot recommended if one is looking for a smooth flavorful dinner experience.\n\nOverall Rating -- 6/10\n\nOn a side note -- the lightning at the place is just too dim, making going over the menu, and the bill, an arduous task.  I like to see my food -- why can't certain restaurants be more brighter!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-15T00:26:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-15T12:51:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"646760193","name":"Rehma Tirmizey"},{"id":"556911379","name":"Shaheer Hassan"},{"id":"769030393","name":"Muhammad Danniyal Jafri"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"1560344939","name":"Zahid Qureshi"},{"id":"1488962130","name":"Zulfiqar Ali"},{"id":"100001207576659","name":"Faisal Rafiq"},{"id":"100005945647613","name":"Sara H Khan"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"832750315","name":"Romano Karim Yusuf"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"873280323","name":"Umair Zia"},{"id":"801035182","name":"Asad Kamran"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"512542175","name":"Nabiya Fahad Khan"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"684094046","name":"Faiza Hasan"},{"id":"1346742308","name":"Ijlal Malik"},{"id":"1191501552","name":"Ali Majeed S T"},{"id":"561575202","name":"Usuf Haroon"},{"id":"647940246","name":"Maheen Khan Omair"},{"id":"523153232","name":"Hira Humayun"},{"id":"757255502","name":"Faryal Naeem Warind"},{"id":"502333997","name":"Annie Adnan Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAyMzMzOTk3","before":"NjQ2NzYwMTkz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_603313529719801/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTAyMzMzOTk3"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"603412379709916","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Great review once again.

Golden Dragon - My new love for Thai and Chinese food. Hot favourites: American Chopsuey, Crispy Beef, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Hot and Sour Soup, Thai Soup, Thai Green Curry, Wontons, Zingers and Chicken Karhai (the last two from their Lunch Xpress section)\n\n2. Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb's warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I'm not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away. Will go soon to be blown away by other things too.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-25T18:59:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-27T14:47:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"505164013","name":"Yasmeen Agad-Kothawala"},{"id":"515396294","name":"Danish Ali Dahraj"},{"id":"100003249618202","name":"Heer Ahmed"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"500907007","name":"Murtaza Moiz"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNjUxNzIy","before":"NjU3MDMxNzQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"404073356310487","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"i see myself featured here too, obliged and humbled Hajra Amir","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T19:33:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir","type":"user","offset":52,"length":10}]},{"id":"404123489638807","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Thank you Hajra :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T21:13:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra","type":"user","offset":10,"length":5}]},{"id":"404386042945885","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"These places are on my fingertips 24/7!!!
