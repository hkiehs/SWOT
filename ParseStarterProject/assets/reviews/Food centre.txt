Being a vegetarian most of my life, I usually avoided fast food and fried chicken, in leau of fresh salad and vegetables. I tried several restaurants but none were able to replicate that authentic western food feel with the garden aroma. \n\nI had decided since this morning that I'd be trying something new instead of my usual pick (Golden Dragon, Food centre, Mr. Burger) etc. Then I found this group called San-which? which was a food restaurant. The food looked good enough in the pictures but I was still not sure. I posted for reviews here and seeing that this \"San-which\" was approved by our big boss Nezihe Hussain, I gave it a shot. I ordered the greek salad through Urbanite at 8:15 pm, I was given a call at 9:45 pm that the rider had the wrong address and will be at my place in 20 minutes. The rider reached at 10:15 pm, apologizing and compensating me with a delicious Ice cream by Lal's. A good start ;)\n\nThe packaging and the presentation was perfect! As soon as I opened it, I could smell that similar garden aroma fragrance that was sweet tomato's key point gainer. I immediately realized the search is over. I've finally found the taste I had been looking for. Everything was perfect! The quantity, the quality, top class ingredients. It was just delicious. I could taste each and every ingredient that it consisted of, from the sun riped tomatoes to the black olives to the feta, that how different it was to the traditional stuff, how high quality it was compared to any other thing I have eaten recently, including subway or the traditional gyros.\n\nMy food experience of San-which: 9/10. I never give full marks because in my opinion there is always room for improvement, but this little outlet has just won my taste buds, and will surely be my go to place besides golden dragon from now ownwards.\n\nI usually never write such big reviews on food experiences unless its a bad one, or upload pictures of the food I am about to consume. Infact, I hate the habit. But this one deserves it.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-07-23T18:07:02+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-24T08:06:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1566590707","name":"Zainab Quli"},{"id":"100004102427163","name":"Malyha Shuja"},{"id":"100000126232501","name":"Habib Hashim Pal"},{"id":"628998190","name":"Shahvez Fazail"},{"id":"100001857259546","name":"Umer Awan"},{"id":"100000547472472","name":"Hasan Khan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1707529920","name":"Amna Tariq"},{"id":"612550201","name":"Muhammad Furqan"},{"id":"595581062","name":"Asma Saiyed"},{"id":"100005558611444","name":"Rana Arslan"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"602924593","name":"Aneeta Nasir"},{"id":"100000155371840","name":"Sabih Kirmani"},{"id":"520882045","name":"Ghulam Ali"},{"id":"1071636036","name":"Syeda Javeria Hassan"},{"id":"750786806","name":"Faixa Shah"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"584105847","name":"Sabin Jawed"},{"id":"586610094","name":"Sara Omar"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"100004544739993","name":"Anum Shafi"},{"id":"547996286","name":"Shahzaib Javaid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQ3OTk2Mjg2","before":"MTU2NjU5MDcwNw\u003d\u003d"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_591230300928124/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTQ3OTk2Mjg2"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"591230560928098","from":{"name":"Shahbaz Lalani","id":"100000311538556"},"message":"P.S Don't mind the bed sheet on the right side, I am too lazy to have my food on the dinner table.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T18:08:06+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591242360926918","from":{"name":"Zubair Azmat","id":"844086066"},"message":"How did you know about the food before consuming it that its worth taking a picture of. :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T18:42:09+0000","like_count":12,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591249600926194","from":{"name":"Faizan Mukarram","id":"1023815310"},"message":"It must have been the love at first sight wala scene :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T19:00:06+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591256954258792","from":{"name":"Shahbaz Lalani","id":"100000311538556"},"message":"Lol its a yahoodi sazish :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T19:23:30+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591259294258558","from":{"name":"Hafsa Azhar","id":"543845188"},"message":"^oppxxzz...!! :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T19:28:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591262827591538","from":{"name":"Anum Zainab","id":"100000073259186"},"message":"Me three :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T19:41:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591309677586853","from":{"name":"Mariam Lary","id":"1089603658"},"message":"where is this outlet?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T21:49:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591375824246905","from":{"name":"Mostafa Mo","id":"1684751893"},"message":"I Am Sorry But Is This A Niswaar Kii Puriyah Besides The Paper Glass ???","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T23:31:23+0000","like_count":9,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591419824242505","from":{"name":"Sania Lakhani","id":"1667656022"},"message":"^^LOL...I think it's chutney","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-24T01:06:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591474557570365","from":{"name":"Saroasha Eng","id":"508588993"},"message":"I loveeeeeee sweet tomatoes.

Most of them are not local. We ordered Mutton Biryani, Chicken Handi and Lab-e-Shireen from Food Centre and Kunna from Advance Food Centre at Phase 2 (as recommended by some of the hub's friends). For biryani and Kunna, we provided the meat for these 2 dishes. \n\nFood centre guy told us that they will cook 7kg of meat and 5kg of rice for our guests of about 50 people (adults + children), 4kg Chicken Handi and 4kg Lab-e-Shireen. As for Kunna, we ordered a 5kg one.\n\nI am happy to mention here that Food Centre and Advance Food Centre did a really good job. The biryani was so delicious with just the right taste of spices, not too spicy and it just got that \"kick\" when u eat it, everyone was praising it and some even asked me for their contact no. Chicken Handi was a hit too and not forgetting the dessert, which was also whipped up in no time.
