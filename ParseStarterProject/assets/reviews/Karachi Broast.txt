It surely gave my chicken wingssss... \n\nOk so we ordered 1 Zinger, 1 Beef burger with cheese, for our two outcasts :p \nAnd countless Qtr. Broasts (i lost count after the first 6)\n\nZinger: It looked appetising, amazing size good value for money. And by the look of the empty devoured plate in the end im pretty sure It was well enjoyed.\n\nBeef Burger with Cheese:\nOrdered by our second non brostie.\nUpon asking hi the rating went like \nIt was great..good.. Average tha..\nSo if u are trying to compare it to the BK ka whooper like we initially were trying to do, look the other way :p\n\nThe fried chickies aka Karachi ka Broast.\nThe first look: Defiantly huge portions.\nToo much on the oily side.\nThe fries looked like dead dried fishes. \nTaste: according to one fellow foodie the wings tasted like buffalo wings (i wouldnt know i fed mine to the kitties) \n\nPs: the fresh lime i ordered was nimbo pani with an over load of kali mirch.. Yeekkhh \n\n \nOverall:\nHad an average taste, very average nothing to rave about. All the hype is defiantly over rated.    \nService was very sad, one waiter running around the whole floor.\nWill not be going again for the food.\nBut then again the prices were dirt cheap so i wouldnt expect anything else. \n\nALSO after all that being said.\nAll those people who care about hygiene should avoide. \nThe place is crawling with cats. \nEven though i am well. But two of our members fell sick as soon as they reached home. Which is unacceptable.There was something seriously wrong with the chicken. So i think a visit from the health inspectors is due to that place.  \nUntil that i think im staying away.\n\nLast but not the least.\nThankyou everyone who joined us. Was a pleasure meeting you guys. :) \nHope to see you guys again real soon.\n\n*An invader from Foodies Food Invasions*","type":"photo","created_time":"2014-01-05T15:13:51+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-10T21:02:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000595182709","name":"Umair Chaudhry UC"},{"id":"100000605712128","name":"Kashif Jakhrani"},{"id":"100001971013076","name":"Zohaib Hassan"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"816865264","name":"Muhammad Arsalan Siddiqui"},{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"873280323","name":"Umair Zia"},{"id":"100001542765153","name":"Umair Zahid"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"100000107764417","name":"M Kashif Malik"},{"id":"1224016566","name":"Asif Rasheed Ghani"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"100002154180249","name":"Afifa J Maniar"},{"id":"617393721","name":"Ali Sheheryar Khan"},{"id":"100001075455207","name":"Ahsan Ahmed"},{"id":"568465423","name":"Yasir Hasan"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"1236316260","name":"Taimoor Nadeem"},{"id":"669320704","name":"Fahad Azad"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"742775803","name":"Nabeel Islam"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"517581738","name":"Armughan Ahmed Faruqi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3NTgxNzM4","before":"MTAwMDAwNTk1MTgyNzA5"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_677950858922734/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTE3NTgxNzM4"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"677952425589244","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Thats the branch i got a tharki roach from, lin marofying on my food with his rather wiggly antennae! :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:17:48+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677952932255860","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"We missed u too Sohaaaa :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:18:59+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677953475589139","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"hahaha Me not tharki roach :p I m shadeedun shareefun :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:19:41+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677956665588820","from":{"name":"Syeda Wajeeha","id":"564340227"},"message":"Love there raita uff","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:26:25+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677957455588741","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Zaid Tehsin: ya sorry to burst ur bubble but they do and feel free not to read it though.

PATHETIC with a capital P. I did tag the damn location but it didn't appear here :( and neither did my cute emoticon :p\n\nKher. Firstly, it was the 10th iftar yesterday so there should not have been the problems that occurred yesterday, The menu was chicken in sticky red sauce, manchurian, fish tamarind, beef chilli gravy and vegetable rice. \n\nWe were the 1st ones to arrive...around 630ish. The place is tiny and cosy in the first look. The wall and ceiling look cool. Every and I mean EVERY single chinese place I have been to has the soya sauce, vinegar with chillies and red chilli sauce but not at Lantern. Anyways. the place was houseful by iftar time and even the tables outside were filled. We thought its a promising sign. \n\nIftar platters were placed with literally miskeen looking drumsticks. They had ZERO salt in them so all went back. The chicken meatball thingys were consumed by 1 of us, the other 4 didnt like the hardness and no-taste fact. The only saving grace were the fried wontons. Missed GD a lot at tht time. \n\nOh there was no TV, no announcement - nothing about the iftar time. AND no arrangement for prayers for ladies. The server had very conveniently informed us that u can go pray with the men in the garden and we were like  ----\u003e :o\n\nOk, then a server comes and takes our order of soup. Options: Hot n Sour Red and white. We ordered both. All I'll say about the soups is that usually the red chilli sauce and vinegar and soya sauce makes the worst of soups consumable. BUT not Lantern. Firstly the sauces came when the soups got cold...and they were the most bland and horrible tasting soups I have tasted. I mean places like Karachi Broast and Chips have served me with better tasting soups.\n\nWe asked the server can we eat coz it was 8 already. (There were 2 tables who were still asking for their soups at 8...poor souls). He said yes and when we reached, all the silver thingys were empty. 2 minutes later, the food (labelled on the silver lids) came but was incorrectly placed and a lot of food was spilled all over the table. I swear I felt like I was in some shadi hall at that time.\n\nNot too much of a fish person, I took the other 3 things. The Beef Chilli Gravy, like the soups were bland and utterly disappointing. The chicken in red sticky sauce had to be cut with steak knives. The sauce was just ok. Not worth the calories. The Manchurian was nice. Thank God, I could at least eat SOMETHING from the table. When I went for the second round, none of the dishes had meat in them and no one had bothered to check.\n\nThe operations manager had apologized for the mishaps saying today everything was going wrong. Well, after paying 970 per head, not even 1 of us wanted to give them any benefit of doubt. The comment card was photocopied with stuff doodled behind it.

And what it needed, it now even has that. Karachi Broast listened to my prayers and I now have my utmost favorite food in the world at my favorite place in Karachi.\n\nThe BEST part is you will get the broast EXACTLY how you have been having it at boat basin or near the bilawal house....My friend Qamarunnisa Asim had the zinger burger and the size of the burger is bigger than the ones at any of the former outlets. Her husband Asim and my broast was perfect, crispy, hot and delicious till the last bite. Even the sauces are perfect.\n\nSo, the food is the same...you must be thinking, what's different. Well, the fact that this place lives up to the PG level and has taken KB to a very 'cool' level is what is different. I was pleasantly surprised by the adorable bright orange interior, very comfortable seating, the color theme, the brick wall, the tissue and toothpick holder, the cutlery used....it has raised the standards of KB and made it a notch more awesome.\n\nVisit KB at PG asap....before the wind loses the chill in the air! \n\nBest of luck Sameer Beg and thank you. After Ghaffar, PG needed serious competition in terms of variety, value for money, consistent taste and just sheer joy of food.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-30T18:59:20+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-31T12:38:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"741385426","name":"Riaz Salim"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"501834092","name":"Fawaz Khan"},{"id":"514291165","name":"Taha Alavi"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTgzNDQ2OTQ4","before":"NzQxMzg1NDI2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"498200100231145","from":{"name":"Sameer Beg","id":"583446948"},"message":"Thank u Hajra!!!!

Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb's warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I'm not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away. Will go soon to be blown away by other things too.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-25T18:59:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-27T14:47:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"505164013","name":"Yasmeen Agad-Kothawala"},{"id":"515396294","name":"Danish Ali Dahraj"},{"id":"100003249618202","name":"Heer Ahmed"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"500907007","name":"Murtaza Moiz"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNjUxNzIy","before":"NjU3MDMxNzQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"404073356310487","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"i see myself featured here too, obliged and humbled Hajra Amir","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T19:33:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir","type":"user","offset":52,"length":10}]},{"id":"404123489638807","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Thank you Hajra :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T21:13:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra","type":"user","offset":10,"length":5}]},{"id":"404386042945885","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"These places are on my fingertips 24/7!!!

Ambiance, I don't really care much for. \n\n1) BOTS: With over 200 dishes. It caters to my Chinese, Seafood, Bbq fixes all under ONE roof, What more can one ask for? \n2) GHAFFAR KABAB HOUSE: One place a food lover can never leave dissapointed. \n3) HARDEES: If I could eat one thing all day everyday. It would be a GREAT beef n cheese burger. And for me the Hardees Superstar is the best Beef Cheese karachi has to offer. As good as it is, the other burgers are equally as bad. \n4) XANDERS: Fried Calamari, Clasic Beef Cheese Burger & New York Cheese Cake 'nuff said. \n5) JAVED NIHARI: Regular Swotties know me for being a desi food fanatic. And it doesn't get any desier than Javed Nihari. Best Nihari in Karachi.  \n6) AGHA SAJJI HOUSE : This is just for my katakat fix. Beats all katakat places I've ever had. And I've had katakat at more than a dozen places atleast. \n7) DONISL : My second favorite Kakakat joint, used to be my first. Quality has gone down. \n8) CAFE BLUE GINGER: Beef In Oyster Sauce. FTW!!\n9) MADNI BIRYANI: My favorite biryani. Sometimes consistency issues, but still the best biryani which has top quality chawal unlike others. \n10) KUNDAN BROAST: With a different broast waala on every street corner, standing out takes hard work. And stand out, Kundan does. \n\nNotable Mentions : \nTUC : RVC\nCakery: Cheesecakes, Cheesecakes and Cheesecakes\nChips: Beef Cheese. \nKarachi Broast: Love their Dry shashlik with the special hot sauce.\nBADAL PAN SHOP: For a must Raja Sahab after dining out experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-30T05:43:03+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-30T10:59:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"581895987","name":"Emane Haque"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"531710313","name":"Aly Raza"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE5MjM1ODcz","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"388889521162204","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"Badal Pan Shop? the one on five star chowrangi? behind babulilm?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-30T06:41:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"388891964495293","from":{"name":"Danial Rizvi","id":"726690443"},"message":"Yeah","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-30T06:46:46+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"388921331159023","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"sdcr: ghaffar is my all time favour and so is agha sajji house.
