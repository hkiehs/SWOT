Early dinner at SattarBuksh with friends, and we were able to find space easily at 1930hrs.  Wanted to sit outside, but apparently, one requires to order Sheesha for that -- and none of us fancied smoking water.\n\nThe place suffers from an identity crisis, as it tries to make the traditional 'dhaba' feel more upscale.  The names of various items on the menu are well thought-out -- but it is really annoying to read Urdu in Roman Script.  Developing a menu purely in Urdu would have been an excellent initiative -- but I doubt majority of the patrons of the place would be comfortable with it.  The playlist of the place, was as confusing as the place itself.\n\nOrdered the 'Besharam Bun Kebab', and it was besharam, beghairat, and behooda at the same time.  It was completely bland, and as a friend remarked, \"it can serve as the perfect meal for someone who has just had Endoscopy, and needs to avoid food with spices, flavor, et al\".  Basically, a bun kebab for those who are unwell.  \n\nCan't really figure how difficult it is for SattarBuksh to prepare a decent bun kebab -- just hire the guy who stands opposite Uzma Arcade, and sell the PKR50 Anda Shami for PKR500.  Seriously, if people are willing to pay a top buck for the hospital burger -- they will be delighted to get some flavor with it as well.\n\nThe Roast Beef Burger was pretty much a disaster as well.  The meat was done well, but it was too damn salty.  All one could taste in the burger was salt, and nothing else.  Again -- these guys need to hire the guy who cooks the stuff at CHIPS and sells it for half the price.  If you're charging a top buck for a basic item, at least get the flavor right!\n\nThe Panini Sandwich was as dry as dust.  Nothing special about it.  Just a panini, and some dry chicken.  One can make a better Panini Sandwich at home at one-tenth the cost.  Again -- it had absolutely no flavor, only some chunks of chicken.\n\nI ordered an Iced Mocha, and that was the saving grace -- and it tasted perfect in that cheap IKEA glass.  The Apple Cinnamon tea also had a really nice fragrance, and was much better than other teas served in the city.  The mooch -- well, not really interested in a Movember moment.\n\nThe only good thing about the place is that it served Ben & Jerry's Strawberry Cheesecake Ice cream, which tastes awesome regardless of geographic location.\n\nA fancy place with an identity crisis, serving food straight from a hospital cafeteria.\n\nOverall Rating -- 5/10.\n\nP.S. Will go again, only for the Iced Mocha.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-03T20:59:31+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-04T16:41:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"841465178","name":"Sabika Raza"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"508081630","name":"Maha Anwar"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"593431153","name":"Rabia Aftab"},{"id":"838812489","name":"Saad Baig"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"559881298","name":"Nadia Mahasin"},{"id":"549655574","name":"Nazish Huda"},{"id":"100003573879421","name":"Samina Lotia"},{"id":"524535198","name":"Syed Sarmad Hasan"},{"id":"514440277","name":"M?ri?

The menu was Beef Lasagna w/garlic bread, Chicken Tarragon, Penne Arrabiata, Fish & Chips, Ice cream for dessert and cold drinks. Everything was prepared wonderfully well and compliments were abundant for all the dishes. It is hard to please teenagers and faculty alike when it comes to food but everyone was unequivocal in their praise. The food was served on time and despite the great appetites involved, there was more than enough to go around and then some! Thank you Imran and the Pizzo staff, as well as to Omar Jafar for helping me to pick the right menu and coming in on budget. You can count on our recommendation to anyone looking to host an event and repeat business from Southshore!

Being a vegetarian most of my life, I usually avoided fast food and fried chicken, in leau of fresh salad and vegetables. I tried several restaurants but none were able to replicate that authentic western food feel with the garden aroma. \n\nI had decided since this morning that I'd be trying something new instead of my usual pick (Golden Dragon, Food centre, Mr. Burger) etc. Then I found this group called San-which? which was a food restaurant. The food looked good enough in the pictures but I was still not sure. I posted for reviews here and seeing that this \"San-which\" was approved by our big boss Nezihe Hussain, I gave it a shot. I ordered the greek salad through Urbanite at 8:15 pm, I was given a call at 9:45 pm that the rider had the wrong address and will be at my place in 20 minutes. The rider reached at 10:15 pm, apologizing and compensating me with a delicious Ice cream by Lal's. A good start ;)\n\nThe packaging and the presentation was perfect! As soon as I opened it, I could smell that similar garden aroma fragrance that was sweet tomato's key point gainer. I immediately realized the search is over. I've finally found the taste I had been looking for. Everything was perfect! The quantity, the quality, top class ingredients. It was just delicious. I could taste each and every ingredient that it consisted of, from the sun riped tomatoes to the black olives to the feta, that how different it was to the traditional stuff, how high quality it was compared to any other thing I have eaten recently, including subway or the traditional gyros.\n\nMy food experience of San-which: 9/10. I never give full marks because in my opinion there is always room for improvement, but this little outlet has just won my taste buds, and will surely be my go to place besides golden dragon from now ownwards.\n\nI usually never write such big reviews on food experiences unless its a bad one, or upload pictures of the food I am about to consume. Infact, I hate the habit.

We reached there around 2:30 and the place had quite a lot of people sitting. The ambiance at all the places on the strip is to die for esp at this hour. Anyways Ordered a Mushroom steak, friend ordered Kabuli pulao and malai boti, and vanilla and pistachio ice cream for dessert. \n\nThe Mushroom Steak: I initially wanted to order chicken tarragon but they DONOT have that on their menu so had to resort to a mushroom one. The steak was cooked to perfection just as I like it, the sauce also tasted good. They could have improved the presentation a bit, but taste made up for it.\n\nThe Kabuli pulao: Tasted amazing. Didn't try much of it though. \n\nMalai boti: was really good and soft. \n\nIce creams were similar to the ones I had at Peshawari Ice cream so if that's what you are looking you will like them.\n\nOver all: service was excellent. Very cooperative staff. Satisfying portions. They can try and improve their presentation, but what lacked there was made up by taste and ambiance. Would highly recommend for bar b q and desi items during sehri rather then steaks. Very happy with my experience. Will defiantly go again before Ramadan ends.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-07-19T23:31:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-20T10:05:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"688800233","name":"Arhama Kamal"},{"id":"100002756090051","name":"Niha Jawaid"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"1311140673","name":"Yumna Salvatore"},{"id":"735591219","name":"Ch Arslan Khalid"},{"id":"100005306882506","name":"Anisa Ahmed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"1586595597","name":"Khurram Iqbal"},{"id":"1368416951","name":"Muhammad Jamal"},{"id":"571357266","name":"Khurram Zameer"},{"id":"100000579235439","name":"Halima Mobin"},{"id":"1429600174","name":"Shumail Ahmad"},{"id":"100001715666710","name":"Razak Latif"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"551353703","name":"Jahanzeb Zuberi"},{"id":"649049339","name":"Basit Saeed"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100005736485212","name":"AK Pasha"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"286700230","name":"Umair Shafi Afzal"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100006124596459","name":"Falak Saleem"},{"id":"1361427391","name":"Rehman Baloch"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM2MTQyNzM5MQ\u003d\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_588678361183318/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTM2MTQyNzM5MQ%3D%3D"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"588679791183175","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Was a pretty good experience overall.

The four of us ordered Goat Cheese & Fig Pizza, Parmesan Chicken, Caesar Salad and Old School Beef Cheese Burger along with 3 Lemontas and their Chocolate Brownie with Ice cream for dessert. \nThe pizza failed to impress me. True, it was light and baked to perfection but it lacked flavor and it kinda reminded me of homemade grilled cheese sandwiches. The burger was AHHMAZING! The Caesar Salad wasn't exactly great either, I know quite a few other places serving better version of this salad. The Parmesan Chicken however was delicious! Lemontas were, as always extremely refreshing and the chocolate brownie remains one of my favorite desserts in the city..Can't get enough of it really, it's a must try. \nAlso, the place desperately needs a UPS because while we were there, the electricity went and came at least 4-5 times. I guess that can be forgiven though considering the current state of the entire city when it comes to electricity issues. \nDespite a few minor flaws, there's just something about Xander's..Its always a pleasant experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-19T19:42:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-20T11:34:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"100004312209331","name":"Safi Hasan Rizvi"},{"id":"557711846","name":"Gulnar Kabraji"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"1795675310","name":"Maha Javed Chishty"},{"id":"501478359","name":"Mohammad Mikail Soomro"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"1460213785","name":"Hareem Kh"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1291671692","name":"Shehrbano Ibrahim"},{"id":"509209694","name":"Sheheryar Khan"},{"id":"100002850760185","name":"Nayab Ali"},{"id":"100003201386322","name":"Hera Ryaz"},{"id":"511368155","name":"Anam Amin"},{"id":"100001039943363","name":"Munawar M Shahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMDM5OTQzMzYz","before":"NTU3MzIxMjM2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"573599279357893","from":{"name":"Anam Amin","id":"511368155"},"message":"I agree with \"there's just something about Xander's\" that one finds their flaws forgivable.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:00:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573603826024105","from":{"name":"Moomal Shahab Channa","id":"512199353"},"message":"Thumbs up for the parmesan chicken at xanders","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:15:30+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573609312690223","from":{"name":"Sohaib Khan","id":"686900066"},"message":"I loved their mini burgers not sure what they called.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:36:59+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573610032690151","from":{"name":"Tehmina 'Manna' Khan","id":"549225127"},"message":"Oh yea those are awesome!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:39:54+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573863509331470","from":{"name":"Sarah Qureshi","id":"1219353074"},"message":"We have had horrible experiences there.

Had been there probably 10 yrs back. Hadn't returned coz the dessert then wasn't anything special. Sadly last night it was the same. Had the chocolate cupcake, nutella crepe and plain cold coffee. The crepe was generous in size and really filled with nutella so my daughter loved it. The cupcake came with piping hot chocolate icing which slid off on to the plate as the cupcake reached our table. Looked like it had been microed right there. My daughter finished off the icing but the cupcake was tasteless and so dry that she left it and I had to have water to make it go down my throat. The cold coffee was like having thick cold fresh milk with a touch of coffee essence. Also left that. Bland and tasteless again. Judging by the clientele, mostly teeny boppers, it seems that food isn't really a priority. The idea seems to be to be a place for young kids to hang out. The decor is fun and casual and I can imagine young people going there for fun not for the food. Don't want to risk trying any of their other desserts as it seems like they have the fancy names but no taste.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-10T06:33:32+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-10T08:36:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"422651261119363","from":{"name":"Luciferz Angel","id":"792470170"},"message":"I love their apple crumble, and their roast chicken sandwich in sun dried tomato bread (just ask them to go easy on the mayo & butter)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-10T06:52:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"422652644452558","from":{"name":"Lailabano Ibrahim","id":"1399965023"},"message":"Their ice reams are really good \nI only go there for that \nOtherwise their food isn't that good","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-10T07:01:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"422653974452425","from":{"name":"Bushra Joyo","id":"1421223164"},"message":"The last time I went there I had one of their burger's and chocolate brownie with Ice cream.

In awe of your superb lunch deals that we tried today, and sad because we did not try them earlier!! \n\nThe three course lunch deals with mocktails at Rs 644 + tax are actually too good to be true. Although I wanted to sample some of the strongly SWOT-recommended entrees, one glance at the deals, and I decided we were all going for them. And am I glad that we did! \n\nNot only was the food scrumptious to the core, the portions were more than ample. (we were quite skeptical about the portion sizes.) I took the Seafood deal and Irfan opted for the Beef deal while our daughters shared the Pasta deal. \n\nSo here's what came to our table: \nStarters: \n  Hot & Sour Soup: tangy, fragrant and flavourful. Loved it!\n  Som Tam (papaya salad): fresh, crunchy and fiery. just as I like it!\n  Chilli Honey Glazed Wings: the quantity (five wings) was impressive, taste was a little ketchup-y but it fared well with the girls. \n\nEntrees:\n   Wok Fried Beef with basil chilli oyster sauce served with steamed rice: Verrry generous portion, scrumptious, a tad bit less flavourful than Fuchsia's. \n   Tamarind Chilli Fish with Basil served with rice: Thank God for the separately served tamarind sauce!! The lightly battered fish was very crisp and did not turn soggy as it usually does after being doused with the sauce. \n   Fettuccine Alfredo: Looked awesome. and the girls polished it off! \n\nDesserts:\n   Bread & butter pudding with ice cream: ohmygodthatwastoogood!! I am definitely going to be dreaming about it for days to come!\n   Chocolate Molten Lava Cake served with ice cream: The chocolate was not strong enough, although the cake was very moist. Ice cream was awfully crystallized. \n\nDrinks:\n   Pina Colada, Lemon Margarita, and Fresh Lime with 7-up: All good!\n\nNeedless to say, we were stuffed beyond imagination! The place is lovely and very pleasant. The seating is highly comfortable. The outdoor patio is such a romantic spot. :)\nThe servers were very courteous and prompt. However, somehow our server was not knowledgeable enough about the lunch deals. He missed our drinks totally and was kind of puzzled when we asked about them. So the drinks arrived after we were done with our main course. But this was the only hiccup in our otherwise absolutely fantastic dining experience.

The place has 180 seats at three different levels inc a lounge. We started off with Roasted Tomato and Broccoli Soup, for starters we had Spinach and Artichoke Dip, were also served complimentary bread basket, warm and fresh bread, the Soup was good topped with goat's cheese and well flavored. Main course comprised of Kalamata Chicken ? Marinated chicken with kalamata, green olives and sun-dried tomatoes and \nGrilled Fillet of Chicken with Rocket Grilled chicken topped with rocket leaves drizzled in delicate garlic olive served with Saut?ed mushrooms and vegetable timbale. The food was served hot and excellent presentation but the meat needed to be a tad bit more tender. For drinks we had Falsa Juice less sugar, a bit sour but authentic not artificial in flavor. Last but not the least desert was Warm Apple crumble with Ice cream, baked apple pie was a bit hard and required an effort to break but combined with Ice cream was delicious. Service was excellent, staff was polite, attentive and the manager was kind enough to ask us \"How was your meal\". One of the reasons for me to swot this place was to have an objective analysis as to how well team Aylanto is performing! after reading many negative reviews and not many reviews these days, Aylanto finally seems to be on track now, after weathering the storms, as the place was packed with people and they kept coming and coming till about 2:15 pm......which means they are delivering on quality of service.....only one thing seriously needs to be looked into, that is when the bill was presented it was simply on a piece paper with GST being charged at 16% and no proper bill was given with a valid GST no. The server was called and he gave the excuse that the machine was out of order, then the manager was summoned and he gave the excuse that the accountant is not present, and if we need the proper bill we will have to wait, as it will take HALF AND HOUR, then he under took the responsibility to have the bill delivered to our give address, we advised him to make it, scan it, and email it us, he committed he would do so, but unfortunately even after a passage of three hours when I write these lines no proper bill has been emailed. Cafe Aylanto which is one of the most prestigious and respected restaurants in Karachi, has done very well on all counts accept this one. This is a serious matter which they need to investigate and get back asap. If I am being charged GST, it is my right as a customer to insure that it is being accounted for in the proper manner, and not only charged, but accounted for and deposited in the respective gop account. This is not an allegation but an observation, early also they presented a bill which was on a piece of paper and not a properly printed one with GST no, complaint lodged and no action was taken which does not reflect well on this establishment. I am sure someone would like to clarify this issue.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-19T12:49:46+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-19T12:49:46+0000","restaurantName":"Ice cream"},{"id":"165861103465048_391417744242715","from":{"name":"Aruna Sujanani","id":"691887360"},"message":"I too was invited to the Magnum event, however I had no idea that it was a bloggers meet! (I did not get the teaser or the invite in time and was sent an e-invite.) Not being a blogger myself, this is my first experience on an event such as this and my personal stance on the event is as follows:\n\nIn my mind I always equate Magnum to the 7 deadly sins, opulence and decadence. Yesterday at the presentation, it felt that their branding had changed focus to a more regal and royal theme but still having the underlined feel of opulence and decadence.  They wanted to portray that if you eat a Magnum, you would feel like being a King or Queen. Their main ingredient that would help them achieve that was ?Belgian Chocolate?.  How they are going to educate the masses regarding the qualities of the Belgian chocolate was not discussed and as you can see from the youtube clip (it is the same one from their own presentation) there is no mention of Belgian chocolate!  Another point is when I tasted the Magnum, the chocolate did not feel any different from other Magnums that I have tasted previously.\n \nTheir target market was 18-35 years old and people who fell into a more affluential  background. Their claim was that the Magnum was going to be the most expensive ice cream in Pakistan per single serving and that they would also be opening a Magnum Caf?. The magnum Caf? would also have a ?Make your own? Magnum dipping station. Although a fun idea, a dipping station is in my opinion is something  which is more catered towards children rather than adults and as I witnessed it was quite a messy job too! The dippings that they had were sprinkles, nuts and fruits, chocolate etc. Personally I find it very hard to see how any person could stick pieces of fruit on to the Magnum and I for one think fruit is a bad idea.\n\nOn the whole, will the Magnum entice the Pakistan public.... probably Yes! But will it be a profitable venture and achieve their goals and profit margins, that...... time will tell :-)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-03T08:25:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-13T01:35:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"795545463","name":"Riffat Alam"},{"id":"1091434889","name":"Haris Khan"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"1473431885","name":"Syed Aamir Bukhari"},{"id":"100000093496883","name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzMzcxOTYzMA\u003d\u003d","before":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"391463167571506","from":{"name":"Sarah J.K","id":"708025491"},"message":"lol cute ad...  they shoulda re-enacted something like this","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-03T10:33:02+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391477424236747","from":{"name":"Aruna Sujanani","id":"691887360"},"message":"They kinda did.

Gracias, a friend and I decided to check it out. The place is no doubt cozy and I absolutely loved the old school music playing there (dunno if it?s a usual but nonetheless it was great listening to some classics). We ordered Tacos, Quesadillas, and the Mexican sandwich which were truly scrumptious and a generous serving I must say. The cucumber / mint lemonades were absolutely refreshing especially in the afternoon heat. And the Toffee Brownie with Vanilla Ice cream was the cherry on the cake. Had a great time there and enjoyed Mexican food after a very long time. A must-try for all!!!\n\nHowever, I did have a few suggestions. Firstly, Mexican food is absolutely incomplete without black beans (baked or fried) and Mexican rice. Usually the main entrees are served with a side order of black beans and Mexican rice and well as much as we love French fries, they kinda/ sorta don?t go together. Secondly, guacamole / avocado is extensively used in Mexican food, especially the dip which was sorta lacking with the quesadillas and mind I say the dip definitely adds flavor to the food. Thirdly, could you add more Mexican dishes to the menu like chicken flautas, fajitas, chalupas and the like in the menu..oh also have the tacos in soft or hard shell. Just giving my 2 cents worth. \n\nCheers!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-02T17:25:41+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-06T16:05:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"512272922","name":"Natasha Ahmed"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"678500467","name":"Saba Shakeel"},{"id":"1091434889","name":"Haris Khan"},{"id":"100001375323502","name":"Rukhsana Malim"},{"id":"828190023","name":"Shaheen Nouman"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"100000522564819","name":"Imran Bahadur"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"512185530","name":"Sidra Shah"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA3NjI4NTIxNQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NTEyMjcyOTIy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"391294840921672","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"And after missing the quac.

I wish the weather were slightly better so we could sit outdoors, because the kind of racket these two separate huge groups of people were making, simply ruined our experience of such a serene setting. \n\nComing to the food, since I just wanted a light snack, I ordered Wasabi Prawns, to be followed by Tiramisu, and my husband ordered a regular cappuccino and Chocolate Fudge Cake with Vanilla Ice cream. It was rather disappointing to see just four medium sized batter-fried prawns placed on each corner of a rectangular platter with romaine and iceberg lettuce in the middle. Not just that, there was barely a hint of wasabi sauce brushed on top of the prawns. Rs 595 + tax for such a dish is a bit too steep by all standards! All I could think of at that time was Xander's OVERLOADED prawn sandwich! (which by the way, was what we had set out to eat initially, but the place was jam-packed and so I had the brilliant (?) idea of checking out Aylanto.) \n\nThe desserts fortunately were a saving grace and a half. The fudge cake was moist and dense, however, the ice cream was crystallized and even though we sent it back, the replacement was no better. My tiramisu was divine.. subtle balance of flavours, light and creamy . The coffee flavour was not overpowering but still made its presence felt. That is something I could go back to Aylanto for.. But I'll give it some time first to learn from and act upon the customers' feedback. \n\nThe service was fine, the manager was apologetic about the noise and commotion. Outdoors would be lovely once the weather improves. I really want to go back to Aylanto, hope they up their game soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T09:30:41+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-06T09:30:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"711699788","name":"Sanaa Zubairi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzExNjk5Nzg4","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"restaurantName":"Ice cream"},{"id":"165861103465048_311139252270565","from":{"name":"Luciferz Angel","id":"792470170"},"message":"After BOT's sitting at Ole' for Coffee & Desert with Abi, Naeem sb and Fouzia...
