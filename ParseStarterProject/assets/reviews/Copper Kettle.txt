Ordered Southern Fried Chicken for Takeaway from the recently opened outlet adjacent to National Stadium, and the order was ready within 15 minutes.  The place still doesn't accept credit cards, so that's a bummer.\n\nThe economics behind pricing of chicken is weird, with 2 pieces for PKR300, and 3 pieces for PKR410 -- with per unit cost of chicken increasing substantially if one wants to order 4 pieces of chicken.  The economically efficient quantity to order is in multiples of 3.\n\nThe fried chicken was just perfect -- probably the best I've had in a while from anywhere in the world.  The fried chicken served was cooked well, barely had any greasy elements, and just had the perfect crisp.  It is insanely difficult to find well-cooked non-greasy fried chicken, and Burger Inc. certainly makes the cut.\n\nThe fried chicken is better than the fried-in-diesel chicken at KFC, the synthetic chicken at OPTP, and even Popeye's (at par, if not better).\n\nWill definitely be trying it again, as soon as they start accepting plastic!\n\nOverall Rating -- 8.5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-05T11:56:53+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-06T12:03:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"554105251","name":"Rida Shoaib"},{"id":"807200363","name":"Laila Jatoi"},{"id":"517543633","name":"Ahmed Siddiqui"},{"id":"579933313","name":"Ali Daudpota"},{"id":"667017252","name":"Taha Javed"},{"id":"1424317236","name":"Anwer Jamal Chandna"},{"id":"559881298","name":"Nadia Mahasin"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"518748331","name":"Zia Saeed"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"100002505633547","name":"Umme Kulsoom Khalid Ahmed"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"100001388892633","name":"Zahra Mirza"},{"id":"731221630","name":"Usama Aziz"},{"id":"1062305825","name":"Warood Chaudhary"},{"id":"780560073","name":"Anita Zeeshan Al-Najjar"},{"id":"549655574","name":"Nazish Huda"},{"id":"654231486","name":"Sami Khan"},{"id":"514973279","name":"Ahmad Jawed"},{"id":"645995992","name":"Rida Sadiq"},{"id":"688336352","name":"Abbas Farid"},{"id":"588501861","name":"Tanveer Farooq"},{"id":"100000673113966","name":"Nashra Jamil"},{"id":"100001352416590","name":"Zulekha Rizwan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMzUyNDE2NTkw","before":"NTU0MTA1MjUx"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_645382885512865/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTAwMDAxMzUyNDE2NTkw"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"645386475512506","from":{"name":"Anum Rasheed","id":"100001881992250"},"message":"I like your practical use of economics there.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-05T12:05:55+0000","like_count":9,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645387302179090","from":{"name":"Tehreem Fatima","id":"892195391"},"message":"synthetic chicken hahah!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-05T12:08:57+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645387788845708","from":{"name":"Hammad Ahmed","id":"712230730"},"message":"I had their trademark tribeca beef burger a week back,and found it to be one of the best tasting burgers around.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-05T12:10:33+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645389272178893","from":{"name":"Saad Siddiqui","id":"507770148"},"message":"They probably planned the entire setup to get back at an annoying microeconomics question they once encountered, and someone in the back is studying consumer behaviour and indifference curves.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-05T12:16:20+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645391362178684","from":{"name":"Sahrish Naseer","id":"1807053822"},"message":"Pieces","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-05T12:25:06+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645391962178624","from":{"name":"Romano Karim Yusuf","id":"832750315"},"message":"Southern 'Friend' Chicken'?

Complementary bread with garlic, and cucumber n some other veg with cheese mayo dip served. Both were good n I would rate them 8/10. We ordered cesar salad, the chicken quantity was very less for the hefty price. 6/10 Crepe champs elysees was good but overall not very filling quantity, 9/10. \n\nNow comes the steak. Ordered djonnaise steak, I was told it will be local tenderloin but I guess it was fillet mignon since the width was about 1.5 inch but the size was really small making it a total of 200 something grams. I ordered medium well but it looked pretty much medium, I requested them for it to be cooked more since and they changed it without any hesitation. 9/10. BUT it still does not beat the steak I ate in dxb, not even close and not that big as well.\n\nDidn't order the choc lava cake which was another reason to go there cuz I saw the dish being served on another table and it looked too tiny with vanilla icecream. \nOverall a good experience but too expensive for the quantity (2800 for 3 dishes of which 2 are starters). 10% service charge was applied but since it wasn't written anywhere I asked the manager to deduct it which he did, saving me 200+ rupees. I think it's a matter of principle and they should write it before charging.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-06T17:55:04+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"581431248574696","from":{"name":"Hamna Furqan","id":"667165223"},"message":"told u about the quantity :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-06T18:45:38+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"581647621886392","from":{"name":"Nasim Ahmad","id":"1343979604"},"message":"Thanks for the detailed review, Basit.

The fries both French and Curly were served absolutely cold and are a waste coz the same cant be consumed.  The burgers were nothing great to write home about, we ordered the mushroom & Swiss thick burger, grilled chicken, jalape?o and buffalo along with side orders of chilli lava fries and chicken tenders.  There was an excessive use of sauces and mayo in the burgers that the patty kept slipping out of the buns.  The buns were, however, very fresh and soft.   The only item worth mentioning are the chicken tenders which were served fresh with a sauce which had an amazing flavour.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T19:10:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-07T13:17:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"555701439","name":"Raamish Zaidi Irani"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"669795452","name":"Haseeb Akhtar"},{"id":"726690443","name":"Danial Rizvi"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"561399662","name":"M Azwerul Haque"},{"id":"620275602","name":"Maria Jaffar"},{"id":"510835801","name":"Nudrrat Khawaja"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"},{"id":"100003784320529","name":"Shahzad Saeed"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"100000391823197","name":"Farah S.
