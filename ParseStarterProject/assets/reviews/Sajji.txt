And that's the only thing that was lacking in that area. \n\nThe place it self is lovely, still not yet open so parts were being worked on. RED was the predominant color, in fact I don't think there was any other colour. But the sea was lovely the wood work solid and the full moon made the ambiance gorgeous. Yes it's very red, with lights, carpet chairs all red. But what is a Chinese without the red.\n\nThe food was limited since it was just an soft launch. But was good and each item tasted different. As the weather gets cooler the soups will become more popular. One tip thu the prawn crackers didn't survive the humidity - thu were fresh when came to the table....wilted almost instantly. Soups arrived hot and each one was different from the other. The chicken corn was actually great, the seafood coriander very nice and the hot & sour. Starters had steamed wontons and prawn tempura which I was happy to see, steamed wontons/dumplings (dimsum) is a fav and thank god becoming popular here too. The rice and noodles were both well seasoned and cooked well. In fact many commented how nice the rice was on its own. Chicken Schezuan was amazing as was the beef chili dry, and honey chicken with sesame (a little too sweet for my taste) the sticky sweet fish I don't like anywhere and this was no exception thu really liked the lemon fish. \n\nAll in all a good evening spent with great friends checking out a new place. We wish them all the best and hope that the few issues they were facing will be sorted out before the hungry crowds of discerning Karachiites arrive.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-19T06:01:40+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-20T18:17:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"724148371","name":"Rabia Hai"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"514292991","name":"Marium Hosein"},{"id":"547501074","name":"Rehana Naseer"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"522977702","name":"Sheikh Hasan Rasul"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"504517271","name":"Usman Tanzeel"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"622525326","name":"Mohsin E Azam"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"511301771","name":"Eefa Khalid"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI0NDc2NzM1","before":"NTg0NjgyMjQz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_620982761286211/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTI0NDc2NzM1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"620983104619510","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"The place does have a name but its not yet put up outside.

Just a delicious pizza, probably the best around if one is looking for that greasy pizza full of flavor.  Lets call it the Johari Deep Pan.\n\nMost would not be aware of Miss Hen, unless they have spent some time at the IBA Main Campus, or live in NA-253.  The pizza just has insane amount of topping, and is full of flavor.

Had some squash juices and milk roohafza on the table prior Iftar, the iftar menu was fine, later when it came to the mains that is when i started regretting LQ. The food variety was not big and it lacked quality and taste, opted for tempura prawns and there it lied a small prawn in the big oily crispy coating. Then went for some BBQ. It was so so, then found something with a name tag of Shahzada Salim Khas.. on my curiosity i took a bit and there it was Pasta Alfredo. Seriously did the mughals had Pastas at that time LOL. That is some serious Epic Joke. Out of all those dishes around this was re-named. Went on to Fish Tikka, too much salt in it with no such flavors. The chinese almost ended. Then tried Sajji, it did some justice compared to other food. It was later I shifted to Deserts and had some bit of various sweets. The Shahi Tukra had nothing Shahi in them !! The labe shereen was fine others were upto LQ expectations !! The food was seriously low quality and taste, with attentive service. Rs 1250/- per head exclusive drinks. Seriously it does not in any way does justice. Went to Kolachi a week ago and i Must say it was worth every penny. I would give LQ 2/10.

And I don't doubt that for a bit. I have been dining in some of Do Darya's best-kept secrets for many months now, and I must say it's quite an experience. This so-called food revolution happening in the area has seen many of the country?s best new restaurants sprouting like mushrooms in this scenic area. And for those of you searching for a culinary experience like no other, look no further than Sajjad restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant is renovated recently with the special addition of huts on the sea, unlike other restaurants who have the seating arrangements / tables quite off the sea area. However, the interior will remind visitors of a minimalist. The decor allows the simplistic beauty of the food to really shine, though beauty isn't the only thing bringing folks to Sajjad. The restaurant buzzed with excited energy and was comfortably full with seemingly satisfied patrons.\n\nWhen we reached there, we witnessed an unusual rush and a lot of cars parked already including rushing media vehicles and few dozens of private security vans. When inquired, it was revealed that some ministers and a lot of media, like a bee looking for a beautiful flower, were there. The restaurant's capacity is maximum 800 people and i was Gobsmacked when the person on the welcome desk told us that there are already more than 950 people there, a lot others willing to stand and few desperate to sit on the grass and pay the full amount. Early reservations always save us from embarrassment especially when one is accompanied with friends or guests. Similarly; the timely reservations made earlier on the day, we were induced to our table with a reservation platen / tablet. The placement of  our table was actually the starting of the stupendous experience we have had later last night. It felt that we were in the middle of the sea. The best part was not only the comfortable sofa and lighting but also the privacy. When we go to the other eateries located at Do Darya, the placement of tables or seating arrangement is too congested /crowded. One can easily hear what the other person is talking on the other table. Fortunately, that was not the case there. Also the lamp which lit the table was soft and did not hurt the eyes. There was a bottle of Hand Sanitizer on all the tables.  \n(Picture is attached) \n\nFOOD\nFor Iftar, nicely packed dates in a plate were served with Roohafza Sharbat in milk/water. The Rooh afza Sharbat actually brought back a lot of child hood memories and it quenched our thirst while breaking the fast. Since there was rush; as mentioned earliar and the typical buffet mentality, to fill the plates unnecessarily and the competition, look I have the most on my plate! the items for Iftar finished quickly. Lo and behold, it appeared the staff was well trained to deal with such panic stricken crowd and situations, in few seconds, another serving was brought. Believe you me, fresh and more quantity than before. I detest to mention this here but I witnessed with my own eyes that people who were there in their Chauffeur driven cars, filled another plate and called their drivers to have it. The staff still did not say anything and it seemed their smiling faces spoke a lot. Literate, Ill-literate and A-literate :)\n\nMy friends and I went for namaz and decided to take the Iftar items, if left by the mob, after namaz. To our utter surprise, the restaurant staff kept on refilling the items, fresh and sizzling hot, after namaz too unlike other restaurants where they do not refill after namaz and focus only on dinner items once the fast is over. By the way, they had Wazu place and proper arrangements for both ladies and gents for Namaz/prayers.\n\nThere were almost nineteen (not really sure and please blame my taste buds) Pakistani dishes for dinner. Starting from Sajji to Lamb ( Kuzu Tandir Aakha dumba or Grilled meat of lamb) Prawn Tempura, Fish, Live BBQ items , Live all sort of Tandoor/Naan,  Nehari, few different types of Biryanis and a touch of continental food in form of 3 to 4 chicken and beef items, Cheese Pasta, variety of Chinese and honestly there was so much, I have forgotten the names already. The taste was divine! No exaggeration but I have never tasted such delicious food in my life ever. Not to forget, all that happening where that competition going on in the crowd, who has the most food on one?s plate! :D I would rate 10 out 10 to the food.\n\nThere were different variety of salads and all the dishes had a name tag. There were a few desserts, but they finished quickly so waiting was the only option. While we were waiting, we saw Kakark Dooh Patti Chai (tea) being cooked live. What else could caffeine lovers dream of? Not to forget, very few places where Tea is part of the Buffet. We all had our tea and mean while dessert bar was set up again. My rating for dessert is 7.5 out of 10.\nThere?s no doubt at Sajjad Restaurant will quickly become the hottest reservation in town! \n\nAlbeit there were Janitors cleaning the over all restaurant then and there, one thing Sajjad Restaurant people should work on is cleanliness in the rest room. I am just not writing this here likeother  people who have bad experiences of other places and without talking to the concerned people of the restaurant, they mention it here. Actually I spoke to the restaurant staff near the wash room area and told them about it, where they told me about the huge crowd using the loo,  and the reason was valid. It was not surprising for me when they told me that they place napkins/ tissue papers time to time but there are few customers who do not hesitate to take the tissue roll /napkins, hand sanitizers and place it in their pockets or bags! After all they pay a good amount; so, without any judgement, according to them, they are entitled for the toiletries as well! :-)","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-07-20T01:25:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-20T09:21:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"535211286","name":"Abdul Aziz Anis"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"611818619","name":"Humaira Shakil"},{"id":"100001715666710","name":"Razak Latif"},{"id":"1049298397","name":"Sadiya Naveed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"100001098310753","name":"Ashfaq Parekh"},{"id":"1170084800","name":"Ammaar Ahmed"},{"id":"761278691","name":"Abdullah Soomro"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"657151302","name":"Nishat Mustafa"},{"id":"509686069","name":"Hasaan Mubasher Sheikh"},{"id":"619270706","name":"???

The cheese filled naans (obviously an innovation) were delish and so was the mutton kardhai, whole fried fish and the white chicken kardhai (infact i think it would gone great with some tagliatelli). The only disappointment was the Chicken Sajji and the traditional chicken kardhai which arrived undercooked. there was little in the way of dessert.    \n\nWhilst inspecting their (what looked like) an overstaffed kitchen, I noticed the naan/roti \"packer\" guy was sitting with his feet and shoes positioned right next to the roti basket. I had to tell him off and warned the manager at the time. The guy applying the ghee on the naans was so slow.

Prepared and served hygienically in disposable containers/plates.  Though I am not a Zinger type burger fan, however, people rave about Cool Inn's Zinger clone.  The masala dossa is also pretty decent and the Spicy Chicken Boti Bun has a unique flavour (be cautioned its really really spicy).  They also make a  great faluda and the cold-stone ice cream (which they call as Katakat Ice Cream) is very good for the price.  Love their dark chocolate flavour and have it  \"Katakated\" with Soft Mints with a topping of chocolate sauce.  They serve the Katakat Ice Cream in a waffle cup which is crispy and delicious.  A whole variety of ice cream flavours is available to suit all tastes. Cool Inn is a must visit place for all Chaat lovers.  Its great value for money.  The owner Noor Bhai is always present there and ensures quality and hygeine.  All their chutneys are made with mineral water and cooking/frying is done in Soya Supreme/Rafhan Corn Oil.  Orders for Rs. 400/- and above are delivered free of cost to adjacent areas.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-26T05:50:26+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"284400194944471","from":{"name":"Mohammed Sadiq Maniar","id":"835955450"},"message":"the paneer chicken is the best at Mehran Sajji, all of you must try it at clifton","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-26T06:28:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mjg0NDAwMTk0OTQ0NDcx","before":"MjgzOTAwMDg0OTk0NDgy"}}},"restaurantName":"Sajji"},{"id":"165861103465048_274332515951239","from":{"name":"Danial Rizvi","id":"726690443"},"message":"So after yesterday's post by Hassan Khan.
