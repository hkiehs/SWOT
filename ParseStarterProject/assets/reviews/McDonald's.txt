So it was my best friend Bisma's birthday celebration today so my friends and I went on a 'eating spree' you could say today and thus, I will write the reviews for all the places we went to and the things we ate.\nThe first place was McDonald's :p amazing caramel shake! One large shake between 4 girls. Hehe. And fries are always good. Then we went to Dolmen ka Gloria Jeans. We ordered the Aussie cheese fries and a mixed berry chiller. Both were, in my friend's words, outstanding. The cheese fries at Gloria's are the best! \nNext, Golden Dragon. We ordered the lunch box deal for one with egg fried rice and Szechuan chicken, though I personally insisted on the dinner deal which has 2 drumsticks as well (for lunch, I might add) and even though they said it was not possible, Qamarunisa is such a sweetheart that we spoke to her and she made it happen. Love her for that because we got drumsticks (that i was desperate for cuz they are so yummy). So overall drumsticks, Szechuan, rice, everything was divine as usual. Lastly, Grub. From what I can tell, this place is highly underrated and has amazing food so I think it deserves a good review. We ordered Grub Mush burgers, one pepperoni pizza, and their chocolate cake. The burger was huge and yummy as usual. It was the first time for all of us in ordering the pizza. It was quite yummy, cheesy and filling. The cake was soft, moist and just the right amount of chocolately goodness.

There wasn't any difference compared to the ones I've had in Dubai. Tastes the same. The service was good. And it's a bit unfair comparing it places that serve gourmet burgers. It's not competing with them, it's competing with McDonald's. I had the double Whopper myself and with fries. For the money and taste, I think the Big Mac is better. As are the fries.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-10-27T16:30:51+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-28T05:03:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"100005945647613","name":"Sara H Khan"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"512542175","name":"Nabiya Fahad Khan"},{"id":"561071696","name":"Kamran Hashim"},{"id":"600940187","name":"Shakaib Nawab"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"629799782","name":"Nusrat Alamgir Shah"},{"id":"514407087","name":"Saad Aslam"},{"id":"690914766","name":"Ayesha Mallick"},{"id":"1277228905","name":"Rehan Ahmad Khan"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"100001816848014","name":"Subhana Rahman"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Tried this a few days ago, finally getting the time to write this now.\nDomino?s used to be a regular at our home, but had stopped ordering due to lapses in quality. Decided to order again after reading good reviews on food forums combined with prompting by the parents (who have always loved Dominos)and I am happy to say that the old Domino?s taste is back notable improvements. \nOrdered the Tandoori Feast (Chicken), Italiano Feast (Beef) & the Stuffed Tex-Mex Cheesy Bread  and the food came in 30 minutes on the dot. The best part about the Pizza ? the beautiful crust, crisp yet soft & chewy, with a dusting of cornmeal at the edges! I became a fan of McD?s when they launched their cornmeal burger buns and exact same experience with Dominos! Toppings wise, there could have been more chicken and a little bit more consistency across slices might have prevented fights over the best pieces. However, both flavors were loved by the family. \nThen the Cheesy Bread ? Domino?s is known for its Pizza, but the bread could easily have been the star of the evening! Breadsticks stuffed with cheese & tex-mex chicken topped with cheese made for 8 pieces of delicious cheesy indulgence!\nMy only complaints: the lack of condiments ?there was no garlic & red chili flakes. Secondly, one small container of marinara sauce is not enough for the breadsticks, so more would be preferred. \nLastly, they need to update their menu on their website! The current deals link does not work, and they don?t have any delivery deals for ?x? number of people mentioned. Since the order taker told me about a deal for 4 people, I am sure there are some and updating them would save time in order placement. \nP.s. deleting & posting again because had mistakenly posted a really small picture earlier!","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-10-19T21:31:03+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-20T12:16:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"512777667","name":"AMmar Mursalin"},{"id":"100002971695699","name":"Syeda Tehseen Zehra Naqvi"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"579933313","name":"Ali Daudpota"},{"id":"675647072","name":"Ambreen Ashraf"},{"id":"1035196445","name":"Anusha Ahmed"},{"id":"521905536","name":"Umair Durrani"},{"id":"100003698171140","name":"Asra Mushtaq"},{"id":"500846017","name":"Sheharyar Mujahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAwODQ2MDE3","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc0MDgxMjMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"636902953027525","from":{"name":"Shahroz McRashid","id":"100003629416976"},"message":"where are the all the (Y) s?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-19T22:21:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"636945583023262","from":{"name":"Hasnain Hanif","id":"770944605"},"message":"this made me emotional :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T01:12:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637048449679642","from":{"name":"Khalid Saleem","id":"657031744"},"message":"your review is quite appealing and would definitely give it a try soon but i wonder why the pictures are so bland saying more of otherwise what you expressed","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T07:05:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637058733011947","from":{"name":"Kiran Afzal","id":"635810442"},"message":"Could be either of two issues: not great photography and pizza doesn't always photograph well, especially when its beef! ..better pictures next time, hopefully!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T07:40:10+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637089983008822","from":{"name":"Nasim Ahmad","id":"1343979604"},"message":"Very nice.

If BK owned by the same people who owned Pizza Hut then its bad news unless they totally revamp their quality control and dedication to providing a top quality product for a customer who had the kindness, courtesy and trust to part with his/her money for a reasonable dining experience. That's what going into the food business is all about: It's about returning that kindness and trust someone has for you and responding with the best quality possible for that money. I can't judge BK until I try it myself (maybe in a week or so when the crowds lessen a bit). Let's see how it goes. P.s. Have been a McDonald's fan ever since a kid and although we know the barrage of criticism and jokes McDonald's gets in the commercial aspect I respect them because they always maintain the quality and product, and that's especially important here in Pakistan. Only once or twice I had a bad experience with McDonald's here (stale bun) in many years. A friend of mine from L.A. who owns 3-4 Taco Bells, KFC's and a Pizza Hut there had McDonald's here and said it was far superior to any McDonald's in the US (the halal beef probably helps).","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-08T06:10:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"630288763688944","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"Why do people in our country in particular compare and expect the taste to be the same worldwide?

Got there to find 3 people waiting in line with the counter closed and a sign on the monitor that the staff is on a '10 minute break' on account of isha namaz. Fair enough. The wait stretched to 15 minutes and the line stretched by a further 10 persons behind me, on to the road. At this point a couple of people left the line and I asked the guard how much longer, to which he replied \"Abhi to jamaat khari hee nahee huee, time lagayga\" pointing to the adjacent masjid. Not wanting to wait any longer, I left. Suggestion: Whereas I (or the customers) may understand that you want to close shop and attend prayers, and if this will take 30 mins end to end, just say so! No point in saying 10 mins and keep customers hanging. \n\nTook the car around the block to find Big Thick Burgers and placed my order there.

Got complimentary Egg Muffin, Sausage Muffin and Hot Cakes and while I thought I would never be going again at 6 am to get breakfast in Karachi I might as well should also try the Big Breakfast which was a chicken sausage, muffin, scrambled eggs, hash brown and a coffee.
