Aman Virji gave us some excellent suggestions and was a great conversationalist. My friends all enjoyed the food and the environment. As for my experience, what can I say... I started off with the Seafood Trio and it was beautiful to look at and tasted just as good. The beef steak with chocolate balsamic reduction (I think it was called) was ridiculously good. I know some people see chocolate on steak and want to run away, but believe me if you haven't had it, go try it. The meat was cooked to perfection, perfect pink inside, soft and tender. Then the sauce, you won't understand until you taste it yourself. Even my friends were skeptical and when they tasted it they were shocked. It was like an explosion of flavor in my mouth and it continued with every chew. Layers upon layers of flavor it won't stop until you swallow. Then repeat the explosion with your next bite. I have to say by far that was the best steak I've had in Karachi. That dish itself made my day. I'm not sure what everyone else ordered but I know that they all liked what they had. For dessert we had molten lava cake and bread and butter pudding which weren't that amazing, but after the steak I didn't care lol.

Hifza Shah was sweet enough to offer us dinner anyway, but thats not something I do, so Hifza I will be visiting your restaurant soon, when i have a pocket full of money :)\n\nMoving on to where i ended up... Cafe Forty4.\n\nvery average experience. the food came really late. We ordered beef Carpaccio for starters, which was quite good. \nFor the main course we ordered beef tenderloin with chardonnay which was really really nice. Juicy succulent beef steak, between medium and well done. The sauce was delicious and mashed potatoes were yummy. The other entr?e that I ordered was chicken roulade, which was very average. Stuffed chicken with a green sauce. I might not be very acquainted with this particular dish, but to me it tasted like haray masalay ki chicken that my mom makes at home :P\n\nThe worst part of the evening was when we ordered desserts. It was past 12 when we were done with our main course. The server came over and handed us the dessert menu. We took our sweet time deciding what to have, and when 10 minutes later we told him our order, he said that the kitchen is closed and they wont be able to serve dessert.\nWhat kind of place closes their kitchen without first asking the seated customers if they want anything else? And if they close their kitchen at 12 on a Saturday night, why did their server give us the desser menu at 12:15? \n\nAlso, they need to tell their servers to not hover so much around the table. We were seated in the non-smoking section and we were the only people there. And our server kept coming to the table after every 7-8min, asking us if everything was fine. It got extremely annoying after the third or fourth time. i didnt know how to tell him to stop :s\n\nOverall, a pretty disappointing experience at Caf? Forty4. Maybe I went with very high expectations. But the food was very average and the service was a bit annoying.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-04T07:14:56+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-04T10:09:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"777568273","name":"Adeel Badar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nzc3NTY4Mjcz","before":"Nzc3NTY4Mjcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"392118704172619","from":{"name":"Adeel Badar","id":"777568273"},"message":"this cafe forty4 is one of my faculty at cbm.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-04T10:09:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MzkyMTE4NzA0MTcyNjE5","before":"MzkyMTE4NzA0MTcyNjE5"}}},"restaurantName":"Cafe Forty4"},{"id":"165861103465048_391033770947779","from":{"name":"Bilal Alvi","id":"641495625"},"message":"i'm heading out for dinner. i'm confused between Cafe Forty4 & Cafe Gracias.... or maybe try out the new Patio? or the pizza at Xanders....\n\na little help please?? :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-02T17:30:41+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-02T18:42:28+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"391045540946602","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"Stay home n order in from all those places ...Lols","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-02T17:51:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391046500946506","from":{"name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary","id":"100000093496883"},"message":"Cafe forty four","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-02T17:53:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391065550944601","from":{"name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim","id":"770358065"},"message":"cafe forty 4 or xanders!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-02T18:22:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391074384277051","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"44!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-02T18:36:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391077090943447","from":{"name":"Mariam Bilgrami","id":"603490700"},"message":"Forty4!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-02T18:42:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MzkxMDc3MDkwOTQzNDQ3","before":"MzkxMDQ1NTQwOTQ2NjAy"}}},"restaurantName":"Cafe Forty4"},{"id":"165861103465048_384616371589519","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Nezihe Hussain.... may I release my top ten places to eat or order in from In karachi, I  have to re try Cafe Forty4 and then my circuit and list is complete.

Sadly,both appetisers and the main courses (the seafood angel hair pasta,crispy beef and steaks) were average at best. The only saving grace was the dessert (Creme br?l?e and the bread pudding).
