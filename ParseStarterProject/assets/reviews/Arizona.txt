It need not be a fine dining place..\n\nOver the last 2+ years all I have seen in Karachi are different trends.. One person dares challenge Pizza Hut with a new very different offering and it becomes a hit among us 'the foodies'.. Next few weeks we see the numerous pizza places open up.. some are good some are OK but after a few weeks they all taste the same.. Then came the thin crust era (No offence to anyone I totally love Domino's Thin Crust pizza)  and everyone from Domino's and bakeries and cafe selling the thin crust..\n\nWhile everyone was enjoying the 20 inches pizza, Hardees came to town.. There again began this trend of selling burgers.. And its still ongoing..Everyday there is a new place advertising themselves..\n\nIs there any place in Karachi that offers something other than burgers and pizza and pasta which tastes good too... I don't mind having sea food or steaks (No Arizona or Roasters pls) but something that would just end this monotony in the food choices we have (or rather I have) in this city..\n\nI know some of you would say there is BOTS ( Love the food there), Ghaffar, Log Inn Lounge(Chapli Kebabs are awesome) and so on.. But really need some innovation something new and that can actually get someone hooked on to the place.. \n\nA few years ago there was this little cafe at Karsaz called Alao.. It used to have a great sandwich and very very good cold coffee.. It was a very quiet place yet I have not been able to find the same taste since it closed down..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-13T19:55:12+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-14T07:32:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002623239897","name":"Ezzy Irfan Izhar"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE2NTgyNjY2","before":"MTAwMDAyNjIzMjM5ODk3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"649509475100206","from":{"name":"Vishal Preetam","id":"1781512632"},"message":"burns road (Y)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-13T20:35:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"649513738433113","from":{"name":"Ammar Habib Khan","id":"685505866"},"message":"Rowtisserie.

It?s a sophisticated fine dining restaurant. The set-up is ?bistro style? and offers nice extensive menu. Ordered Mushroom Chicken, Chicken Cheese Burger, Fettuccine Pasta. Served within 15-20 minutes. The food was amazing and done with perfection. For Ambiance, some may find it cramped, I found it cozy albeit a little dark. Decor is fresh, sparkling clean white table cloths, indoor, outdoor both. The weather was pleasant so we chose to sat outside. Loved the green plantation with the dim lights in it. Nice addition to Karachi dining. \n\nMonte Cristo is doing great and gets 9/10 :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-04T11:58:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-04T13:54:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"500883930","name":"Saira Inam"},{"id":"708140643","name":"Fauzia Hanif H"},{"id":"666266173","name":"Nadya Omer"},{"id":"1183115625","name":"Adil Ahmad"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"502229090","name":"Fatima Hossain"},{"id":"780560073","name":"Anita Zeeshan Al-Najjar"},{"id":"717903318","name":"Navira Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE3OTAzMzE4","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"644871348897352","from":{"name":"Navira Khan","id":"717903318"},"message":"hi zartashia, can u plz tell me the total amount u paid there? i m planning to go there...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T12:11:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644872052230615","from":{"name":"Najia Farhan","id":"1576656836"},"message":"R kids allowed there?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T12:14:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644873762230444","from":{"name":"Fatima Hossain","id":"502229090"},"message":"Loved the ambiance but the burger is definitely better at roasters:) since it's owned by the same person!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T12:19:28+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644889105562243","from":{"name":"Zartashia Malik","id":"758741881"},"message":"We were five ppl and everyone has ordered an individual food. without drinks it has costed us Rs.4,800.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T12:53:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644892048895282","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"Burgers at fine dining restaurants?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T13:04:12+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644896672228153","from":{"name":"Abbas Jafri","id":"510967457"},"message":"Zartashia Malik I don't count as I was sick I only had tea hence 4 people :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T13:19:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"758741881","name":"Zartashia Malik","type":"user","offset":0,"length":15}]},{"id":"644899158894571","from":{"name":"Fatima Hossain","id":"502229090"},"message":"It's a steakhouse hence char grilled burgers","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T13:27:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644908955560258","from":{"name":"Ali Raza Pir","id":"515674780"},"message":"It sucks","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T13:52:02+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644909555560198","from":{"name":"Miriam Arsalan","id":"610671062"},"message":"I saw baby high chairs so kids r allowed","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T13:54:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644909598893527","from":{"name":"Ali Raza Pir","id":"515674780"},"message":"I have zero confidence in Arizona/Roasters/Monte Cristo management.

I checked out the menu on Karachi Snob (as well as seeing this post) and the menu looked amazing. But then I was scared about the servings being small so opted for Roaster's on Zamzama for steak. First time I ever visited Roaster's. I heard so much about it but both my wife and me were a bit disappointed on the steak. Dry and no zest at all (she had the BBQ steak, I had the Tarragon), and way overpriced for that kind of quality. Arizona Grill steaks much better quality and better price. In the end Allah ka Shukar for the lovely night out and having a nice meal but won't ever think Roaster's again for steak (I heard their burgers better).  But I was sad that we opted out of Forty-4 last minute (its a 5-min walk from our home too and we believe in giving first patronage to people in the neighborhood :) The food looks very nice and immaculately crafted. I promise to make this up and give Forty-4 a try soon. We went to Cafe Aylanto few months ago and I think theirs was the best steak I ever had for the money.

The place is just off Naheed's on Shaheed-e-Millat Road, and was formerly Arizona Grill.  Met up with an old friend there, and ordered the Flamied Grill Steak.\n\nI am generally wary of ordering steaks at a place which has Arizona in its name, or which in its menu serves more than 70% of steak entrees with random sauces.  Ordered a Flamed Grill Steak, since the description didn't enlist any sauce for it, and asked for it to be Medium Rare.\n\nWhat I was served was basically 'Beef Pasanday', and there is absolutely no way the entree can be classified as a steak.  There was no need for it to be Medium Rare, because beef pasanday are just served as beef pasanday, and not Medium Rare!\n\nWhat Grill House needs to do is add a side of potatoes, and serve some hot naan with pasanday -- and accordingly change the name of 'Flamed Grill Steak' to 'Masalaydaar Pasanday'.  I am sure that Maslaydaar Pasanday can be their best selling entree, if they can serve karak naan with it, and some raaita too, of course.\n\nThe place is blasphemy to the religion of steaks, and the beef entrees are only recommended if one is looking for a filling meal of pasanday.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-11T16:47:18+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-11T20:45:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"533260601","name":"Ali Shahid"},{"id":"506634707","name":"Iqra Anwar Shah"},{"id":"654231486","name":"Sami Khan"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"1664160731","name":"Amna Abbasi"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"553350590","name":"Faizan Chaghtai"},{"id":"502158910","name":"Mujtaba Karim"},{"id":"561575202","name":"Usuf Haroon"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100000087775469","name":"Arshad Shamsi"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"569950203","name":"Anis Rajwani"},{"id":"511149199","name":"Shaherbano H.

We were 5 friends and since the place is \"known\" for its steaks we all ordered it. I ordered Arizona Fire Steak which by name seemed Arizonas specialty, when my order arrived, which was in due time and served in correct temperature, it was the opposite of what I expected. By \"fire\" I thought it would be something hot, saucy, spicy but when platter was placed in front of me I wasn't sure I was at Arizona. The presentation was zero, it looked like a piece of dry meat placed in a platter with mashed potatoes to go with it, which looked liked uncooked pizza dough, and few boiled vegetables on the other side. Too unprofessional. Anyways I started to eat still hopeful that it might not taste the way it looks, but that was disappointment too. The taste wasn't that bad but nothing extraordinary. The mashed potatoes were too salty, out of all the things on it i liked the boiled vegetables :P. Then we ordered dessert which was Chocolate Silk Pie. It arrived with same, unappetizing presentation. The taste was good but there was nothing silky! Infact the bottom layer was so hard that I might have to stand up on it to break it. \nSo my experience at Arizona was really bad. after paying such a big amount I still left with half stomach empty. The staff was good and co-operative. Good service. But who goes to restaurant for the good service only?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-13T18:21:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-14T01:48:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001882596023","name":"Mansoor Zaheer"},{"id":"673197577","name":"Syed Talha Khurshid"},{"id":"559881298","name":"Nadia Mahasin"},{"id":"100001420487264","name":"Saqib M Ibrahim"},{"id":"651245042","name":"Falak Zahid Sheikha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjUxMjQ1MDQy","before":"MTAwMDAxODgyNTk2MDIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"602689159782238","from":{"name":"Faryal Naqvi","id":"739670623"},"message":"sadly arizona has really detoriated over time","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T18:25:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602691326448688","from":{"name":"Xaraa Aar Kay","id":"100001611544621"},"message":"the last time i went to Arizona.. it was Awesome!\ni went to Arizona at Atrium Mall...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T18:31:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602691796448641","from":{"name":"Sarah J.

It's adjacent to HLS a little farther away downhill. The interior is almost like Arizona + roasters. We went on chaand raat and were the only people sitting there, we were 8 people. Ordered dynamite prawns( which were exactly like the ones at gun smoke) pretty good . The calamari platter, it had fried and grilled, that too was okay. The jalape?o cheese balls, which has less jalape?o and more cheese so lets just call them cheese balls. 3 pizzas as the main course, chicken peri peri, asparagus and feta cheese and chicken jalape?o, all were good!  We also ordered 3 chipotle steaks(2 beef obe chicken) which were apparently the best out of all the dishes. The peri peri sandwich, which was a chicken burger(yes a burger) it was alright, not too amazing. The best thing we had were the sauces they gave with every dish, they charge for extra sauces we didnt know that and kept ordering away. For dessert we ordered the 4 tier chocolate cake, in my view this was nothing compared to espresso or nandos chocolate cake. a chocolate brownie with icecream, which was good and we got a complimentary creme br?l?e(thank god). Whoever ate it said it was good. All in all I think it was a good 7/10 in terms of food. 10/10 in terms of sauces. It was about 2000 per person including the drinks which I think led me to conclude that it is an overpriced version of Arizona and roasters!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-12T04:57:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-12T04:57:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"500405954","name":"Ayub Khuhro"},{"id":"546505351","name":"Tabraiz Marri"},{"id":"100006344564497","name":"Tuba Aisha"},{"id":"100000416623123","name":"Imran Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNDE2NjIzMTIz","before":"NTAwNDA1OTU0"}}},"restaurantName":"Arizona"},{"id":"165861103465048_600405926677228","from":{"name":"Khurrum Kamran","id":"1553970964"},"message":"For all thsoe who Dont have serious higine issues, try Bilal Broast  ka Breaos and beside is Hanfia, recomend their hunter beef burger, P.s Other Huanfia locations suck\n\nThis one is located at Food Street New town","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-08T21:41:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-09T09:43:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"1746319064","name":"Waqas Ahmed Khan"},{"id":"808230639","name":"Mariam Pardesi"},{"id":"644290279","name":"Fariyah Khan"},{"id":"100004993633855","name":"Mahzareen Mama"},{"id":"521220654","name":"Wamiq Akbani"},{"id":"659370395","name":"M Areeb Rehman"},{"id":"1311140673","name":"Yumna Salvatore"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTMxMTE0MDY3Mw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTE3Mjk1Njc5Mw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"600429530008201","from":{"name":"Hafsa Kasmani","id":"1407985203"},"message":"Hygiene *","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-08T22:35:34+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"600429663341521","from":{"name":"Khurrum Kamran","id":"1553970964"},"message":":o ^]","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-08T22:36:02+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"600441376673683","from":{"name":"Huda Paye","id":"896095572"},"message":"So how many people are there with no hygiene issue?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-08T23:21:41+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"600442590006895","from":{"name":"Alizeh Tariq Yahya","id":"100004416671310"},"message":"who would even have unhygienic by CHOICE","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-08T23:27:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"600443546673466","from":{"name":"Erum Hamza","id":"751819688"},"message":"used to be my favorite till my brother was getting it for us\nvisited the place once.. stopped having it anymore\nbut must say.. super delicious.. specially the masala filling one!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-08T23:30:48+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"600470033337484","from":{"name":"Khurrum Kamran","id":"1553970964"},"message":"I mean its a Low standard restaurant , they dont use gloves no hair nets.\nbut still its  really great :)\nIts the Top restaurant in My list, Unless it comes to Buffalo wings @ Arizona or Flaming wings @Pizza hut","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-09T00:47:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"600497146668106","from":{"name":"Nitty Shariq","id":"679264186"},"message":"Hanifya in Khadda Market is not unhygienic , as they do use gloves","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-09T02:21:51+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"600499490001205","from":{"name":"Nitty Shariq","id":"679264186"},"message":"Oh and this is not a restaurant but an outlet where u can go and buy","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-09T02:31:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"600507040000450","from":{"name":"AK Pasha","id":"100005736485212"},"message":"lol Huda Paye","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-09T02:53:49+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"896095572","name":"Huda Paye","type":"user","offset":4,"length":9}]},{"id":"600537623330725","from":{"name":"Haris Shaikh","id":"694723124"},"message":"Tell them.

I, along with a colleague went there for the reservations and woahh the management over there was very much concerned about the \"10% Service Charges\" as they kept on mentioning that I will have to pay 10% service charges on the bill since we are 15 people. I had no issues on service charges but did not like the way they kept on mentioning it so I had to say k \"Bhai Mil Jayein Gay Apko Don't worry\". Anyways, we went there at 6:00pm in the evening, ordered the food out of which 6 were steaks including Pepper Steak, 2 Arizona Fire Steak, Twin Steak, American something steak. Food was delivered \"Kiston Mein\" after 40 minutes. To our disappointment, all the steaks were served COLD and also they served Mexican Steak in Chicken instead of one Arizona Fire Steak. Had to return all the steaks and waited another 10 minutes for them to come back with the correct order. 4 Order were returned correctly but for the rest of 2 steaks (One of it was mine :() the waiter said that chef will have to make new steaks since they were medium rare and cant be cooked further so we will have to wait for another 20 to 25 minutes. This was the last nail in the coffin. I asked them to cancel my order and told them that you guys should not ask for service charges when you cant entertain your customers properly. You brought the food after 40 minutes, brought 1 wrong order, 6 cold steaks, made us wait further to get the food and now you are telling me that I have to wait another 20 minutes? Right after 2 minutes, waiter came back with a steak and told me that its on the house which I refused and told him that the free food tactic will not change our experience with your pathetic services. Rest of the people were done with their food by the time. Bill arrived and guess what.....THEY FELT NO SHAME IN PUTTING THE SERVICE CHARGES IN THE BILL. I have been to Zamzama's one and always appreciate their service but I must say that Atrium Mall's Arizona has shown me new horizons of pathetic services.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-07T14:57:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-08T10:40:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"672864677","name":"Aamir A.

I had the misfortune of ordering the chimichangas which were accompanied by ranch dressing (listed as 'Sour cream' on the menu), watered down chilli garlic sauce (listed as 'salsa') and two pitas (listed as 'flour tortillas'). When we complained to the waiters and even met the so-called manager, we were annoyed at how they really couldn't care less about our opinion. We insisted on speaking with the owner, but he didn't pick up his phone until about 2 hours later. Anyway, we left our half-eaten food and walked out - right infront of the 'manager' and waiters.

Situated up above Pearl Continental Hotel, the place was no less than magnificent when we walked in. The subtle ambiance, the pre-50's music playing, the extra-courteous waiters, I had a feeling it was going to be one amazing dinner. I had ordered the Chicken Dijon Steak and my friend ordered the Lobster Tail. After approximately twenty minutes of waiting, we had our food served to us. I can describe the food in one work, HORRIBLE! When a place is charging more than RS. 1000 per steak, one would obviously expect it to be amazing, but it was the worst steak I've had in the city. And don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind paying extra money if the food is worth it, sadly this wasn't even close. I would go as far as saying Arizona Grill serves better steaks than this place. It's terribly overpriced for the horrible food they serve. The portions were extra-small, and the steak tasted like something that would be made at home. I rank this high-class restaurant, not classy enough to go to.

Thought i would write about my experience. Ordered buffalo wings for starters, which were fine , but the ones at Arizona grill are better. Then ordered a steak for myself and a steak for my wife. Both came out really cold so asked for them to be warmed up. After 10 mins my wife's steak came out, Luke warm, she ate it anyways. My wife is a slow eater but she had finished her meal before my meal even came back. After it did come back the steak was hot but overdone. I thought I'd eat it anyway as I was hungry and didn't have much time. So when the bill came I asked to speak to the owner as I was not happy with my experience. If my wife and I go to a restaurant together we expect to eat together. He refused to see me and said he was too busy. So I paid the bill and went outside where he was greeting customers and taking bookings for that evening. I asked again if I could speak to him and he again said \"I'm too busy\" so I asked him if he really wanted me to discuss my experience at his restaurant infront of his customers who are waiting for a table and he replied \"do what you want\"\n\nNow I live in England and this sort of customer service would not suffice. The restaurant would fail for sure. I have been to many other restaurants in karachi and the customer service has been great. It's a shame that this owner cannot see that keeping his customers happy at the early stages of his restaurant is vital. I hope he learns from his mistakes as the actual deco of the place is nice and the menu (on paper) looks good. The owner is very friendly when taking your booking but when he's taken your money he turns rather obnoxious. In the end I got a very sarcastic \"I'm sorry I ruined your day\"\n\nNot great","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-24T04:58:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-25T12:29:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"688040667","name":"Farahnaz Haider Shaikh"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"603100292","name":"Abbas Bootwala"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"502247733","name":"Fouzia Oza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAyMjQ3NzMz","before":"NTAxNDE1NzE2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"403169863067503","from":{"name":"Farah Faraz","id":"697141034"},"message":"THAT is sad :S i was so hoping to go check out the new gunsmoke...but all i keep reading are these negative reviews :(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T05:11:25+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403183473066142","from":{"name":"Irum Ali","id":"100000226398562"},"message":"Kamran Sheikh...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T06:06:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"543024961","name":"Kamran Sheikh","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"403185403065949","from":{"name":"Masooma Dharamsey","id":"777621756"},"message":"I was going to check it out too, but I think I'll wait till I hear something positive about this place.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T06:13:20+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403190023065487","from":{"name":"Danish Raza","id":"578840177"},"message":"i was going to check it out today, now ive got doubts.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T06:31:07+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403190586398764","from":{"name":"Farah S.

The steaks were massive,both my kids couldn't eat them combined and even my pepper steak was very wholesome. Vegetable rice was freshly made and excellent to taste. The pepper steak well done was just right,juicy and tender with lot of charred onions, couldn't have asked for anything else, sorry Arizona Grill nothing like a steak served sizzling on the hot plate for 550 a piece instead of your cold and drab steak, which is not worth the price.Last but not the least Kulfi was well made and served hard with savienya. East or west Bbq tonite is the best, no match for service and value for money.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-11-30T21:30:08+0000","updated_time":"2011-11-30T21:30:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4","before":"MTQ0MjI3MTY4Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"restaurantName":"Arizona"}]}
