It was a successful event and we had a great time meeting new people :)  \n\nFirstly last night was one of the coldest nights by far and I thought we were going to turn into popsicles but thanks to the  management at Sajjad that didn't happen. It was unusually and surprisingly warm. Its covered from all sides and has fires burning at different spots which is really nice. So this answers the question for all who have been seeking a warm spot at do darya.\n\nNow to the FOOD.\nStarters: Chicken Dhakka, Hot and Sour Soup, BBQ prawns, lemon chicken and fish dhakka.\n\nMains: Afghani Boti, Chicken karhai, Shahi Handi.\n\nSTARTERS:\n? Chicken Dhakka: \n The most loved starter off all time I assume. It had been wiped clean off the dish as soon as it hit the table. Boneless chicken fried in a delicious batter served with this amazing sauce. Hands down the best dish on the menu and a must must try.\n\n?Hot & Sour Soup:\nDefiantly has room for improvement. But since we were sitting in a Pakistani themed Resturant i didn't expect a tiny Chinese man dancing out of my soup. So all good.\n\n?BBQ Prawns: \nOk i am not a seafood person at all. So according to the people who ate them they did enjoy. Its a very interesting dish. Plain simple flavours which enhanced the taste of the prawns \n\n?Lemon Chicken:\nAnother of my favorites. YUM i felt like im in chicken heaven. Crunchy chicken fried perfectly packed with that lemon zing. At the same time it didnt over power the chicken.\nI would keep going back for that.\n\n?Fish Dhaka:\nAnother one of the yummi delights. Me not being a sea food person fell for them like i slipped on a banana peel. \nMust try again. A complete winter dish\n\nMAINS:\nWe had stuffed our selfs with the starters lol\n\n?Chicken Karhai:\nJust has a taste but now i know why are they famous for it. Tasted yum.\n\n?Afghani Beef Boti:\nI can keep returning for that every single day. Soft, filled with taste, melts in the mouth. Neither to spicy neither bland just the right amount of spices.\n\n?Shahi Chicken Handi:\nA shahi handi for a shahi gathering lol. \nI love it. Boneless chicken chunks cooked in butter and topped with cheese and hints of fresh herbs. It has that yummy creamy subtle taste. Geez my mouth still waters for it. Total justice to the dish.\n\nOverall: \nGreat service.\nFood arrived hot and on time.\nAttentive staff.\nLoved the plastic covers against the wind. \n\nSpecial thankyou to all the foodies that showed up. \nHope to see u all soon.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-29T14:35:00+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-02T21:31:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"541880374","name":"Noreen Ahmed"},{"id":"100001434743152","name":"Raza Rehmani"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"100003570224157","name":"Kashif Khan"},{"id":"100001356574653","name":"Rude Plannet Kennel Rpk"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"532470690","name":"Sana Zaeem"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"887535136","name":"Jabbar Abdul"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"796000540","name":"Nisa Abdul Basit Khan"},{"id":"100001217752738","name":"MehRose Khan"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"729875068","name":"Soomro Ali"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"733018407","name":"Nabeel Kazi"},{"id":"100002943458913","name":"Aisha Wali Muhammad"},{"id":"1356485615","name":"Samrah Owais"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5MjA0NTUy","before":"MTAwMDA1NDIxODIzNTg4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_674208709296949/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzQ5MjA0NTUy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"674210079296812","from":{"name":"Zohaib Ali Memon","id":"524501080"},"message":"need to make it to one of these some day","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:38:13+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213699296450","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"So who all came?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:10+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213745963112","from":{"name":"Khozema Soni","id":"513558813"},"message":"If this event took place why was that girl siting alone ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:18+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674216695962817","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Khozema Soni well there was a bit of miscommunication.

First on the list was Fish hot and sour soup (white) which was the appetizer followed by the Dhaka finger fish the all time favorite, Jumbo prawn tempura and then the legendary Leather Jacket fillet in green masala, Fish Behari boti a new entrant as i had not tried it before, Pangush Boti Karahi,Chicken Fried Rice, Kids meal Crispy Chicken Burger Zinger,Garlic Nan, cold drinks and mineral water.\n\nOK, now for the mixed reviews i had been reading about Bots, well yes its has changed, it has evolved for the better and now is a proper food street fine dining dhaba style restaurant :)\nLimca stall was their earlier, now their a doc juice shop, i don't know the name of the doc but its good,dai bara stall and a pan stall plus loud music playing so the ambiance was definitely lively and more festive.\n\nNow coming to the revision in prices, yes their has been an slight increase in cost due to 16% GST but they are GST registered and the GST/SNTN is S3966140-7 and my bill had an addition of Rs.500, but rest assured it is being deposited in the national exchequer 100% which is cumulatively a substantial amount.\n\nThe real increase in prices is not that much considering they are delivering on quality and quantity, the fish was fresh, juicy, well marinated and had great flavor, as good as in the past if not better. The chatnis and the lemon add to the flavor too.\nThe service was quick and the food was served piping hot. Only one dish that was the Pangush Boti Karahi lacked flavor and was quite bland, i think that needs to be worked on and can improve with some minor adjustments.\n\nLadies and gentlemen Bots is known as the best seafood Dhabba in Karachi and upgraded its position now to a \"food street fine dining dhaba style restaurant\"\nnot a bad deal considering that a similar meal at a fine dining seafood joint would cost you 60% more with the frills and fancies, but as far as I am concerned the core issue is the product, and as long as I get value for money in terms of quality and quantity I am a happy camper indeed and plan to return to Bots soon for another round of scrumptious sea food delicacies.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-03T22:13:06+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-05T06:30:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"100000674735601","name":"Muhammad Patel"},{"id":"1004056348","name":"Zaryab Shaikh"},{"id":"100001433820134","name":"Hasan Raza"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"1413795365","name":"Hiba Jamali"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"521735682","name":"Aamir Shahnawaz"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"593601228","name":"Muhammad Saifullah"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100000446704703","name":"Almas Mehmood"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"564100900","name":"Fawad Hai"},{"id":"645099594","name":"Mujahid Iqbal"},{"id":"100002698452985","name":"Rabia Mahmood"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjk4NDUyOTg1","before":"MTE5ODgzMTM3Ng\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"644634672254353","from":{"name":"Mahad Mustafa","id":"805150435"},"message":"Syed Zulfiqar Ali Kazmi!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-03T22:58:39+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"585210551","name":"Syed Zulfiqar Ali Kazmi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":23}]},{"id":"644851935565960","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Oh I see it now.

(My dad is an ultimate nakhray wale uncle:p like the one who calls a steak gosht ka tukda, a pizza 'roti utay boti' and so on) so I always opt for desi with dad since he tends to be very particular with expense directly proportional to taste! Went for an early dinner to Khanji and were seated immediately (1. the weather was lovely, I loved how I ate desi with those back support chairs I could sink into after a long tedious day). Moving to the menu, really extensive, efficiently put together... Ordered Mutton Peshaweri Karhai, Shish Taouk...on asking about the serving we were told there would be 6 pieces so we order yet another 2 items (we dint know they wudnt be tiny pieces, instead king kong pieces) ordered fish tikka and Namkeen Boti. Dad was disappointed for no tandoori roti and only having chapati as an option! Waiter immediately said they can get from another eatery and so we ordered both\nPumpkin Meetha(I don't eat pumpkins, cant say much :))\nThe POST MORTEM:\nMutton Peshaweri Karhai: Nothing like those al habib or Kolachi tastes! Distinct flavors, loved how tender the meat was (I do not eat mutton apart from home but i surprisingly did!). Maybe the right tinge of Peshawer 10/10\n\nNamkeem Boti: I thought they'd be somehow salty (Namkeem wohi hota hai na?) But I think well marinated Chicken with an unbelievably managed execution, 10/10\n\nShish Taouk: A different version of Malai Boti, perhaps with some arabic spices maybe? (y m i being a chef? lol I'd rate it 8/10)\n\nFarmaishi Chapatti : Loved it, literally chapati had some peshaweri khan baba ki rooh in it maybe? The tandoori rotiz kept sadofying while we had our hands onto the chapati\n\nFish Tikka: Uff...Uff...Uff...

Did not even bother checking them this time. I love my food but waiting an hour plus for being seated is a buzzkill for me, heck it's even longer then it takes me to eat sometimes. Hence Kolachi was a BIG NO... *sigh*\n\nEnded up going to Al Sajjad as it's become quite a favorite of mine during the last couple of months.\nTook hardly around 5 mins to be seated (im very picky about seating). Must say I love it better then the others, it's not too crowded (means lesser people staring at us eating while they wait :p) and iv always gotten amazing service and taste with next to no time wastage ..\n\nNow Food...\nOrdered Fish Dhaka and Chicken Dhaka, Lemon Chicken, Malai Boti, and Chicken Karhai..\nBoth Fish and Dhaka Chicken tasted amazing as ever. Crunchy on the outside and soft inside. The quantity was very generous plus the taste which made it impossible to keep my hand away hence I was quite full to attack the others.\n\nLemon chicken was creamy with a hint of lime.\n\nDid not have the stomach to try the malai boti and karhai but the family loved it, so il take their word for it. \n\nOne extra point for how carefully they pack the left over food upon request. Proper tiny boxes, was warm even when I opened it at home. \n\nYet again they have managed to make me very happy. Great food and even better service. *Double Thumbs Up*\n\nOne little advice though, I would appreciate a better choice of music in the background.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-16T19:29:28+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T09:50:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"524835210","name":"Ali Dayo"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"1385831564","name":"Mehvish Ayaz"},{"id":"100002698452985","name":"Rabia Mahmood"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"511130593","name":"Layla Rizvi"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"620585988","name":"Midhat Mirza"},{"id":"1053980754","name":"Wajeeha Amir"},{"id":"512612823","name":"Leena Faruqui"},{"id":"100000533457073","name":"Tooba Saleem Rindani"},{"id":"687185098","name":"Syed Fawad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg3MTg1MDk4","before":"MTAwMDAyNTQ4OTcxNjE3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619768214740999","from":{"name":"Syed Fawad","id":"687185098"},"message":"Yes  true I think in nearby future this strip of rest at Do darya might shutdown  down soon & I luv the view from each rest kolachi , ambalA , al sajad &many more I luv the food there , view is amazing value if money is also good","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T19:45:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619768324740988","from":{"name":"Syed Fawad","id":"687185098"},"message":"Value of money *","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T19:45:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619774244740396","from":{"name":"Zahid Ali Shahid","id":"2531013"},"message":"Ur like obsessed with Sajjad, lol.

Its just amazing how Mr Big with Egg n Cheese is perfect every time . It feels like they have time frozen the entire process for the last 20 years . Succulent , Flavoursome , Juicy Satisfaction all wrapped up in One little Piece of Heaven. I'd rate it 12/10 , 2 extra points for that smile on my face every time I take the first bite.\n\n2- Al Asif Square : Though a bit risky for some fellows but to be honest the place was packed . We had food at MADINA RESTAURANT which is located inside Al Asif Square and to some people's surprise there were few families around there as well ( well to do families at that ) enjoying food , the atmosphere was friendly we were greeted as warmly as always . We had the famous Dumba Boti , Afghani Pulao , Namkeen Gosht and Karahi.  Now i don't want to waste time in describing the brilliance of food . \nThat is the best Authentic Afghani food out there, Period , 11/10 . One extra point for the Afghan brethren for their every gracious hospitality. \n\n3- Tayyabi Restaurant : Located in Hussainabad. It one of the few unsung heroes of Karachi. We ordered Prawn Masala , KataKat , Chicken Chargha Fry, Malai Boti and Tikkas . Food was served a bit late as they prepare all the dishes fresh and from the scratch. \nPrawn Masala is one of the best in town as the prawns just melt in your mouth and mix with that zesty masala . THE DAMN ! \n\nKatakat and Chicken Chargha fry are good too . All in all yet another place you wont come out unsatisfied or cheated, EVER . 8/10 . -2 for the stolen side mirror of my friend's car from the parking :P\n\n4-  The Burger Shack: I have Shake Shack every week so it did not impressed me much. But i'd like to commend the owner for doing the best damn possible thing by cloning a famous international franchise's menu and making it possible to offer taste in it as well. I was not disappointed to say the least. 7/10\n\n5- Cafeela : Simply put , Zahoor bhai you rock . Okra Jalfarezi , Malai Boti , Nathiya Gali Qeema , Shahi Tukray , Chicken Yakhni Pulao are all yum. One of the best value for money in town. \n\nI am a safe eater and a Desi at heart as I get to eat really yummy mum cooked food and these are few of the places I go to eat or get food delivered when I want to eat out.

We went to KhanJi at Port Grand. The first thing that struck us (in a good way) was that it's located at the farthest end of the walk and offers amazingly calm environment.. Our table was ready and it was right at the edge giving us a great view of the port and the light drizzle made the whole environment great..\n\nNow to food, having searched (Yes searched using the option on the top right of the group ;) ) the reviews of the place on SWOT we ordered Peshawari Karahi, Afghani White Karahi, Shish Touk, Chicken Namkeen Boti, and Mutton Ribs..Everything we ordered was ready on time, served hot and everyone loved the food.. They didn't have tandoori Naan in their menu but they granted our wish to serve Naan with the food and they arranged it from some other restaurant.. After the food we ordered Doodh patti and Kashmiri Chai which was really really good and was very refreshing since we all went there straight from work and really needed it..\n\nThe highlight of our experience was the attentiveness of their staff... From the manager who greeted us at the entrance to every waiter everyone was trying their best..\n\nOverall it was a 10/10 experience for us.. Excellent place..

So yesterday I decided to give them a visit. And with no surprises, everything I heard was true. Endless variety of food including BBQ, Chinese, Handi, Afghani, Italian,etc. ,etc., and what not. Although, the differentiating factor which separates Kolachi from all other infinite menu list buffets in town, each and every item was fresh and scrumptious and hard to resist, making it impossible to taste all of them. Specialties being Prawn tempura, Malai Boti, Paneer Reshmi, OOzi and Karhai. These are items for which you definitely need reserve some space in your appetite. And what to say about desserts, simply divine and celestial.\nA few negligible cons, long ques on high running items but visible efforts by staff to manage the crowd.  Secondly, when I called them two days back to reserve the water front table, I was told that they are not making reservations. Therefore I made sure to reach max by 6:15 pm, and was told that all water front tables are already reserved!!!!!

Mirage is the only buffet themed restaurant at Do-Darya and is located right next to Kolachi. The ambience is nothing to write about as it?s almost the same as Kolachi, Charcoal, etc. We booked the whole upper deck unanimously for the view and later regretted the decision as the main food stations were downstairs.\nThe food stations are divided into 3 areas. The main food station is at the entrance while the BBQ section is at the upper left corner of the restaurant. The dessert and salad bar is in the top right corner.\nFor the price (Rs. 1000 per person inclusive of 1 soft drink) the food was very good. There were fresh batair?s (better than Lal-Qila?s), fried prawn tempura, Chicken Biryani, Goan Fish Curry, Chapli Kabab, pani puri are just some of the dishes that were tasted. The highlights however were the BBQ and the live chicken Karhai. The BBQ consisted of Chicken Malai Boti, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Chicken Tikka and Beef Namkeen Boti. The Malai Boti was succulent (but a little sweet for my taste) while Reshmi Kabab and Tikka were awesomely cooked (and Thank God not overcooked)  bu the Beef Namkeen Boti stole the show as it literally melted in our mouths.\nThe Karhai also has 4 varieties namely Peneer White, Peshawari Red, Green Masala and Namkeen Red Karhai. All four varieties were delicious and much better than what Kolachi serves.\nThe let down at Mirage were the salad and dessert station due to same variety as other buffets and also fried fish and the pasta dishes.\nOverall we really enjoyed our food and had a fantastic evening.

(Valet Parking - thank God) No reservations, but we were ushered to our seats in a matter of moments, lovely view. Opted for the Desi stuff. Ordered Peshawari Karahi, Malai Boti, Beef Seekh Kebab, Mutton Masla Chops and some boti's (forgot the name....Maybe Hunza boti's ?)..... Food prepared and arrived within 15 minutes accompanied with Puri Paratha, Kolachi Naan and Roghni Naan. Everything was delicious, my favourite were the Mutton Masala Chops and the Karahi. Floor Manager presented himself to us half way through and asked us if everything was to our liking esp food temp, quality and taste, and was very genuine in his offer to change anything which we thought was not to our satisfaction.

Prepared and served hygienically in disposable containers/plates.  Though I am not a Zinger type burger fan, however, people rave about Cool Inn's Zinger clone.  The masala dossa is also pretty decent and the Spicy Chicken Boti Bun has a unique flavour (be cautioned its really really spicy).  They also make a  great faluda and the cold-stone ice cream (which they call as Katakat Ice Cream) is very good for the price.  Love their dark chocolate flavour and have it  \"Katakated\" with Soft Mints with a topping of chocolate sauce.  They serve the Katakat Ice Cream in a waffle cup which is crispy and delicious.  A whole variety of ice cream flavours is available to suit all tastes. Cool Inn is a must visit place for all Chaat lovers.  Its great value for money.  The owner Noor Bhai is always present there and ensures quality and hygeine.  All their chutneys are made with mineral water and cooking/frying is done in Soya Supreme/Rafhan Corn Oil.
