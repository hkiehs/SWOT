Laziest and the most unprofessional service one can imagine!\n\nCalled to ask if order (Biryani Centre) can be placed via phone. The operator said that due to a large number of orders, it is not possible to take orders via phone. Please order through the website or app.\n\nNext thing - order placed on the website within 5 minutes, at 6.12pm. Called myself just to confirm if they had received it and expected delivery time etc. Four attempts, call drops each time it gets to the operator. \n\nAnnoyed. Called Indus Foods directly and placed the order. Called foodpanda again to cancel the order. Three more attempts but still can't get through. Indus Foods order arrives within 30 mins. All is well with the countdown to iftar until...\n\n7.09pm - SMS, email and call - all received simultaneously from foodpanda! The operator started with 'I'd like to confirm your order. Your order will be delivered within 50 minutes'. When I told him to cancel the order due to super late response, the operator dares to go ahead with his FIRST LIE: 'Due to the long order queue, confirmation calls are SLIGHTLY late'. Hmm... 60 minutes late - are they that understaffed? Nah! They must be getting a zillion orders by the minute. Good for the pandas.\n\nAsked him to cancel the order but he wouldn't budge. Told him 60 mins of no response (plus 50 mins delivery time starting from this minute) is not acceptable. Even if I confirm now, it'll take the order minimum 15 mins to get here, wont it? Then the operator dares to lie for the second time: \"Your order was being processed. It will be there any moment. Let me coordinate with Biryani Centre, the rider might just be outside your gate even.\"\nSo now orders are being delivered without any confirmation? Interesting.\n\nWhen I questioned him on how he had initially called to confirm and then said the rider might be at my gate (in which case calling was futile anyway), the operator continued to digress or argue. Told him he's welcome to 'confirm and forward' the order to Biryani Centre but, if and when it arrives, it won't be collected or paid for since he's flatly refusing to cancel the order.\n\nWhile I'd like to believe the refusal thing worked in getting the order cancelled, I hope a Biryani Centre rider does not show up at my gate any time now. After all, its been only 2 hours since they called. One never knows, due to their 'order queue', they may well (forcefully) deliver after 6-8 hours.\n\nPoor service is one thing. Lies on top of lies to refuse mistakes are an altogether different thing. Wishing the pandas all the best with their zillion orders. May they make enough money to invest in reliable systems and half a decent customer service that has some integrity.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-06T16:09:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-07T05:54:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"837380646","name":"Maliha Abidi"},{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"611720320","name":"Quratulaien Tanveer"},{"id":"579933313","name":"Ali Daudpota"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"653913361","name":"Ahmed I Mehanti"},{"id":"515216311","name":"Ammar Ather"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"100000635773324","name":"Shariq Nazr"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNjM1NzczMzI0","before":"NTQ3NDY1MjE0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"599364300114724","from":{"name":"Shehzad Ghias Shaikh","id":"504565020"},"message":"Must be an off day, deliveries around iftaar time can be a mess especially with the traffic in the city in the last couple of days.
