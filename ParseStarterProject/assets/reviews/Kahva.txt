The chicken slice was very tender. I am a great fan of sandwiches especially the CLUB and I must say this one is the best in town and even left the X anders one behind. \nThe thin crust pizza was amazing too and I felt it was better than Bella vita,  though my wife was a bit doubtful. \nDel frio is doing great","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-01T04:51:14+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-02T06:47:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"1448923606","name":"Beenish Sohaib"},{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"685460614","name":"Nida Sattar-Saad"},{"id":"1259026324","name":"Raheel Qadri"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"1064185636","name":"Ramsha Abid"},{"id":"100000744651030","name":"Farah Sadiq"},{"id":"647150297","name":"Mehreen Faisal"},{"id":"100003946326335","name":"Noureen Zahid"},{"id":"509630499","name":"Shahzeen Shahid Siddiqui"},{"id":"200900469","name":"Hassan Ashfaq"},{"id":"541276134","name":"Omer Jawed"},{"id":"1079332060","name":"Farheen Omer"},{"id":"807020133","name":"Mehreen Ahmed"},{"id":"780560073","name":"Anita Zeeshan Al-Najjar"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"535065551","name":"Hassan Khan"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"100001881992250","name":"Anum Rasheed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxODgxOTkyMjUw","before":"MTAwMDAwMzQ5ODA0NzU0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"643166572401163","from":{"name":"Nilofar Tariq","id":"100001715527819"},"message":"I would want to know where is it exactly located plz....","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-01T05:28:01+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"643167709067716","from":{"name":"Hassan Khan","id":"535065551"},"message":"it is really very good. its at sindhi muslim !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-01T05:32:03+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"643168295734324","from":{"name":"Asim Abdul Razzaq","id":"1379490729"},"message":"Sindhi Muslim A block, near the Old and famous HYDER AND ROYAL and just opposite Kahva","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-01T05:34:54+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"643171132400707","from":{"name":"Ali Nadeem","id":"100001691885342"},"message":"Del Frio sucks","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-01T05:49:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"643172795733874","from":{"name":"Ahsan Ahmed","id":"651969947"},"message":"^ such a detailed insight on why a place 'sucks'","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-01T05:51:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"643174009067086","from":{"name":"Asim Abdul Razzaq","id":"1379490729"},"message":"Can you explain why do you think it sucks?\nI have been there 3 times and every time i have found it good.

Because after insisting on how we didnt want to go for a buffet, we actually ended up going to an all you can eat. Cafe 76 is one of my favorite places and after reading such good comments about their iftar i even booked a table there, but somehow my friend was in a mood for desi food. So we ended up going to bbq tonight. I think their iftari was fine. Not extra ordinary. And im used to them being spot on with every dish...hence i was even a bit disappointed. For instance, the bihari boti wasnt well done. And i also felt that having one buffet spread for the entire floor isnt a good idea. The place was packed with people and while getting our food we had to almost elbow our way through the crazy line. One nice thing was that we went without any reservation and their manager was super nice to us and managed to get us a table. There were many people standing, waiting for a table to get arranged in that crowded place, but i guess we were extremely lucky to get seated right away while all of them waited :P\nAll in all, not a bad experience..but honestly at one point i did wish i had talked my friend into going to cafe 76 instead.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-15T03:57:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDI0MzI0NzY3NjE4Njc5","before":"NDIzNjQ1NzUxMDE5OTE0"}}},"restaurantName":"Kahva"},{"id":"165861103465048_419817911402698","from":{"name":"Tehreem Fatima","id":"892195391"},"message":"reviews for Kahva? any iftar deal up?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-02T12:14:46+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-02T12:14:46+0000","restaurantName":"Kahva"},{"id":"165861103465048_418041114913711","from":{"name":"Sundus Qasim","id":"1213637082"},"message":"Has anyone tried Gloria Jeans?
