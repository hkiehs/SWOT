Booking was not on the go, they gave us a waiting time of 1.5 hours, which later converted in to 2 hours. the food came after 30 minutes (which is \"OK\"). though in between i was hearing different fights in the row of the booking counter due to exceeding the allocated time for seat bookings. thus, the place and the environment was fortunately awesome!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-11T10:06:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-11T10:06:39+0000","restaurantName":"Foresters house of grill"}]}
