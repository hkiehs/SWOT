(3/10). \nfish and chips for the kid (6/10). add more fries please. and don't count them.\n\nwhat i did not like about the sizzler was when the order was being taken, we should have been asked how do we want it done. well that did not happen so i was thinking maybe that was not an option. \n\ni was amazed with the presentation, i loved it. when we opened up the beef chunks, blood every where. i think it was done \"rare\" well we did not order rare, so i ask for the waiter tell him to get us a well done. specifically told him to make a new one for us, he brings it back to us in 10 mins. says its well done. i open it up again, and yet again the blood. turns out, it was the same old one just more caramelised. was about time, so i could not wait or take more, asked for the bill. was surprised to see the surf n turf added there. \n\nthe waiter/manager explained he had arranged a 15% discount for me in the bill in order to cover up the screw up. well dear patio, that does not cover up the bill for the sizzler, neither does it cover the wait time, nor it covers the experience i wanted to share, i wont post pics here, i could not take them. did not have a good phone on me at that time. but i did take the picture of the feedback card. \n\ni think i should not have been charged for what i did not eat and what was not edible to eat. i mean i like rare when i want rare, today we did not want rare, nor we did want second hand cooked rare. \n\ni think a chef who does not understand the difference between rare and well done, might just not be the person for a place like you.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-08-29T18:20:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-30T07:17:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"674095744","name":"Nadia Rauf"},{"id":"693890937","name":"Hafsa Akhtar"},{"id":"1257283317","name":"Aymun Zafar"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1147238309","name":"Abdul Sami"},{"id":"703270112","name":"Hiba Shuja"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzAzMjcwMTEy","before":"Njc0MDk1NzQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"611411148910039","from":{"name":"Asif Rasheed Ghani","id":"1224016566"},"message":"This is hilarious :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-29T18:31:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"611411478910006","from":{"name":"Kanwal Saeed","id":"773207375"},"message":"I went to The Patio on monday.

It is obviously in our best interest to provide high quality service, which is why keep a set menu.

In the middle our gas went to next to nothing for about half an hour (not using that as an excuse). Once a few orders back up, well its a lot like the domino effect during rush hour. It should be rather obvious that we have no intention of  providing bad service or giving anyone a less than perfect experience. If that was the case, then Im pretty sure then we're in the wrong industry. Iit was a rather overwhelming response that night and some issues did occur. That being said, being a restaurant we dont penalize guests when the make reservations for a certain time and casually walk in half an hour late. Sure, it makes life difficult for us - but hey thats what hospitality is all about to provide excellent service.

Nezihe to answer your question, our primary reason to have a special set menu was to offer certain dishes which were not on our menu & would give our patrons something new to try. Also with a set menu, you can customize it for the particular day, thus for valentines we were able to offer Chocolate Fondue with fresh fruits, Grilled Lobster & our Red Snapper plus much more within the set menu.

However, I have been to Forty4 several times in small and large groups and at various times of the week / lunch / dinner. One of the most consistently noticeable comments from my friends has been to acknowledge the service in addition to the food quality, selection and value. That said, I am sure that there have been issues as Aman Virji has acknowledged. For the record, I would not hesitate to take groups of friends or professional colleagues to Forty4! One restaurant that remains unmentioned is Pompeii which should be in the running as they do meet all the same standards that Forty4 has for our dining experiences. Have not been to Thyme or The Patio so I cannot comment, although others have said good things about both places ... especially The Patio. Aylanto has disappointed us multiple times with respect to food and at our last visit, we actually left without eating due to issues with the attitude of the staff. For that reason, we have not been to Aylanto for many months now and therefore things could be very different by now so it is hard for me to offer anything more than our prior experiences while acknowledging the passage of time. Okra is not a place we have visited very often but many of our friends go there and I have never heard anything but glowing reports about the food with the only cautionary factors being the small size of the restaurant and sometimes the availability of reservations. Cafe Flo has its diehard fans or people like me who feel that it is nice enough but not among our first choices.

It's gotta be one of the prettiest places to eat at in Karachi, and they have added splashes of color that made the place even more lively.\n\nOrdered 2 doodh patties and 2 house blend cinnamon elaichi chai...\nAnd one walnut chocolate chip pudding with chocolate sauce. And one banofee pie. While ordering I asked the waiter what were these served with as in ice cream or cream.....he said neither. S we asked him to bring us some scoops in a bowl. \n\nThe teas were fresh and aromatic. Thu doodh patti has to be had at a dhaaba, but this was pretty good, MSK loved the house blended. Te desserts were interesting but I found the walnut pudding a little dry on the inside. The banofee was quite authentic but a little TOO rich and dense. It was left over even with 4 people attacking it. \n\nAlong with a big bottle of mineral water and tip it was 300/- a head.\n\nThe weather is becoming totally Koel Worthy.

The ambience is dominated by dim lights and warm colours that give a welcoming feel as soon as one enters the restaurant. \n\nWe skipped the starters and went right on to the mains.I was in the mood for a non meaty, desi dish and opted for vegetable thali. Friends ordered chicken tournedo and Tokyo fish. My thali was perfect to fulfill my craving for desi food! It had white rice, palak paneer, daal, pakora curry, potatos, achaar and raita along with halwa and puris and crisp papads! The daal was a little bland and did not taste the way I was expecting it to. However, that was the only slight flaw in an otherwise spectacular dish which is a great option for vegetarians.\n\nMy friend seemed reasonably satisfied with her order of Tokyo fish. I never like ordering a chicken dish because usually it gets dry and tasteless but the few bites of Chicken tournedos that I had from my friend?s plate made me change my views about chicken. It was juicy and packed full of the most amazing flavours. Our server had recommended this dish and the way he described it made us hungry. Will definitely be having it again! The dark chocolate sabayon was the perfect dessert to end our meal. It had the right balance of sweet peaches and dark chocolate. \n\nOne thing that really matters to me is service. The staff here has been trained to stay attentive and to give helpful suggestions when asked. We sat for quite a while even after the bill had been paid and were not rushed in any way. I would definitely be going to The Patio again to try out more dishes and ofcourse, to have their chicken tournedos :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-22T15:43:28+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-22T16:27:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"682241004","name":"Atif Malik"},{"id":"589485566","name":"Murwah Tariq-Atif"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"509507958","name":"Omair Ahmed"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjY4OTYxNDAz","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"402235639827592","from":{"name":"Danyal Achria","id":"582960575"},"message":"Alisa Zulfiqar Thanks a lot for trying us out and were extremely glad you and your friends had a good time and enjoyed the food.

Food tastes are subjective and you can't please everyone, which is why it's so difficult to decide on a restaurant with a large group. when everyone wants something else, Patio has sort of become the default place to go to. Some of us love it, others think its ok, but we all always have a good time when we go. When one friend didn't like the drink she ordered, our very accommodating waiter brought her a complementary replacement later he brought a complementary ice tea as well. There was a small hair in one of the entrees but as soon as it was pointed out, the meal was replaced. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable, almost like you are eating at home or at a friends place and that homemade feel comes across in the food too, which i love","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T15:14:03+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-14T11:24:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1444911129","name":"Huma Elahi"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"100002147223760","name":"Sada Chachar"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzA4MDI1NDkx","before":"MTQ0NDkxMTEyOQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397324660318690","from":{"name":"Shaikh Fawad","id":"694238742"},"message":"mrs. shaikh here... patio has turned  out to be a welcome and pleasent surprise addition to the dining scene in karachi... happy to see that others are enjoying too...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T15:32:24+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"397358103648679","from":{"name":"Danyal Achria","id":"582960575"},"message":"Hala Anjum Syed  Thanks a lot & were glad you had a positive experience at The Patio.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T16:53:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"515754753","name":"Hala Anjum Syed","type":"user","offset":0,"length":15}]},{"id":"397675743616915","from":{"name":"Talha Iqbal Mufti","id":"650155499"},"message":"yeah we had a good time. the guy attending to us said his name is niazi. hr was good, should be treated as a valued employee. very attentive n quick. i had chickrn tournado n since i dont like olives, this lady herself came n explained how n why olives couldnt be avoided entirely. that helped me undetstand n i had some olives anyway. i didnt mind, details help sometimes. n the tomato basil soup was good. but we mias the elderly lady who used to ne around earlier. we used to go to patio just bcoz of her","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-14T05:48:27+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"397738953610594","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"Thinking about going there for my birthday.

It allows me to suggest new places to friends and relatives, even if I haven't been there, simply based on everyone else's reviews. My sister called me up tonight, and asked for dining out suggestions with my brother in-law. I suggested The Patio. Once they got there, my sister called up yet again, asking for suggestions. I told her to go on and order the Chicken Tournedos, since she's not a beef person, and any tapas on the menu. So, my brother in-law ordered the corn cakes, which he enjoyed, and then the Laal Maas Rajasthani for his entr?e. My sister stuck to my suggestion and they loved the experience. They also got a complimentary bread basket with butter, and once their server noticed the butter had finished, got over a second one. My sister told me the bread basket was fresh and yummy, and the service was courteous and welcoming. They also found the decor appealing and cozy. They forgot to pick up the leftovers they had requested to have packed for takeaway, and were walking away from the restaurant when a server ran up to them with the food. My sister was heaping praises on the service, food and ambiance, which was within an extremely reasonable price range for such a lovely experience. Thank you, Patio people!

Taking into account the sort of reviews this place is getting, you either love the place or hate it. I for one loved it. I have come back to Patio  after a good 2/3 years and this place has certainly transformed. I was quite unimpressed with my last and only visit it and rated the place as quite mediocre. It is very very different now. \n\nThe decor has certainly improved, making the place look much more alive, modern and cozy. The service was prompt and friendly with the waiters seeming quite informed. I tried the Tapas Platter and Cheese Fondue for starters. I did not like the Cheese Fondue but loved the (baked?) mushrooms and Wasabi Pineapple Prawns. The prawns had a very interesting flavoring, the mixture of wasabi and pineapple did wonders to it. Highly recommended to be ordered on their own. \n\nFor the main course I ended up ordering the Tokyo Fish, apparently it is one of their signature dishes. It is Penguasis fish, batter fried. Crispy from the outside and very delicate from the inside. It is accompanied by garlic fried rice and spinach. Simply superb.\n\nFor the dessert I had Choco-bans which were just brilliant. Spring roll like concoction which are stuffed with bananas. They too were really really good. \n\nThough there is certainly room for improvement as my friends who ordered Mutton Maas were not really impressed with it. One even remarked that the portions were small. These are the areas that ought to be looked at. But overall a great experience. I personally see a good future for this place if they fine tune it a little more.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T20:06:38+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372078126176677","from":{"name":"Shaikh Fawad","id":"694238742"},"message":"started it all w/ the Cheese Fondue which was a very gud start, rich, but not too heavy, & not at all processed:))) the array of Tapas\u003cmentioned above\u003e were really gr8too\u003clight, tasty, wonderfully flavorful, in other words subtle, but sexy:\u003e....steak au gratin (medium) was the best dish on the table\u003cstaff was attentive, i improvised my steak w/ finely chopped ginger, really enhances the flavors:\u003e, done to perfection, and generous enough to feed the whole table:D, and the Peanut butter mousse\u003cin a deliciously edible chocolate cup:\u003e &Naughty Toffee were the perfect end to an already gr8 evening.....gud work PATIO!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T20:51:43+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372093282841828","from":{"name":"Asghar Khan","id":"100001971572016"},"message":"1250 per head with drinks and water + tips +tax can you break dawn just for information...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T21:20:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372107876173702","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"the total bill was 9005 - we rounded it to a even 1250 per person. just easy math.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T21:48:31+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372219232829233","from":{"name":"Danyal Achria","id":"582960575"},"message":"Faisal Naseer & Shaikh Fawad Thanks a lot for the review.

It was average at best. Realized after seeing it that one should not go for desi at a place like The Patio, so obviously it was more of a wrong choice made (If I wanted desi, I should've just listened to Sarah J.K and ordered the BBQ Platter). Having said the cheese fondue I felt was extremely good and not at all too cheesy :P. The Tapas platters like everyone else mentioned were brilliant. The desserts were out of this world, even though the raving reviews for the naughty toffee, i felt the peanut butter oreo mousse was even better. It was to my liking sweeeeeeetness galore, the naughty toffee wasn't as sweet as this. So I guess for people who don't have too much of a sweet tooth the toffee will do. Service was one of if not the best at any restaurant. If ever one needed anything, you'd look up and the server would be right there, Top notch stuff. Another thing a couple of us thought were that the portions were a bit small, but keeping the per head cost in mind afterwards, didn't seem as bad.

The tapas were great - paneer kalimiri, corn cakes & wasabi prawns were perfect. For the main course we ordered surf'n'turf and tokyo fish which were cooked beautifully as well. The only thing i didnt enjoy were the patio prawns. The sauce was a bit bland for my liking and the prawns a bit small and chewy. Wanted to try the choco ban but we were stuffed. After a long time i've visited a place where i didnt feel like i'd already tried more than half the things on the menu. Great job Saima Achria! Will bring my mom over soon to try the desi stuff on your menu. The thali and Rajmah looked very tempting :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-02T10:36:01+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-02T11:19:58+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"579820606","name":"Smita Byramji Mama"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjY4OTYxNDAz","before":"NTE4MzA4MDg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"371130409604782","from":{"name":"Sarah J.K","id":"708025491"},"message":"I know! their menu is so refreshing","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-02T11:07:29+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"371134296271060","from":{"name":"Danyal Achria","id":"582960575"},"message":"Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi Thanks a lot.

Got personalized service by Danyal Achria which was really really nice since they were out of the platter due to rush, yet it was arranged. A++ for service\n\nThe food was AMAZING. my mum found it a LITTLE salty but I really loved it the way it was. The masala was well balanced, tinge of spice but explosions of flavor.\n\nI couldn't have the paratha because I'm on no a no-carb diet but it looked so good I wanted to just devour it. Kept that aside for my dad!\n\nNow for the cons:\nTook a little longer than expected and the Khadim Online guy kept calling me sounding irritated - but whatever it was worth the wait\n\nCouple of pieces of the chicken drumstick (tikka) were slightly undercooked so had to leave the inside bit. Everything else was cooked to perfection\n\na little pricey I suppose, but considering the quantity - 2 people can easily enjoy it. \n\nkudos I have found my favorite new barbecue dish.\n\u003c3","type":"status","created_time":"2012-04-29T18:29:06+0000","updated_time":"2012-04-30T04:05:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE5MjM1ODcz","before":"NTE4MzA4MDg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"369565506427939","from":{"name":"Danyal Achria","id":"582960575"},"message":"Sarah J.K Thanks a lot for the review on the BBQ-Platter. At the time you had placed your order we had just ran out of the marinated meat for the platter & also we were not taking anymore orders due to being fully booked. Since i had spoken to you the day earlier i really wanted to ensure you got it the next day no matter what. I Apologize for the tikka being slightly undercooked & for the delay. Also the platter can now be customized so whenever you order you can switch it up as per your preference. Regarding the price, I will try and also offer the platter in reduced quantities and make it suitable for one person. Therefore if your ordering just for yourself you wont have to pay the full price. Thanks & hope to see you soon at The Patio.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-04-30T01:34:09+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K","type":"user","offset":0,"length":9}]},{"id":"369566699761153","from":{"name":"Sarah J.K","id":"708025491"},"message":"Hey Danyal, thanks a ton for your response.

Their food is just as great as I have always found it. Had the Honeyed Lotus stems and melting mushrooms for starters. Those mushrooms TRULY melt in your mouth and lotus stems fritters/ slices were to die for with the spicy honeyed sauce. Was a bit wary ordering a \"honeyed\" main course too but was pleasantly surprised that both tasted completely different and absolutely delicious. The honey chilli prawns with spinach (not soggy mashed-y one, but a slight twist to the regular way of serving spinach) and garlic rice was divine. Their Badam Sherbet was a bit too sweet for someone who likes a moderately sweet drink/ dish. For me it was heavenly. This place has never let me down. Quite honestly.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-16T17:31:17+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-16T17:57:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"512386146","name":"Bilal Hassan"},{"id":"502451353","name":"Bilal Rashid"},{"id":"643423090","name":"Junaid Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQzNDIzMDkw","before":"NTgyOTYwNTc1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"278953545489136","from":{"name":"Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi","id":"684515056"},"message":"sounds like a great order. will def visit soon as i believe the lotus stems are not in stock always.
