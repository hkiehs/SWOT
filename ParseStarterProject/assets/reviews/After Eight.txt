Enjoy!\n\nToday was my first time attending a blogger's meet at the soon-to-open Bella Vita. So exciting! Located right next to the Pizza Hut lane at Zamzama, this outlet is difficult to miss with its massive awning. Even with my lack of direction sense, I managed to make it without any difficulty at all. Upon entering, I had to silently admit to myself that this was one prettily dressed up place. It gave a very warm, welcoming vibe, where you can just imagine sitting yourself at a corner table in the comfy chair large enough to fit two people (At least for me) for as long as you wish to, with a cup of your favorite coffee and a good book. There was wooden paneling, tasteful painting interspersed along the walls, and amidst all the masculine brown paneling, femininely attired chandeliers hung at various intervals from the wooden ceiling. There was enough seating to accommodate a party of six or a table for two, interspersed with an assortment of comfortable looking lounging-type chairs, and the regular wooden chairs. \n\nUpon meeting the owners, I could see that the welcoming and comfortable atmosphere of Bella Vita was a reflection of their personalities. More than willing to please, they were easy to talk to and eager to note my novice opinions on their establishment. I also met Zehra here for the first time, which was a lovely experience. I learnt from her the art of taste-testing gelato. I digress however, and will come back to that in a bit. We were told that currently the menu was completely devoted to desserts and beverages, but they are planning on expanding the menu with other items in the future. We were also told that all their ingredients are imported from Italy, and fresh berries are imported every other day from Dubai, the assortment depending on the availability. The strawberries were massive, and the blueberries tasted just as they should. Sweet and juicy little morsels, fresh as you could hope for. They had 17 choices of gelato to choose from, including sugar-free vanilla and chocolate. Let me tell you, I was stumped. I wanted to try all of them, but nightmares of what it would do to my waistline held me back. Zehra however, was my inspiration for the taste-testing method. A teaspoon of each flavor was placed around a plate, and a glass of water to cleanse the palate was provided. Then began the taste-testing. The flavors that really, really made a home in my heart have to be After Eight, Lemon Sorbet, Chocolate, Caramel, and Chocolate Orange. And here's some massively stupendous news for those of you who say no to sugar. Are you ready to hear it? The sugar-free chocolate and vanilla tasted exactly the same as the regular chocolate and vanilla. I know, right? It's crazy. You have to go try it out for yourselves.\n\nNow, as for the menu, I didn't really thoroughly study it, but I did manage to find out that the regular size for the gelato serving is 60 grams, and price is Rs. 140. Along with the gelato, everything else on the menu also seemed to be extremely reasonably priced for the quality of the desserts being served and the ambiance. Free wi-fi too! \n\nAll in all, today's visit was a pleasure, and I can't wait to visit again. Best of luck, and keep it up, team Bella Vita!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-17T19:04:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-18T11:35:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"200900469","name":"Hassan Ashfaq"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"1079332060","name":"Farheen Omer"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"508350324","name":"Fatima Sattar Chawla"},{"id":"685460614","name":"Nida Sattar-Saad"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"MjAwOTAwNDY5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"381150678602755","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Paintings*","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T19:06:52+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"381265508591272","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Another novella!!!!!

I know my reviews tend to go on like there's no tomorrow, but I like to relate my entire experience, not just the food.\nAyesha, it was wonderful to be there. Thanks so much to you and Hassan for the invitation.\nZehra, you're a sweetheart. Too, too kind. It was an absolute delight to meet you, and it wouldn't have been as much fun if you hadn't been there. Looking forward to more meeting uppings with you.\nAdnaan, you've been my virtual SWOT buddy for a while now. An actual meetup is definitely due. Small cute chick is what people mostly think of me...till I lose my temper. That title will be discussed in person. Lol.\nSaira, I got my invitation 2 days before the event. It sucks that you couldn't make it.\nMr. Joe, thank you for your gracious comments. I tend to focus more on writing and letting the readers imagination do the illustration work. When I take photographs, I'm the one who cuts off heads. I do that with such frequency that I sometimes convince myself I was a tyrant queen in another life with penchance for beheading.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-18T07:04:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"381468558570967","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"With a penchance*","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-18T07:05:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"381481378569685","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"penchance?
