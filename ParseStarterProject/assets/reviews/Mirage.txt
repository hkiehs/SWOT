Wonderful experience!!! It was Friday night and we did have a Reservation, but the place was not overly crowded. It was a peaceful environment and nice ambience. No rush. The food was good. Tried all the appetizers and they were nice. For the main course the Chinese was ok nothing too special (seriously after Chinese like ginsoy, chairman Mao, Red Emperor no other Chinese works for me) , the salads were a bit tasteless but it was the BBQ that swept me off. Yum yum awesome amazing BBQ. Namkeen boti, malai boti, bihari boti, and chicken reshmi. All were delicious to the core. Then there were some other items on the menu that were a hit, like fried fish, prawns, batair etc. The dessert were again ok-ish with the chocolate mousse and gulab jamun and ice cream being good but egg pudding being not good. So all in all it was a good experience and I'll rate it as 7/10. Will definitely be going again.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-06T23:25:56+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-06T23:25:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002971695699","name":"Syeda Tehseen Zehra Naqvi"},{"id":"100003303131853","name":"Samad Fansia"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTc1Mjc2NzUy","before":"MTAwMDAyOTcxNjk1Njk5"}}},"restaurantName":"Mirage"},{"id":"165861103465048_612801465437674","from":{"name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf","id":"715045338"},"message":"Hello Foodies! \nI have an urgent query.

Mirage is the only buffet themed restaurant at Do-Darya and is located right next to Kolachi. The ambience is nothing to write about as it?s almost the same as Kolachi, Charcoal, etc. We booked the whole upper deck unanimously for the view and later regretted the decision as the main food stations were downstairs.\nThe food stations are divided into 3 areas. The main food station is at the entrance while the BBQ section is at the upper left corner of the restaurant. The dessert and salad bar is in the top right corner.\nFor the price (Rs. 1000 per person inclusive of 1 soft drink) the food was very good. There were fresh batair?s (better than Lal-Qila?s), fried prawn tempura, Chicken Biryani, Goan Fish Curry, Chapli Kabab, pani puri are just some of the dishes that were tasted. The highlights however were the BBQ and the live chicken Karhai. The BBQ consisted of Chicken Malai Boti, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Chicken Tikka and Beef Namkeen Boti. The Malai Boti was succulent (but a little sweet for my taste) while Reshmi Kabab and Tikka were awesomely cooked (and Thank God not overcooked)  bu the Beef Namkeen Boti stole the show as it literally melted in our mouths.\nThe Karhai also has 4 varieties namely Peneer White, Peshawari Red, Green Masala and Namkeen Red Karhai. All four varieties were delicious and much better than what Kolachi serves.\nThe let down at Mirage were the salad and dessert station due to same variety as other buffets and also fried fish and the pasta dishes.\nOverall we really enjoyed our food and had a fantastic evening. Best part was that there was no hassle from the waiters or the mangers to clear the table (like they do at Kolachi & Ginsoy).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-27T18:52:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T09:29:10+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"736425186","name":"Maryam Zahoor Ansari"},{"id":"772910592","name":"Shyam Sunder"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"100000226962956","name":"Sumiaya Arif"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"711050864","name":"Abdul Raheem Khan"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"NzM2NDI1MTg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"548935991824222","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Aaquib Arif","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-27T21:28:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"549210141796807","from":{"name":"Zarfras Siddiki","id":"100003898006618"},"message":"seems they(Kolachi and Ginsoy) are quite busy in their business and they care for walk in customers,to avoid waiting in queue,,caring for customers by Kolachi and Ginsoy thats good,,","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T08:19:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549233218461166","from":{"name":"Muhammed Umer Mulla","id":"595408686"},"message":"Well yes but what if you are in thr middle of a meal and the bill is presented to you or when you try to relax the waiter constantly remind you to clear the table as they have a big cue....I mean can't they wait for say 5 mins","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T09:48:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549380488446439","from":{"name":"Sumiaya Arif","id":"100000226962956"},"message":"I second that muhammed umer mulla","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T14:42:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549876995063455","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"5-7 Mins should be max before which the Bill sould be asked for & settled.

We were at ? Mirage? last night with my whole family and it was an amazing wonderful experience. The first thing which appealed me was how the entire restaurant has been put into place, the architectural decent with classic night sea view, arrangement was quite impressive. Even though the place was packed to its full capacity, we have reservation, we were sitting at sea side view was simply mesmerizing \nSince it was our first visit at Mirage buffet dinner, we were told the every person in pretty detailed about variety of buffet food that is being offered, I found, was pretty good; for those who love traditional food stuffs there's BBQs, karhai? biryani , other desi food and for the ones who prefer Sea food, Chinese there were all sorts of desert and varieties of tasty salads available. With the arrangement of such dishes and ambience, I'd personally recommend for anyone who is going there for the very ...first time to try out their fry Parowan, fish battair and Desert (Strawberry cheese ice cream , hot fresh Gulob jaman ) are amazing.

Everything was good, yes good not poor neither exceptional. When it comes to buffet dinner the names Lal Qila, Al Boston and Village arises in your mind and if you compare them with mirage then sorry to say mirage will loose when compared to taste and especially the variety of foods. When asked from the manager that how come they don't have ice cream or at least kulfa I was replied with the answer that they are not good for the throat in winter. However the best thing about mirage is its sea view and peaceful dining experience, too bad I was accompanied with a wife and two toddlers, otherwise it would had been a great venue if I was on a date, what can be more romantic then a beautiful girl in front and the calm blue sea on the left, so I have made up my mind to go their again with my wife when my kids have grown enough to be home alone. Now according to Swots rule you are only allowed to express about the food to make sure that ones opinion does not effect the whole and I fully accept that so in the end I would only say that the gravity of food flavor greatly depends upon the environment and company you are carrying with you and I'm quite sure that many of you will enjoy their dinning experience more than I had.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-09T05:24:38+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-09T08:29:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3Mjg3Mzkz","before":"NTE3Mjg3Mzkz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"470277369690085","from":{"name":"Zubair Uddin","id":"704566421"},"message":"not good for throat....lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-09T08:29:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDcwMjc3MzY5NjkwMDg1","before":"NDcwMjc3MzY5NjkwMDg1"}}},"restaurantName":"Mirage"},{"id":"165861103465048_470067969711025","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"So i finally tried Mirage next to Kolachi, decent food reasonably priced, they do need to work on their deserts, meetha was ordinary","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-08T20:03:01+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-08T20:03:01+0000","restaurantName":"Mirage"},{"id":"165861103465048_467316459986176","from":{"name":"Asher Jamal","id":"100000712081066"},"message":"Tried Mirage last night for dinner, I loved the fact that it was buffet and an affordable one at that because Karachi doesn't have many to begin with . . .\n\nThe place looks serene, the seating arrangement is comfy and the weather is just right for such out door dinners.

The Shahi daal was a white daal and was sheer perfection, didnt try the other dishes so cant say much but given the variety there must have been something for every palate . . .\n\nThe desserts also had some diet dishes along with the regular ones and needless to say it was one fun experience. \n\nThe service needs a little upgrading though for instance the bill was served twice at my table but given the fact that it's a new venture these petty issues will be settled soon InshaAllah . . . \n\nOverall *good stuff* :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-02T07:51:08+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-02T07:51:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000226962956","name":"Sumiaya Arif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwMjI2OTYyOTU2","before":"MTAwMDAwMjI2OTYyOTU2"}}},"restaurantName":"Mirage"},{"id":"165861103465048_460008560716966","from":{"name":"Syed Hussain Mehdi","id":"717727364"},"message":"Craving for a buffet, Lalqila or Rangoli or any other?
