Dinner at Forty4 after a hiatus of more than a year, and failure to reserve space at Okra.  The place is meticulously done, with adequate lighting, formal (yet cozy) interior, and impeccable service.  \n\nThe menu is inventive, and is probably one of the better ones in the city.  More importantly, the place didn't have Moroccan Chicken, Tarragon Chicken, or any 'Chicken Steak' entree which shows that the management knows, and takes the food it serves seriously.  \n\nAnd yea, I was delighted to know that Forty4 has not jumped on the Wasabi Prawns bandwagon.  Was surprised to see tapas on the menu, which were pricier than Downtown Madrid, thereby defeating the whole spirit underlying tapas.\n\nThe menu is impressive, and demonstrates that the management has put in some serious effort in developing it.  All the prices on the menu ended with a '4', which makes mental calculation easier, and signifies management's attention to detail.  \n\nOrdered the Shrimp and Scallion Har Gow for starters, and the dumplings were delicious -- much better than that weird stuff that is served at Noodle House.  For the main course, the Beef Tenderloin was seasoned well, was succulent, and ensured that the 'meat' remained the star of the show.  Ordered it Medium-Rare, but was served Rare -- no complaints there, the rare it is, the better.  It was after a long time that I had some good ol' seasoned meat, with amazing sear marks.\n\nAbeer tried the Pasta44, and was delighted enough to exclaim \"If it wasn't for the power failure, I thought I was in Tuscany right now\".  The pasta was flavorful, and all the ingredients actually complemented each other.  Definitely one of the better pastas in the city.\n\nGot a 15% Discount on my RBS Credit Card, resulting in a per head cost of roughly PKR1300 -- which is fairly reasonable, given the quality of food served, and attentive service.  \n\nA flavorful experience.  Overall Rating -- 9/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-13T11:49:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-13T17:09:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501776623","name":"Shayan Shabbir Lakdawalla"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"787375286","name":"Zain Rauf"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"753624574","name":"Shazmeen Raza"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"683820727","name":"Aina Nasir"},{"id":"1423718906","name":"Saba Khan"},{"id":"677905296","name":"Shazia Carim"},{"id":"517470504","name":"Nida Ali"},{"id":"1510273456","name":"Daniyal Khalid"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"563320740","name":"Syed Tariq"},{"id":"524665437","name":"Saher Najam"},{"id":"635810442","name":"Kiran Afzal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjM1ODEwNDQy","before":"NTAxNzc2NjIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"633325330051954","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Excellent review.

Everything was superrb, this guy took us for a good 2 hour ride before camping out in the sea for food. The others just take you around for a bit and then start the cooking, but he made sure we enjoyed the ride. The food was as good as anyone else's Shrimp ka salan, aloo cutlets, fried fish, lollipop crabs, and also the mud crabs were all amazingly done. And the price he charged was also very reasonable. Dude took 10k for 20 people, while the others easily would have asked for 15-17k. I'm not going on anyone else's boat, ever again.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-04-06T04:34:28+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-12T09:35:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"593086875","name":"Pervin Minwalla"},{"id":"1268142470","name":"Monty Mashooqullah"},{"id":"780381887","name":"Samar Husain"},{"id":"889085130","name":"Filza Hai"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"100003048636530","name":"Sami Baba"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"1573397773","name":"Yaasmeen Abedeen"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"100000759794024","name":"Ahmed Shahnawaz"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk0MjM4NzQy","before":"MTQyMTIyMzE2NA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"351779204873236","from":{"name":"Sadaf Munir","id":"100002605916001"},"message":"Hain???

Perfect weather and time of day for a leisurely stroll up and down the broadwalk. Decided on the Aylanto Bistro, drawn by its very mod glass facade. Scanning the Menu kept outside when joined by young and intrusive waiter who insisted on giving me a running commentary, having come to the conclusion no doubt that I was faking it and looked like the type who couldn't read. Even more offensive was his casual 'hands in the pocket' manner. Anyway, ordered Shrimp Vegetable Soup-of-the-day. Excellent. Followed it up with a Classic Beef Burger. Thick juicy pattie, and all going well until encountered unchewable bits in the pattie testifying to the presence of 'charbi' in the mincemeat. Terrible! and very irritating having to spit it out. French fries scored passing grade, but the thick creamy white sauce in the burger interfered with the taste of the pattie, and kept it slipping in between the buns at crunch time. Smart, well appointed and clean toilet. But there were issues with the Menu comprising black fonts on dark blue background making for a difficult reading proposition. Black fonts on white backgrounds please. Keep it simple. Also, your printer needs a new cartridge. Could barely make out the bill. And now that you have a view of the Creek, its time to clean up the Creek. It's embarrassing, specially if you're with an overseas guest.","type":"photo","created_time":"2011-12-12T17:29:03+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-13T17:12:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"756666353","name":"Yawer Shameem"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwMjQ1MDc0MTk1","before":"NzU2NjY2MzUz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"277054605679030","from":{"name":"Tanya Azmi","id":"505248635"},"message":"Adil Ahmad, i apologize for the over enthusiastic waiter - regarding the burger - this is one of our most popular items will definitely look into the matter and have it solved.
