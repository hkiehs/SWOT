Decided upon the grilled chicken panini, and can I just say I was NOT disappointed? \nIt was absolutely scrumptious. The panini press at Sattar Buksh seems to be in perfect working order. The bread was pressed to perfection. The filling was cheesy, gooey, melted. Tender chicken strips with jalapenos and capsicum. All the flavors could be tasted, yet melded together harmoniously.

Early dinner at SattarBuksh with friends, and we were able to find space easily at 1930hrs.  Wanted to sit outside, but apparently, one requires to order Sheesha for that -- and none of us fancied smoking water.\n\nThe place suffers from an identity crisis, as it tries to make the traditional 'dhaba' feel more upscale.  The names of various items on the menu are well thought-out -- but it is really annoying to read Urdu in Roman Script.  Developing a menu purely in Urdu would have been an excellent initiative -- but I doubt majority of the patrons of the place would be comfortable with it.  The playlist of the place, was as confusing as the place itself.\n\nOrdered the 'Besharam Bun Kebab', and it was besharam, beghairat, and behooda at the same time.  It was completely bland, and as a friend remarked, \"it can serve as the perfect meal for someone who has just had Endoscopy, and needs to avoid food with spices, flavor, et al\".  Basically, a bun kebab for those who are unwell.  \n\nCan't really figure how difficult it is for SattarBuksh to prepare a decent bun kebab -- just hire the guy who stands opposite Uzma Arcade, and sell the PKR50 Anda Shami for PKR500.  Seriously, if people are willing to pay a top buck for the hospital burger -- they will be delighted to get some flavor with it as well.\n\nThe Roast Beef Burger was pretty much a disaster as well.  The meat was done well, but it was too damn salty.  All one could taste in the burger was salt, and nothing else.  Again -- these guys need to hire the guy who cooks the stuff at CHIPS and sells it for half the price.  If you're charging a top buck for a basic item, at least get the flavor right!\n\nThe Panini Sandwich was as dry as dust.  Nothing special about it.  Just a panini, and some dry chicken.  One can make a better Panini Sandwich at home at one-tenth the cost.  Again -- it had absolutely no flavor, only some chunks of chicken.\n\nI ordered an Iced Mocha, and that was the saving grace -- and it tasted perfect in that cheap IKEA glass.  The Apple Cinnamon tea also had a really nice fragrance, and was much better than other teas served in the city.  The mooch -- well, not really interested in a Movember moment.\n\nThe only good thing about the place is that it served Ben & Jerry's Strawberry Cheesecake Ice cream, which tastes awesome regardless of geographic location.\n\nA fancy place with an identity crisis, serving food straight from a hospital cafeteria.\n\nOverall Rating -- 5/10.\n\nP.S. Will go again, only for the Iced Mocha.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-03T20:59:31+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-04T16:41:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"841465178","name":"Sabika Raza"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"508081630","name":"Maha Anwar"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"593431153","name":"Rabia Aftab"},{"id":"838812489","name":"Saad Baig"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"559881298","name":"Nadia Mahasin"},{"id":"549655574","name":"Nazish Huda"},{"id":"100003573879421","name":"Samina Lotia"},{"id":"524535198","name":"Syed Sarmad Hasan"},{"id":"514440277","name":"M?ri?

I'm surprised you'd say that your bun kabab was tasteless, because my bun kabab was really flavourful and came with authentic bun kabab chutneys served on the side. The only minor complaints that we had were that the rice served with jheenga-lala were inadequate, and that the pizza could do a little better with a few more pepperoni slices.

Located in a cozy and quiet neighborhood, rubbing shoulders with Hook Line and Sinker and overlooking the tomb of ghazi shah is this epitome of creativity and a culinary experience with something slapstick about it. You are greeted by a life size moustache which is the signature object of their branding strategy. \nThe d?cor has been done tastefully. From customized furniture, crockery and silverware to creatively done walls and walkways, SB definitely looks straight out of some intense brain storming session carried out by people with some exposure to the field of advertising. The menu is designed keeping in view the basic philosophy behind a dhaaba or a modern day caf? with entrees and appetizers named using street lingo for e.g the bhinnot bun kabab, besharam burger etc. You are welcomed by a group of young and old men and women who seem to be the managing partners as well. The regular servers can be spotted taking orders and running around but the fact that the people running the show are actually at your service is something not that frequently witnessed in this part of the world. The moment you step in you are attended by one of the managing partners who makes sure you are provided a seat at the earliest. We went on a Sunday evening when the caf? was packed to capacity but after a 10 minute waiting time we did manage to grab hold of a table. We ordered their famous bhinnot bun kabab, grilled chicken pizza and a bara gosht mushroom and beef burger. The bun kabab was not bad at all. It was served quite the dhaaba style wrapped in a page torn out of a telephone directory and chutni and ketchup as the dips.  The bun kabab was filling and crisped to perfection. However it was a bit bland which could have been worked on. The beef burger was quite good. Minced beef patty with the right temperature, coupled with mushrooms, white sauce and fresh veggies sandwiched in between a crispy pair of buns and with the right amount of sauces. Their pizza was served hot with just the right quantity of cheese, chicken cubes and veggies. For drinks we had the shikanjabeen which was quite rejuvenating and had a distinct spicy touch to it. Dinner was followed by dessert for which we ordered the Philadelphia cheese cake and chocolate walnut brownie served with vanilla ice cream. One of the managing partners was quite honest about the cake and gave us a forewarning regarding the sloppiness we might experience but it was quite the contrary. The cake was soft, fresh and adequately sweet. The walnut brownie was however the dessert of the night. Together with vanilla ice cream the brownie made a nice scintillating combo. \nAll in all, Sattar Buksh was a good experience amidst all the mixed reviews we had prior the visit. Their staff was attentive and the managing partners were, warmly welcoming and hospitable. The overall theme and the philosophy behind this modern day dhaaba has been brilliantly communicated with the help of their d?cor, furniture, messaged on their tissue boxes and humorous taglines and one liners. \n\nMy personal recommendations:\nBhinnot bun kabab, Bara gosht mushroom beef burger, Grilled chicken pizza, Walnut brownie with vanilla icecream and Philadelphia cheese cake\n\nWhat seems to be their USP? \n? A friendly and hospitable team of managing partners making you feel at home. \n? Slapstick feel to the whole place. \n? Creativity at its best. \n\nWhat do they need to work on? \n? Their servers need to be well versed in communicating the contents of the food being ordered. They should know the menu inside out. \n? Accessible phone numbers for prior reservations will be really helpful.\n? The quality of food needs further improvement.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-26T06:50:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-26T08:37:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"695341673","name":"Syeda Abmreen Saira"},{"id":"761278691","name":"Abdullah Soomro"},{"id":"508947500","name":"Cyra Baria"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"851800404","name":"Aamna Mansoor Badshah"},{"id":"1203190290","name":"Tayyab Tanvir Bhatti"},{"id":"513648490","name":"Fatima Javed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEzNjQ4NDkw","before":"Njk1MzQxNjcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"624578950926592","from":{"name":"Amad Ul Hasan Siddiqui","id":"538934895"},"message":"I am not sure about Sattar Buksh but the review gets full points (Y)..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-26T08:37:31+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI0NTc4OTUwOTI2NTky","before":"NjI0NTc4OTUwOTI2NTky"}}},"restaurantName":"Sattar Buksh"},{"id":"165861103465048_624106300973857","from":{"name":"Ali Faaiz","id":"717105405"},"message":"hello,\nAs a guy who loves food I?m writing. I don't usually complain, but I think that we should mention this to the management. Maybe they can bring us some better food.  And i know it?s hard to write some negative comments. \nWith few friends & i decided to visit Sattar Buksh and finally we went yesterday night. We ordered food, Jhenga lala , Pena colada , fresh lime , hathora-mar some beef , and some other drink with sheesha (and load-shading even we just ask what is load-shading?).\nI am Very sorry to say about your management that where from you got this Idea to serve drink and then food! It is all, what your server told us \"our standard is to serve drink 1st and after that we?ll serve food\".\nFood is not like that as we were expecting........ Prawn curry was fine but rice was not, side salad was not fresh even. Beef was not with good seasoning, but Rice! I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it & serving was less than standard I must say that Quality of beef was good as very few Cafes have.\nAnd most funny thing that when we ask for bill, a guy came & ask what we had!

However we never realized that its going be this bad! Firstly, after constant requests, the waiter did not bother bringing us a menu. The waiter ended up coming after 20 minutes to take the order, and I thought that it was now time to relax! Well I was wrong to say the least, firstly, the music that was being played, gave me a headache! Nickelback playing in full volume is not something I expected to bear when I came to have a nice dinner with a relaxing cup of coffee. After at-least 45 minutes of waiting and begging for the food to arrive, my friend decided it was time to go and ask the manager what the scene was. \n\nThe reply which we got is as follows: ?You will have to be patient, it?s a full house today, there is nothing I can do? \n\nWell the food finally came, and the guy forgot one dish! Here are my reviews to each dish:\nPizza ? Extremely bland. Not well cooked or maybe lacked the ingredients. I?m no expert cook, so I don?t know the technicalities, but all I know is that it sucked and I would never want to have it again! The frozen food which I usually end up heating in the microwave for a midnight snack is better than this!\n\nThe Besharam burger -  Maybe a bad choice on my part, I don?t like burgers with sunny side up. But even after removing the egg, it tasted ?Average? ? No taste, nothing. Burger shack is a better place to have burgers not to forget MC DONALDS!\n\nBaragosht Roast burger ? Once again, extremely disappointed. The burger was meant to be roasted. NOT TOASTED! It was a pity that it tasted so awful.\nSome rice dish (can?t recall the name) ? best of the lot. Tasted far far better than other dishes and was worth the money.\n\nSheesha ? Rs. 900+ tax. I don?t care if you fill the sheesha up with real fruits instead of flavor, it doesn?t get this expensive! And on top of that, anyone who sits outside HAS to order sheesha is their policy. But I?m not going to take credit away from you guys, the sheesha was good. But not worth the money.\n\nIn the end, I would just like to tell my fellow members here. Please think twice before you goto this caf?. Just because you think it?s a nice name and closest thing we have to starbucks. It is not an excuse to go waste Rs. 1,000 +/head on bad food. \n\nMoreover, a message to Sattarbuksh owners. \nSaying that this was a soft launch doesn?t cut it. Your service sucked and so did the food. If you cannot take so many people, then consider hiding a few chairs and tell people to stand and wait till anyone leaves so that you don?t end up serving bad food. Places like Kolachi, Aylanto etc.. have huge waitings at times and are jam packed.

Well they said it for some reason surely.\n\nSattar Buksh with its catchy name and riding high on the internet media publicity and that too very creatively I have to give it to them the creativity behind SB is something out of your marketing text book. So the name is catchy it was very successful in creating the hype so how did it fare ? \n\nWell firstly the environment I would like the name of the interior designer and the architect it was so in sync with the name and the place. And they did a wonderful job and creating spaces where you don?t feel like you are all eating together with every other table in the house but rather how a caf? should be something espresso caf? and others could learn from. The flooring the walls the ceilings the artwork it isn't too much in your face yet not to subtle keeping it in line with the name. \nWell since it?s a caf? let me first talk about the chai and coffee. I think the elachi chai was amazing pretty good as good as the best chai dabas around in a comfortable environment but than again I don?t think I would be used to paying for 175 + tax for a mere cup of tea I mean you may have had it in your meetings in five star hotels but going for a casual cup of tea for 175+ is a big no no for me but heck I might go maybe but not for the tea probably for the coffee maybe because I love coffee more than my chai and they seriously did have pretty good coffee just the right temperature I had managed to try both hot and cold both were up to standard of your Gloria jeans or any other international coffee shop, priced similarly but I wouldn't go there in so much rush maybe when it dies down. \n\nHowever that is where it all goes downhill I seriously question if the idea is for  caf? or a restaurant because if they plan to make their earnings based on it being a restaurant with people occasionally ordering tea and coffee it is bound to fail they should immediately hire a new chef or something because the food is ridiculous no offence intended to anyone but the food was pathetic they don?t know how to make a pizza, a Panini in SB?s definition is a big fat loaf of bread with a bit of stuffing inside ( try butlers any given day and you will know what a Panini is ) butler is a nice example here they are not too fancy about their food but what they serve is pretty good. We were six people so I will tell the other four dishes the besharam burger again a very catchy name kudos to the guy who thought of it love the idea but the execution I have had burgers with sunny side up eggs in them but the chicken its bland no not just bland its pathetic to put it in your kitchen. Now the so called Bolognese roast burger seriously I know you guys want to be desi / angrez all at once and you have even kept the menu of bun kababs but this Bolognese burger was in the angrez section why did it taste like a bun kabab ? And not the good kind  either. Stuffed chicken penne pasta, admittedly the stuffed chicken was good but the pasta are you kidding I have made better pastas in my university days without even trying too hard. Stuffed Chicken with rice was nice because of one reason only was the chicken was the same as the pasta and that was nice. The waiter forgot our jeengalala dish which we thanked god for because after such disappointments I don?t think we could have bared another one. \n\nSheesha the only reason I mention sheesha in a separate section Is because I am big fan so I know what I am talking about well the sheeshas were nice very hygienic lots of options but 900+ tax for a sheesha I mean nowhere in Karachi have I had such an expensive sheesha. This is beyond expensive it?s a sheesha for gods sake the whole cost of making one is less than 100 rupees. Heck one whole sheesha itself costs you 3000 rupees 900+ tax for a sheesha is ridiculous Arabian or pink cadilac or for ppl of mohd ali good ol fakhir. \n\nService; well given the place was jam packed you could be forgiven for delay in service but what is unforgivable that the waiters don?t have a pen or pad to remember their orders I heard a few around me complaint about their orders and one of our dishes completely went missing when the food arrived.\n\nMy parting words I like what you are trying to do is a fusion between west and east, chai and coffee, burger and bunkabab but please change your food menu keep dishes on the light side rather than dishes with rice keep decent sandwiches nice pastas . Bring your price to a reasonable range because people might come for the hype but they need something else to come back for even those who have money to burn. But you never know Road Side caf? is still in business you might too with the same menu.As only SB can put it let me give it a try \" free advice hai leny hai tou lo warna tel lo \"","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-15T14:54:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T11:05:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"686500226","name":"Maira Uzair"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"61407780","name":"Zahrah Sehr Vayani"},{"id":"100000674735601","name":"Muhammad Patel"},{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"542900496","name":"Amal Anis Makda"},{"id":"1014345458","name":"Sadek Motiwala"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"630510285","name":"Azeem Afzal Motiwala"},{"id":"100003205271578","name":"Mahnoor Mukhtar"},{"id":"1292953231","name":"Aakash Kumar"},{"id":"597946799","name":"Alishba Shah"},{"id":"512868559","name":"Halima Sadia"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"701530707","name":"Zubia Ilyas"},{"id":"892195391","name":"Tehreem Fatima"},{"id":"647225359","name":"Sana Javeri"},{"id":"535320159","name":"Muhammad Saqib Khan"},{"id":"504319826","name":"Sarah Masood"},{"id":"1364547192","name":"Rabya Sultan"},{"id":"577409061","name":"Maaz Jamal"},{"id":"100003917951343","name":"Kiran Jabeen"},{"id":"672460650","name":"Yousuf Ali Sayeed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcyNDYwNjUw","before":"Njg2NTAwMjI2"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_619166518134502/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjcyNDYwNjUw"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619168601467627","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Omg...

The formal SWOT RATING will be done after my 3rd visit. But my first impressions will be as follows.\n\nDisclaimer:- review on three places so will be a little long, but hopefully easy to follow.\n\nCAFEELA.\nGreat concept of combining all the popular cuisines in one menu and putting in a dine-in at one the posh locations in Zamzama. Great flavours, attentive service and very easy on the wallet. A must repeat soon - my fav items - starters mein sev poori, paani poori, brain masala crispy laal atae ki naan and a glass of lassi. \n\nKHANJI\nfantastic ambiance, one of the best locations on PORT GRAND. attentive and efficient staff - also very accommodating (they actually went got us an order from another place since we had a hard core aalu-eater wi us) and great food. The items I would recommend (on just my first trip) are the mutton boti and mutton ribs (we had numkeen and I look forward to the spicy ones next time) the chicken thu well made unfortunately never scores well with me unless exceptional. The elaichee chai was just amazing and will be even more fabulous when the weather gets colder.\n\nSATTAR BUKSH\ngreat location and was access. Funky decor and an interesting place that has the potential of becoming the favourite hangout for all those looking for a place with wifi and good chai/coffee/drinks. Since they are in their infancy days (not even weeks) I will over look the few glitches. The few things that were tried today and recommended were - the bhinnote bunkebab, the daam bun kebab, the daal chawal (but didnt like the shaami kebabs) the thyme chicken, and the lassi (hmmmm yes I kinda like that over milkshake and will order it anywhere I see it on the menu) I love the little paaparde (papadoms) they served with the bun kebabs and the  best green chutney I have had outside my house. \n\nAll in all I am looking forward to SWOTTING all these places again and soon. Will rate them once I have been at least 3 times to each","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-15T19:38:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T05:49:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715251102","name":"Sophia Nazeer"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"100003247463950","name":"Murk Mustafa"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"100002814495361","name":"Studioc UpCake"},{"id":"592090015","name":"Javeria Ahmed"},{"id":"100000675092971","name":"Fahim Farooq"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"574052713","name":"Harun Aziz"},{"id":"500778016","name":"Hammad Munir"},{"id":"100003303131853","name":"Samad Fansia"},{"id":"611294921","name":"Irum Chaudhry"},{"id":"1292953231","name":"Aakash Kumar"},{"id":"709724895","name":"Annie Abbasi"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"741205131","name":"Maleeha Ahmad Qureshi"},{"id":"1324057559","name":"Safi Ahmed"},{"id":"739231013","name":"Aiya Quli"},{"id":"719028214","name":"Rehmat Ebrahim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE5MDI4MjE0","before":"NzE1MjUxMTAy"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_619277281456759/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzE5MDI4MjE0"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619278494789971","from":{"name":"Mahrukh Abbasi","id":"519901828"},"message":"i enjoyed their tea menu:  cheeni rok ke, patti thok ke, and elaichi chai :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-15T19:40:59+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619279201456567","from":{"name":"Humera Jawed","id":"644820164"},"message":"But their tea is for 175 dunt u think so it's too over price dey r not sitting in any 5 star hotel dey should cut down deir prices","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-15T19:43:28+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619281048123049","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Humera Jawed as I said there were glitches.

When I noticed the 'moustache' on the valet counter, pulled down my window to ask and was reassured that it was indeed the place. \nThe only thing that had any semblance to signage was a giant moustache on the boundary I noticed. It wasn't even lit. \n\nThe cafe had a nice courtyard outside for shisha lovers.
