We ordered beef behari boti, chicken reshmi kebab, chicken garlic mayo roll and hot & sour soup as I was craving for it. They promised to deliver within 45 minutes however it was delivered after an hour. And well, they messed up the order too. Instead of chicken reshmi kebab and beef behari boti, they delivered chicken behari boti and beef reshmi kebab. But oh boy, I am glad they messed up the order. Beef reshmi kebab were one of the best I have ever had in K-town. Beef just melted in the mouth and it was full of flavors. Chicken behari boti was juicy and full of flavors too. Both dishes were finished within 5 minutes :) Garlic mayo roll was just okay probably because it was only warm and paratha lacked the crispiness. Hot & sour soup was absolutely a no no as it tasted more like liquified ketchup having extra ordinary spices. However, the quantity of chicken in the soup was quite impressive. Overall it was a good experience with behari chicken and beef.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-17T18:43:16+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-17T20:21:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"515599528","name":"Muhammad Fahad"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"100001822097920","name":"Sara Kazmi"},{"id":"515558572","name":"Sameer Mirjat"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE1NTU4NTcy","before":"MTA3NjI4NTIxNQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"604738656243955","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"I loved the beef kababs and the imli ki chutney, and the mayo roll :-D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-17T19:18:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"604745699576584","from":{"name":"Syed Wamiq Haider","id":"514714415"},"message":"Naa...

Missed them all :-( Did go to Espresso and PITS (after hearing some girls in the line that there is something there) but i got done at 8:30 so it had ended. Treated myself to Manhattan Pizzeria and once again I was bowled away by a fantastic pizza...the Buffalo Chicken one. Would also recommend the Famous 2 deal at Red Apple the one with chicken cheese roll and chicken cheese burger. MUST try. Juicy moist yummy burger and that roll was just heaven on earth...every bite had cheese in it. And for 250 bucks it was too good to be true. Lastly, the Kaybees icecream is still great....and will take you on the nostalgic ride as the taste (along with the packaging, the perfect taste of ice cream with no after taste) is amazingly the same as it was years ago.

Decided on ordering the food from Arab Connection. Placed the order for Belly Dancer and Beefita / Chickita. On a brighter the service was excellent and the food arrived on the time they had committed. Another plus point would that the food is very very reasonably priced. \n\nThe Belly Dancer which is a replacement of sort of shawarmas was a disappointment. I thought it would have the authentic taste of Middle East as claimed on their facebook page, it was nowhere to be found. It was nothing like the shawarmas that are served in Saudi Arabia. SWOTTIES who have been for Umrah / Hajj would probably know what I am talking about as it has a very specific taste which I have yet to sample in Pakistan. \n\nThe Beefita / Chickita was at best, average. The taste was bland though it did have a decent serving. The only good thing about the meal was their dipping sauces aka the three wishes. The fries that came along were sort of a replica of the fries found at the likes of Kaybees or Red Apple. Basically they change colours in a few hours if you do not consume them. \n\nThough the place has been getting good reviews my experience was a little disappointing.
