A few lapses to be noted while giving the order. Had to repeat my order 3 times before the guy completely understood what I wanted. Secondly, no plastic money accepted, as of yet. So that was a little bummer.\nReceived my order in under 15-18 minutes. Good enough.\nWhen receiving the order, I asked whether or not there is the additional Tribeca Sauce topping that I asked (and paid) for. Apparently, they forgot that. No problem. Happens. But instead of adding that to the burger, they gave it to me as a dip.\nNow as for the burgers, yes the Tribeca Twins tasted good. But that's it. The burger tasted just....\"good\". Yes it is the only place as of yet the patty of which reminds you of Mr. Burger (which I think has THE most unique beef patty). The burger was good. Some would definitely call it brilliant. They have every right to call it so. But to me personally, it was just....lacking that \"kick\" which could make it an \"outstanding\" burger.\nAs for the Fried Chicken Fillet Burger, it was yet another experience. Hands down, THE most well-cooked piece of chicken I've had in my burger in ages. The time for which it was kept in the fryer, brilliant. Juicy, soft, moist; I can go on and on as to the quality of the chicken and the way it was cooked.\nThe fries though, for Rs. 100 were yet again just....\"okay\". Nothing exceptional about them as well.\n\nSo, would I visiting Burger Inc. again? Definitely. As I said, it's not at all bad. It's good. It's nice.\nWould I be expecting Burger Inc. to surprise me with its flavor? Sadly, no.\nBut that's just about me and my own taste buds.\n\nOnto the next experience, which was yesterday, at Del Frio. I've read posts of many different members having rough days at Del Frio, ranging from rude staff to over-cooked/burnt pizza base, but in all honesty, yesterday was my 7th or 8th visit at their SMCHS outlet and I am yet to experience a bad day with them. I've been visiting Del Frio at that outlet from the time they didn't even have the credit/debit-card machines (starting days) and my orders have ranged from pizzas to sandwiches, coffees to slushes (which they call \"XYZ ice\", depending on the flavors) and everything everytime has not just been consistent but remarkably tasty as well. Yesterday, the outlet was fairly full and I ordered my usual there, which was the Hot n Spicy pizza and the Hazelnut Cappuccino. The pizza was yum. As always. The cappuccino, though not the best I've had in K-Town (I enjoy Bella Vita's and ESPRESSO's Hazelnut Cappuccino THE most, and noone else comes close), but was just the way it always serves.\nI agree many of you have had bad times at Del Frio, but I really haven't had any such experience from them as of yet.\n\nEat on people!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-06T01:32:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-06T01:32:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001249191882","name":"Fozia Amjad"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"514392526","name":"Mahnaz Fahad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE0MzkyNTI2","before":"MTAwMDAxMjQ5MTkxODgy"}}},"restaurantName":"Bella Vita"},{"id":"165861103465048_642653269119160","from":{"name":"Nida Qasim","id":"813050144"},"message":"Guys any suggestions for a good place to go out for dessert?(other than hot spot)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-31T09:28:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-01T07:53:58+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"642815059102981","from":{"name":"Faiza Adamjee","id":"505151182"},"message":"Del Frio!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-31T13:38:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"642834512434369","from":{"name":"Hiba Arif","id":"100000749114514"},"message":"Bella vita.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-31T14:34:16+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"642876892430131","from":{"name":"Hassan Ahmed","id":"1541540918"},"message":"Butlers!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-31T15:37:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"642901169094370","from":{"name":"Nida Qasim","id":"813050144"},"message":"thnks guys","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-31T16:35:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"642991125752041","from":{"name":"Rabeet Rao","id":"749204552"},"message":"Bella Vita.

The one at Espresso is still the champion for my money but it has a lost a bit of it's flair ever since they've started to use use commercial bread instead of that overtly thick and fluffy bread they used in the initial days. I really wish they'd start to use that same bread again. But overall it's an excellent sandwich and you just cannot go wrong with it. It is also accompanied by this amazing honey, mustard dip. \n\nThe one at Bella Vita is good as well but it's no Espresso sandwich. The sandwich was a bit spicy. I do not understand why they'd spice it up but perhaps they do not want people thinking that they have copied the Espresso sandwich and want to keep their own identity. I think they can do without the \"masala zing\" in the sandwich. The potato wedgies are of gigantic proportion but they felt cold and felt overtly spiced too. But good portions overall. \n\nWinner:- Espresso Turkey Club Sanwich.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-12T16:54:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-12T16:54:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"1511554294","name":"Huma Mohiuddin"},{"id":"818928539","name":"Sabeen Malik"},{"id":"568465423","name":"Yasir Hasan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTY4NDY1NDIz","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"restaurantName":"Bella Vita"},{"id":"165861103465048_617721961612291","from":{"name":"Faisal Naseer","id":"780902784"},"message":"Hazelnut and caramel gelato at Bella Vita","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-12T14:19:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-12T14:19:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1101865045","name":"Asma Bhatti"},{"id":"539260493","name":"Faiza Omair Arab"},{"id":"1079332060","name":"Farheen Omer"},{"id":"530060365","name":"Abdul Wajid Qureshi"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"682446717","name":"Amna Tauqeer"},{"id":"505151182","name":"Faiza Adamjee"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA1MTUxMTgy","before":"MTEwMTg2NTA0NQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"picture":"http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/1229935_10152214863417785_1457200821_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10152214863417785&set\u003dgm.617721961612291&type\u003d1&relevant_count\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif","restaurantName":"Bella Vita"},{"id":"165861103465048_616672665050554","from":{"name":"Asim Khan","id":"684174898"},"message":"Any suggestions for breakfast","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-10T05:47:23+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-10T07:39:36+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"616677641716723","from":{"name":"Hadi Khan","id":"100000999733392"},"message":"Pantry","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-10T05:55:51+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100005867977339","name":"Pantry","type":"user","offset":0,"length":6}]},{"id":"616681861716301","from":{"name":"Asim Khan","id":"684174898"},"message":"thankyou, anything specific there or everything is good","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-10T06:13:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"616682345049586","from":{"name":"Hadi Khan","id":"100000999733392"},"message":"waffles!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-10T06:16:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"616693111715176","from":{"name":"Omer Jawed","id":"541276134"},"message":"Bella Vita","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-10T07:06:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"616698371714650","from":{"name":"Saad Habib","id":"641326124"},"message":"Try out Bella Vita on zamzama!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-10T07:31:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"616699741714513","from":{"name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza","id":"28117922"},"message":"N'eco's Natural Store and Cafe They have a buy one get one free on weekdays!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-10T07:39:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"109867642373012","name":"N'eco's Natural Store and Cafe","type":"page","offset":0,"length":30}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE2Njk5NzQxNzE0NTEz","before":"NjE2Njc3NjQxNzE2NzIz"}}},"restaurantName":"Bella Vita"},{"id":"165861103465048_615896305128190","from":{"name":"Rubina Habib","id":"865695264"},"message":"Went to Bella Vita today for the first time....amazing Ceaser Salad, smoked chicken Pizza, Pancakes and Yogurt gelato for dessert....everything was yum, the waiters totally switched on for any questions we had...quick delivery of food too, i am a very satisfied customer :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-08T19:27:43+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-08T19:27:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"676423132","name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala"},{"id":"100000144649501","name":"Durray Sadaf"},{"id":"541276134","name":"Omer Jawed"},{"id":"676057829","name":"Salim Rahimali"},{"id":"1079332060","name":"Farheen Omer"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA3OTMzMjA2MA\u003d\u003d","before":"Njc2NDIzMTMy"}}},"restaurantName":"Bella Vita"},{"id":"165861103465048_614497295268091","from":{"name":"Tabish R.

I entered with 3 people (that's 4 including me) - and one more was to join us later. This was around 10:15 p.m. or so. The place was fully packed - as it usually is. Since we had had had our dinner, we just needed to get some dessert and then head back home. The two tables to the left were vacated about 10-15 minutes after we had entered. As soon as they were vacated, 3 women came in and stood at the counter. One of them smiled at the baby I was holding. Since we had been waiting long enough and there was no one else waiting before us, I took a few steps in the waiters direction and asked him if he could put the two vacated tables together so that we could sit. He informed me that the tables, even when put together, can accommodate 4 people only (we had requested for a seat for 5) but since there was no other option, we can sit there if we want. We did. The next time - almost 2 minutes later - when the waiter crossed us - we asked him if/ when the couch corner would be vacated, he would accommodate us with the addition joining us soon - of which he already knew since we had requested for a table of five. He informed us that the 3 ladies who had entered wanted it. Our 5th participant entered and when he saw the lack of space, requested the same to the waiter, and was informed the same. He went over to the three ladies and explained the dilemma to them. Needless to say, we were shocked at their rude behaviour. 'Humaray sath kia hay ab bugto' attitude threw us all off guard since we did not know we had done anything wrong. Bella Vita has been a frequent haunt for the past year - for its pizzas as well as its desserts. Often people who have entered after us have seated themselves in the couch corners or elsewhere before us and we've always smiled and let go. Whats another 10 minutes we figured. What was more shocking however was what ensued. We went to the waiter and asked him why he had not informed us if the table he had placed us at was someone elses; to which, horror of all horrors, he says: jaldi thee na bethnay ki, ab bugto:) errr....Im lost. The manager apologized but we left after paying. We did not bother finishing our dessert. Our apologies to the three ladies whose table we had unknowingly taken. It would be nice if the waiters would be trained to deal with rush hours and tackle tricky situations. Had the waiter informed us that he had already committed the small table to someone else, we would not have had any problems. The scene that ensued was unneeded and left a very bad taste in our mouths.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-02T14:39:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-03T05:23:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"763705199","name":"Natasha Matin"},{"id":"1270161344","name":"Rabia Annus"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"531090703","name":"Kiran Khawar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTMxMDkwNzAz","before":"NzYzNzA1MTk5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"613116428739511","from":{"name":"Kiran Khawar","id":"531090703"},"message":"Tsk tsk tsk what a shame... though i must admit their ice creams are good... waise i ? movenpick so incase u want to take some old friends out for icecream, id recommend u go there ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-02T15:05:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"613124858738668","from":{"name":"Uzma B","id":"511882940"},"message":"Da waiter has no right to talk to da customer in dat way!!

Nothing too fancy, yet nothing to casual, either. Ended up at the recently opened Cilantro, a hop, skip and a jump away from Pane and Amore (Love). Although I was a bit skeptical about trying out a new place, and that too because my dad read a review in this Sunday's DAWN (I was like, Abu, really? You want to try out a new place because of a newspaper ka review? Kisi se puch toh lein!). Khair, my Abu being my Abu, insisted we go there, so with some trepidation, I did. Little did I know, that I was entering a fun, colorful little joint with one wall filled with chefs from all over the world. Is it weird I knew half of them? And if the owners of Cilantro read this, please add Marco Pierre White's picture to the wall. Blasphemous he's not there. Thank you. On to the food. It's very rare when every single person likes and enjoys what they ordered. Now, if you know me, you know I tend to never, ever remember the proper names of things eaten. So please excuse that lapse of mine. Before we got our order, we got a complimentary pizza toast type thing, which at first glance seemed dubious regarding the taste, and I was afraid the toppings would make the toast itself soggy. We were pleasantly surprised to find it was quite delicious! The flavors of the tomato base, onions and green pepper on the crispy toasted bread coated with mozzarella was a beautiful combination. I ordered the calamari and prawn soup, which is not for those who like mild, flavorful soups. This was hot, like hot and sour soup hot, and as expected, frozen seafood tends to have that halkiii si smell. I must say though, that the prawn and calamari weren't too rubbery or overcooked (Y). Next up, as appetizers, we ordered Lunch on a Stick. While it may sound interesting, to say the least, it was deeelllliiicccious! Kind of like a desified version of a corn dog, with fries covered in garlic mayo, which was again, very good. Just the right kick off garlic and a hint of sour. Lunch on a Stick was served in a fry basket, and me being easy to entertain, found the curls of carrots on top really cute, and yummy to eat. The batter-fried chicken that comprised of our appetizer had a salsa verde type filling, and the batter itself wasn't bad at all. It wasn't the tempura batter at Sakura by any stretch, mind you, but had some crunch to it. I wouldn't mind having that as a midnight snack, to tell you the truth. My sister ordered the Caesar salad, which she enjoyed as well. I asked for the grilled chicken and mushroom spaghetti, which while it lacked salt, was beautifully done. Tender pieces of chicken flavored with tarragon, and a hint of spice to cut the richness of the white cream sauce. Once again, I had my entertaining carrot curls, which might bother some, but since I like my veggies, I ate them right along with my meal. My sister ordered a club sandwich, which she and Abu shared, and it looked mighty fine. Even Abu, fussy as he is about his club sandwiches, enjoyed it immensely. My brother in-law ordered a steak, the Americano, I believe, and since he wasn't talking while eating, I'm guessing he really liked it. Oh, and did I mention it was pink in the middle? The steak, not my brother in-law. From my limited knowledge, I could tell the steak had been grilled to perfection. My mother ordered the Hannah or Hannan chicken, not too sure, and she told me the sauce was jalapeno flavored, and she really liked her dinner too. I also asked for the mint lemonade, which was a refreshing change, since most places usually use 7 Up as the basis of their lemonade, this was closer to home, made in water and strong on the mint, which is how I love it. The service was bit slow, however. But I was expecting that since it's a relatively new place and as all businesses, will settle with time. Now, considering that two people from the six of us hadn't ordered any entree, the bill was phir bhi much, much lower than expected, and with the quality of the food, ambiance, and servings, unbelievably reasonable. After that, we couldn't resist Pane and Amore's cupcakes, could we? If we hadn't been so stuffed, I would have insisted we sit there and have a cup of coffee and share cupcakes. That still didn't stop me from taking a bite (Or 2) out of my peanut butter cupcake, which was just...I mean...I have no words. And I have more cupcake for me tomorrow! Yay!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-09T19:22:33+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-10T15:59:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"684094046","name":"Faiza Hasan"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Spaghetti marinara\n3. Pizza ala Pollo\n4. Baked buffalo wings\n5. Potato skins\n\nDoesnt sound much, right? Oooooooffffff it was massive and except for pasta: all delectable.\n\nBuffalo wings were brilliantly crispy and good flavoured sauce. The tomato oregano salsa accompanying it: slurp.\n\nPotato skins: massive load of flavour. Large potato skins filled with chunks of baked chicken, jalapenos, olives and topped with cheese. A meal unto themself.\n\nNachos: can serve 3 people alone!!!! Served as doritos topped with corn jalapenos and tomatoes amongst other things: oh dear. Erm. Not super great or very remarkable but a flavourful meal.\n\nPizza: i love it. Presence of basil and their tomato paste are  their biggest highlight, in addition to delightful thin crust. \n\nSpaghetti marinara: lacked flavour of olive oil or garlic or oregano. As a result the tomatoes tasted curried.\n\nAdding the tomato sauce served with buffalo wings did bring out flavour.\n\nOverall.

The idea is wonderful but i wonder why all the plants and trees were very average type. Nothing extra ordinary, nothing exotic, nothing really to talk about. Yes it was very green but gave a jungle feel. Untrimmed trees, no music. \nMenu: 1/10\nWho puts Fries on the list of appetizers? Under Pasta there were only 2. \"Alfredo\" and \"Arabiata\". We were really lost as in what type of pasta, and proteins and/or veggies it came with since there was no description or anything. Staff is very new, no one really knew what was in it either. The server ran twice in the kitchen to ask. Expected a little more than just a very average, limited menu. \nFood: 3/10\nOrdered Chicken with almond and strawberry sauce, Fish and boneless buffalo wings between 2 people. Food was all a bit cold-ish. The sauce on the chicken was good, sweet and nutty in flavor with the essence of rosemary, came with saut?ed veggies. However the chicken to very thinly cut, breaded and fried. I was looking forward to a whole breast piece, a good juicy meaty chicken. It was really thin sliced and dry. The fish was a bit better, after the first bite, found hair so really cannot comment. The wings were on the same lines as the chicken, just thinner with a buffalo sauce dip. Again, very disappointing..\nService: 4/10\nGiven it is a new restaurant, but the manager had no knowledge about the menu. He said the chicken came with 'chips'. When the entree arrived we inquired about the 'chips' and he brought us a plate of fries. We let him know about the hair in the Fish, the chef said it probably flew in since we were sitting outside. It was taken off the bill but no apologies and/or suggestions if we wanted something different instead. The bill (a handwritten on a memo pad) came with GST tagged on, without the SNTN# mentioned on it. We asked for the server to mention it, he came back with the SNTN number again handwritten.

The idea is wonderful but i wonder why all the plants and trees were very average type. Nothing extra ordinary, nothing exotic, nothing really to talk about. Yes it was very green but gave a jungle feel. Untrimmed trees, no music. \nMenu: 1/10\nWho puts Fries on the list of appetizers? Under Pasta there were only 2. \"Alfredo\" and \"Arabiata\". We were really lost as in what type of pasta, and proteins and/or veggies it came with since there was no description or anything. Staff is very new, no one really knew what was in it either. The server ran twice in the kitchen to ask. Expected a little more than just a very average, limited menu. \nFood: 3/10\nOrdered Chicken with almond and strawberry sauce, Fish and boneless buffalo wings between 2 people. Food was all a bit cold-ish. The sauce on the chicken was good, sweet and nutty in flavor with the essence of rosemary, came with saut?ed veggies. However the chicken to very thinly cut, breaded and fried. I was looking forward to a whole breast piece, a good juicy meaty chicken. It was really thin sliced and dry. The fish was a bit better, after the first bite, found hair so really cannot comment. The wings were on the same lines as the chicken, just thinner with a buffalo sauce dip. Again, very disappointing..\nService: 4/10\nGiven it is a new restaurant, but the manager had no knowledge about the menu. He said the chicken came with 'chips'. When the entree arrived we inquired about the 'chips' and he brought us a plate of fries. We let him know about the hair in the Fish, the chef said it probably flew in since we were sitting outside. It was taken off the bill but no apologies and/or suggestions if we wanted something different instead. The bill (a handwritten on a memo pad) came with GST tagged on, without the SNTN# mentioned on it. We asked for the server to mention it, he came back with the SNTN number again handwritten. We paid Rs. 1400 plus change (the fish was taken off the bill) and then we went to Bella Vita for Dinner :)\n\nAll in all, prices vs. quantity wasn't justified. \nMenu vs. Food quality was again disappointing.

However, the one problem i noticed all three times was that the food kept finishing and wasnt refilled at the right time. Seemed ok in the first week of Ramzan but shuoldve fixed the problem by the last. Oh well.\n- Kolachi - Great food, but tooooooo crowded. Wouldnt bother going for iftar again. Definitely would try it on another day for food.\n- Cafe Blue Ginger - Good food. Rubbish service.\n- Deli - Excellent menu selection and food was really tasty.

To begin with, the space was intelligently designed. Homely, welcoming and very cheerful. The perfect setting for casual, comfortable dining. Nothing over the top or garish, just right for the type of food being served. \n\nThe pizzas were highly recommended and now I understand why. \n\nWe tried the Pizza Diavola, which was their take on the classic Pepperoni, however unlike regular Pepperoni pizzas that rely entirely on the pepperoni and side step other ingredients, this pizza was full of flavor. You could tell immediately that this was going to be a superior quality pizza just by the aroma. Parmesan,mozzarella, basil and tomatoe, complimenting each other and coming together in perfect unison. 'The crust', now pay attention, the crust was perfection. Thin, crispy and uniform right from the centre to the edges, something that is missing in many of the pizzas offered at other places. \n\nThe Pizza al Pollo, was a chicken pizza, not my favorite, as I am against chicken on pizza. However I must appreciate that it had a flavor and texture of its own. What I have observed in other pizzerias is that although they offer a wide variety of pizzas, surprisingly they all have such a similar taste. This is largely due to the over bearing flavor of the sauce, many a time one is left to wonder and guess which pizza is which.  \n\nWe ordered the New York cheese cake and Copa Romana for dessert. I will refrain from writing about the cheese cake because, to put it politely I would like to forget it. I'm glad I ordered the Copa Romana as a back up. It was a delight from start to end. Rich in both flavor and texture. Be warned, you do not want to take this one down on your own. \n\nOver all, Bella Vita is a place that can easily become one of my favorites. Most definitely a must try if you prefer gourmet style pizzas.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-03T19:22:49+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-04T11:23:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"511301771","name":"Eefa Khalid"},{"id":"641326124","name":"Saad Habib"},{"id":"642953122","name":"Amer Zahid"},{"id":"200900469","name":"Hassan Ashfaq"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"541276134","name":"Omer Jawed"},{"id":"685460614","name":"Nida Sattar-Saad"},{"id":"1079332060","name":"Farheen Omer"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA3OTMzMjA2MA\u003d\u003d","before":"NTExMzAxNzcx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"420302334687589","from":{"name":"Cyra Anklesaria","id":"557321236"},"message":"WHATS A COPA ROMANA ???","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-03T19:26:19+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"420303148020841","from":{"name":"Omar Omari","id":"508277151"},"message":"Go try it..' and the truth shall set you free'","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-03T19:28:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"420303511354138","from":{"name":"Cyra Anklesaria","id":"557321236"},"message":"he hee :) \nme becoming moti -\nno more deeeeeeesseerrttsss :(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-03T19:29:20+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"420303641354125","from":{"name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed","id":"516567649"},"message":"Xcuse me ... since when? thankless much :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-03T19:29:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"420304511354038","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Omar Omari:- What about the New York cheese cake?

Wanted to order the mid-night special deal for 4 (which has 2 pizzas) - but they had only 1 pizza left to serve at like 0200PST.  No point of a midnight/sehri type deal when they're running out of food early - and it wasn't like the place was full or anything.  And yea, they ran out of mineral water bottles as well.\n\nOrdered Pizza de pollo (or something on similar lines), Roast Beef Sandwich, Turkey Sandwich, and Nachos - the roast beef sandwich was the worst I've ever eaten, CHIPS serves a way better sandwich at a third of price.  The Turkey Sandwich & Nachos were decent.  There was nothing special about the pizza as well (it was good, but nothing out of this world) - much better pizzas are available at better prices, so that was a disappointment too.  And the mint lemonade was just depressing.  On the flipside, the Strawberry Cheesecake Gelato was excellent - but TUC's a more reasonable option on the gelato front.\n\nAnd the pizza is just depressingly small for the price.\n\nAs a friend remarked, 'dil bhar gaya, magar pait nahi bhara'.

Enjoy!\n\nToday was my first time attending a blogger's meet at the soon-to-open Bella Vita. So exciting! Located right next to the Pizza Hut lane at Zamzama, this outlet is difficult to miss with its massive awning. Even with my lack of direction sense, I managed to make it without any difficulty at all. Upon entering, I had to silently admit to myself that this was one prettily dressed up place. It gave a very warm, welcoming vibe, where you can just imagine sitting yourself at a corner table in the comfy chair large enough to fit two people (At least for me) for as long as you wish to, with a cup of your favorite coffee and a good book. There was wooden paneling, tasteful painting interspersed along the walls, and amidst all the masculine brown paneling, femininely attired chandeliers hung at various intervals from the wooden ceiling. There was enough seating to accommodate a party of six or a table for two, interspersed with an assortment of comfortable looking lounging-type chairs, and the regular wooden chairs. \n\nUpon meeting the owners, I could see that the welcoming and comfortable atmosphere of Bella Vita was a reflection of their personalities. More than willing to please, they were easy to talk to and eager to note my novice opinions on their establishment. I also met Zehra here for the first time, which was a lovely experience. I learnt from her the art of taste-testing gelato. I digress however, and will come back to that in a bit. We were told that currently the menu was completely devoted to desserts and beverages, but they are planning on expanding the menu with other items in the future. We were also told that all their ingredients are imported from Italy, and fresh berries are imported every other day from Dubai, the assortment depending on the availability. The strawberries were massive, and the blueberries tasted just as they should. Sweet and juicy little morsels, fresh as you could hope for. They had 17 choices of gelato to choose from, including sugar-free vanilla and chocolate. Let me tell you, I was stumped. I wanted to try all of them, but nightmares of what it would do to my waistline held me back. Zehra however, was my inspiration for the taste-testing method. A teaspoon of each flavor was placed around a plate, and a glass of water to cleanse the palate was provided. Then began the taste-testing. The flavors that really, really made a home in my heart have to be After Eight, Lemon Sorbet, Chocolate, Caramel, and Chocolate Orange. And here's some massively stupendous news for those of you who say no to sugar. Are you ready to hear it? The sugar-free chocolate and vanilla tasted exactly the same as the regular chocolate and vanilla. I know, right? It's crazy. You have to go try it out for yourselves.\n\nNow, as for the menu, I didn't really thoroughly study it, but I did manage to find out that the regular size for the gelato serving is 60 grams, and price is Rs. 140. Along with the gelato, everything else on the menu also seemed to be extremely reasonably priced for the quality of the desserts being served and the ambiance. Free wi-fi too! \n\nAll in all, today's visit was a pleasure, and I can't wait to visit again. Best of luck, and keep it up, team Bella Vita!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-17T19:04:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-18T11:35:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"200900469","name":"Hassan Ashfaq"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"1079332060","name":"Farheen Omer"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"508350324","name":"Fatima Sattar Chawla"},{"id":"685460614","name":"Nida Sattar-Saad"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"MjAwOTAwNDY5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"381150678602755","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Paintings*","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T19:06:52+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"381265508591272","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Another novella!!!!!

The place is STUNNING!! From the walls (faux leather panels wid embroidery detailing) to the lights, to the sofas (again with the embroidered detailing) to the decor.... Extremely soothing is the ambiance. They have a deserts, drinks and coffee menu only at the moment but boy-o-boy does it rock! Their regular serving of gelato is 60 grams roughly for Rs 140, large is 120 grams for  Rs 250. They also offer Xlarge, 1/2 liter and liter potions. And their premiums (sugar free etc) start at Rs 165 for 60 grams. They have an amazing assortment of toppings tat vary from sauces, Rochers, shortbread biscuits etc. Their deserts start at an amazing price of Rs 250 onwards which is VERY reasonable in today's market. tried all their ice creams and can say without a doubth.....all other gelatories better start bracing themselves. Not only does this place look Individual with it's identity, it's products stand out as well!
