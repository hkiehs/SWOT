As I walked in, loved the outdoor ambiance, as well as indoor. \nI ordered some chicken with turkey bacon which was delicious. The chicken was cooked to perfection (soft and tender), perfect seasoning that was not killing the taste of chicken, turkey bacon or cheese. Loved the saut?d veggies and baked potato slices with cheese. Tried grilled with Jalapeno sauce, which was tasty too. Ordered Peach Iced tea, which I didn't like. Iced tea is not everyone's cup of tea. Lemon Iced tea was too sweet, but we asked the waiter to make it less sweet, on which he was very sweet and took it away to change it. Later he told us that the sugar syrup was not mixed properly.\nOrdered Creme Brulee, profiteroles, Chocolate Fondant for dessert. Creme Brulee was creamy and not too sweet (which I liked according to my taste). I am not a big sweet fan. Some on the table didn't like, but it was something I would like as a dessert, which is not so sweet compared to Profiteroles and Chocolate fondant I tasted. Chocolate fondant was divine!\nAll in all, loved the experience and the food at Cafe Flo. Food and ambiance didn't disappoint me according to my taste.

Ordered djonnaise steak, I was told it will be local tenderloin but I guess it was fillet mignon since the width was about 1.5 inch but the size was really small making it a total of 200 something grams. I ordered medium well but it looked pretty much medium, I requested them for it to be cooked more since and they changed it without any hesitation. 9/10. BUT it still does not beat the steak I ate in dxb, not even close and not that big as well.\n\nDidn't order the choc lava cake which was another reason to go there cuz I saw the dish being served on another table and it looked too tiny with vanilla icecream. \nOverall a good experience but too expensive for the quantity (2800 for 3 dishes of which 2 are starters). 10% service charge was applied but since it wasn't written anywhere I asked the manager to deduct it which he did, saving me 200+ rupees.

I didn't think the food was worth the bill I got to be fair- I have paid the same amount at Cafe Flo for their awesome lunch deals where I have eaten a 2 course and 3 course meal WITH drinks!\n\nTo top it off, the restaurant was empty all through lunch, surprisingly, and the staff was the least bit interested. People from the kitchen (its a glass kitchen so they can see us, we can see them!) eventually had to get out and fetch the staff for us after a whole while of waiting! Rather disappointed overall, even though I was happy with my chicken!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-19T15:16:20+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-19T15:16:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"684575822","name":"Imran A Razak"},{"id":"100001703278373","name":"Kanzah Mahar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNzAzMjc4Mzcz","before":"Njg0NTc1ODIy"}}},"restaurantName":"Cafe Flo"},{"id":"165861103465048_528978767153278","from":{"name":"Urbanite Pk","id":"100003613396124"},"message":"From Florence, With Love \r\n\r\nOrder in from our latest addition - Cafe Flo","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-03-28T14:13:07+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-28T14:13:07+0000","picture":"http://photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/549794_293422680788176_903790451_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d293422680788176&set\u003dgm.528978767153278&type\u003d1&relevant_count\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif","restaurantName":"Cafe Flo"},{"id":"165861103465048_514226001961888","from":{"name":"Anam Asif","id":"507367484"},"message":"Went to Cafe Flo last Friday for lunch and I probably haven't had a better experience, ever.

However, I have been to Forty4 several times in small and large groups and at various times of the week / lunch / dinner. One of the most consistently noticeable comments from my friends has been to acknowledge the service in addition to the food quality, selection and value. That said, I am sure that there have been issues as Aman Virji has acknowledged. For the record, I would not hesitate to take groups of friends or professional colleagues to Forty4! One restaurant that remains unmentioned is Pompeii which should be in the running as they do meet all the same standards that Forty4 has for our dining experiences. Have not been to Thyme or The Patio so I cannot comment, although others have said good things about both places ... especially The Patio. Aylanto has disappointed us multiple times with respect to food and at our last visit, we actually left without eating due to issues with the attitude of the staff. For that reason, we have not been to Aylanto for many months now and therefore things could be very different by now so it is hard for me to offer anything more than our prior experiences while acknowledging the passage of time. Okra is not a place we have visited very often but many of our friends go there and I have never heard anything but glowing reports about the food with the only cautionary factors being the small size of the restaurant and sometimes the availability of reservations. Cafe Flo has its diehard fans or people like me who feel that it is nice enough but not among our first choices.

Our waiter (Javad) is something truly exceptional.  He remembers our names, our favourite dishes, and has yet to tell us \"No\" for any request. \n\nB - They cook probably the finest steaks around town.  Whether you order the medallion, the tenderloin, or the rack of lamb (cheating this isn't a steak); they UNDERSTAND their meat.  Do you want medium rare? They'll give you medium rare.  This is an international standard being upheld.  \n\nC- There has never been an issue with quality.  The standards have always EXCEEDED my expectations. The layout is gorgeous, the temperature is always just right, and they go out of their way to take care of you if come in sick. \n\nD- Pricing is fantastic.  Cafe Flo', Dynasty, and Saffron charge an extra 10% on top of the 16% GST.  This brings the total to a hilarious 26% plus tip.  I've began to notice others following this trend.  Olivetto not only looks the part, but the prices are competitive when competing against the dinosaurs of Karachi Lifestyle dining.\n\nI just want to tip my hat to Afroza Bhamani and Afroze Khan. You have created something truly special.  Please wait for my full review. \n\nI thank you for your time.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-05T07:34:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-05T07:34:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"586043191","name":"Mustafa Mohomedally"},{"id":"100000093496883","name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"1137915284","name":"Mohammad Bin Zia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzNzkxNTI4NA\u003d\u003d","before":"NTA0MDkzOTk3"}}},"restaurantName":"Cafe Flo"},{"id":"165861103465048_309011995816624","from":{"name":"Naheed Ghulamhussain","id":"718233292"},"message":"in winters,outdoor dinning is the best at Cafe Flo.i wish the same held true fr the food :(:(","type":"status","created_time":"2012-02-02T13:06:54+0000","updated_time":"2012-02-02T18:18:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"686712045","name":"Irfan Aslam"},{"id":"507619173","name":"Sadaf Rehman"},{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"573859815","name":"Nighat Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTczODU5ODE1","before":"MTA1MzgyODYyNw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"309014865816337","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"oh please dont - FLO is and always remain  a fav - how bad was the food experience","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-02T13:13:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"309016192482871","from":{"name":"Nighat Khan","id":"573859815"},"message":"I think Flo is bit over rated, but thats my experience at Flo","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-02T13:16:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"309018619149295","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Nighat Khan - hey you welcome back long time no comment.\n\nFLO is no longer just a cafe or an eatery - its an establishment - with a collection of memories. some brilliant evenings spent there with people who may have gone but their imprints on my life will be there for ever (my father)\n\nalso its first of its kind for our generation to have brought true fine dining to Karachi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-02T13:21:33+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"573859815","name":"Nighat Khan","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"309022955815528","from":{"name":"Nighat Khan","id":"573859815"},"message":"Flo is really liked was the one at AF","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-02T13:30:49+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"309023449148812","from":{"name":"Nighat Khan","id":"573859815"},"message":"Food is very personal thing, one man's medicine may be other man;s poison","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-02T13:31:37+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"309062405811583","from":{"name":"Naheed Ghulamhussain","id":"718233292"},"message":"Nez,i like the food at Okra n Olivetto better","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-02T14:33:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"309076552476835","from":{"name":"Sadaf Rehman","id":"507619173"},"message":"so true! outside ambiance is fantastic, food is so-so","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-02T14:56:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"309092662475224","from":{"name":"Nada Navid","id":"1621356970"},"message":"i too prefer the food at okra...always went to flo especially for their cheese souffle but ever since it's taken off the menu i prefer okra","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-02T15:21:48+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"309096889141468","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"I was there last week and the food was not too bad.

The other option would be for us to reduce the prices by not using the best ingredients available in the market, something which we are not prepared to do. As an example, the beef burger or the roast beef sandwich is the same cut and quality used for our steaks at Cafe Flo. We hope that you visit us and judge for yourself and of course any comments that you may post after would be given attention. Sabah Rahman glad that you like the crab ravioli. The reason the crab ravioli is not as much as you expect is because crabs are one of the most difficult ingredients to clean, prepare and we have someone dedicated just for that. We can increase it but the price would have to as well, which would make us a full fledged restaurant instead of a trendy, gourmet cafe that we hope and wish to be. Nevertheless  all comments are appreciated and connstrucive criticism is the only thing that can help us improve at our weak points.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-11-30T16:51:20+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi","type":"user","offset":3,"length":10},{"id":"530610724","name":"Sabah Rahman","type":"user","offset":704,"length":12}]},{"id":"269265146457976","from":{"name":"Bilal Alvi","id":"641495625"},"message":"Alexandre Rizvi, i love your approach, and now, solely due to this very courteous post, I shall visit your caf? very soon and try out the food that I have heard so much about.
