It was a successful event and we had a great time meeting new people :)  \n\nFirstly last night was one of the coldest nights by far and I thought we were going to turn into popsicles but thanks to the  management at Sajjad that didn't happen. It was unusually and surprisingly warm. Its covered from all sides and has fires burning at different spots which is really nice. So this answers the question for all who have been seeking a warm spot at do darya.\n\nNow to the FOOD.\nStarters: Chicken Dhakka, Hot and Sour Soup, BBQ prawns, lemon chicken and fish dhakka.\n\nMains: Afghani Boti, Chicken karhai, Shahi Handi.\n\nSTARTERS:\n? Chicken Dhakka: \n The most loved starter off all time I assume. It had been wiped clean off the dish as soon as it hit the table. Boneless chicken fried in a delicious batter served with this amazing sauce. Hands down the best dish on the menu and a must must try.\n\n?Hot & Sour Soup:\nDefiantly has room for improvement. But since we were sitting in a Pakistani themed Resturant i didn't expect a tiny Chinese man dancing out of my soup. So all good.\n\n?BBQ Prawns: \nOk i am not a seafood person at all. So according to the people who ate them they did enjoy. Its a very interesting dish. Plain simple flavours which enhanced the taste of the prawns \n\n?Lemon Chicken:\nAnother of my favorites. YUM i felt like im in chicken heaven. Crunchy chicken fried perfectly packed with that lemon zing. At the same time it didnt over power the chicken.\nI would keep going back for that.\n\n?Fish Dhaka:\nAnother one of the yummi delights. Me not being a sea food person fell for them like i slipped on a banana peel. \nMust try again. A complete winter dish\n\nMAINS:\nWe had stuffed our selfs with the starters lol\n\n?Chicken Karhai:\nJust has a taste but now i know why are they famous for it. Tasted yum.\n\n?Afghani Beef Boti:\nI can keep returning for that every single day. Soft, filled with taste, melts in the mouth. Neither to spicy neither bland just the right amount of spices.\n\n?Shahi Chicken Handi:\nA shahi handi for a shahi gathering lol. \nI love it. Boneless chicken chunks cooked in butter and topped with cheese and hints of fresh herbs. It has that yummy creamy subtle taste. Geez my mouth still waters for it. Total justice to the dish.\n\nOverall: \nGreat service.\nFood arrived hot and on time.\nAttentive staff.\nLoved the plastic covers against the wind. \n\nSpecial thankyou to all the foodies that showed up. \nHope to see u all soon.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-29T14:35:00+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-02T21:31:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"541880374","name":"Noreen Ahmed"},{"id":"100001434743152","name":"Raza Rehmani"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"100003570224157","name":"Kashif Khan"},{"id":"100001356574653","name":"Rude Plannet Kennel Rpk"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"532470690","name":"Sana Zaeem"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"887535136","name":"Jabbar Abdul"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"796000540","name":"Nisa Abdul Basit Khan"},{"id":"100001217752738","name":"MehRose Khan"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"729875068","name":"Soomro Ali"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"733018407","name":"Nabeel Kazi"},{"id":"100002943458913","name":"Aisha Wali Muhammad"},{"id":"1356485615","name":"Samrah Owais"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5MjA0NTUy","before":"MTAwMDA1NDIxODIzNTg4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_674208709296949/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzQ5MjA0NTUy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"674210079296812","from":{"name":"Zohaib Ali Memon","id":"524501080"},"message":"need to make it to one of these some day","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:38:13+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213699296450","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"So who all came?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:10+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213745963112","from":{"name":"Khozema Soni","id":"513558813"},"message":"If this event took place why was that girl siting alone ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:18+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674216695962817","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Khozema Soni well there was a bit of miscommunication.

Did not even bother checking them this time. I love my food but waiting an hour plus for being seated is a buzzkill for me, heck it's even longer then it takes me to eat sometimes. Hence Kolachi was a BIG NO... *sigh*\n\nEnded up going to Al Sajjad as it's become quite a favorite of mine during the last couple of months.\nTook hardly around 5 mins to be seated (im very picky about seating). Must say I love it better then the others, it's not too crowded (means lesser people staring at us eating while they wait :p) and iv always gotten amazing service and taste with next to no time wastage ..\n\nNow Food...\nOrdered Fish Dhaka and Chicken Dhaka, Lemon Chicken, Malai Boti, and Chicken Karhai..\nBoth Fish and Dhaka Chicken tasted amazing as ever. Crunchy on the outside and soft inside. The quantity was very generous plus the taste which made it impossible to keep my hand away hence I was quite full to attack the others.\n\nLemon chicken was creamy with a hint of lime.\n\nDid not have the stomach to try the malai boti and karhai but the family loved it, so il take their word for it. \n\nOne extra point for how carefully they pack the left over food upon request. Proper tiny boxes, was warm even when I opened it at home. \n\nYet again they have managed to make me very happy. Great food and even better service. *Double Thumbs Up*\n\nOne little advice though, I would appreciate a better choice of music in the background.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-16T19:29:28+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T09:50:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"524835210","name":"Ali Dayo"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"1385831564","name":"Mehvish Ayaz"},{"id":"100002698452985","name":"Rabia Mahmood"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"511130593","name":"Layla Rizvi"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"620585988","name":"Midhat Mirza"},{"id":"1053980754","name":"Wajeeha Amir"},{"id":"512612823","name":"Leena Faruqui"},{"id":"100000533457073","name":"Tooba Saleem Rindani"},{"id":"687185098","name":"Syed Fawad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg3MTg1MDk4","before":"MTAwMDAyNTQ4OTcxNjE3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619768214740999","from":{"name":"Syed Fawad","id":"687185098"},"message":"Yes  true I think in nearby future this strip of rest at Do darya might shutdown  down soon & I luv the view from each rest kolachi , ambalA , al sajad &many more I luv the food there , view is amazing value if money is also good","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T19:45:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619768324740988","from":{"name":"Syed Fawad","id":"687185098"},"message":"Value of money *","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T19:45:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619774244740396","from":{"name":"Zahid Ali Shahid","id":"2531013"},"message":"Ur like obsessed with Sajjad, lol.
