Ordered the spicy chicken wings, smoked turkey sandwich and chicken and brie pizza. Absolutely LOVED the spicy chicken wings. Tangy, hot and perfectly spiced?I?ll be ordering these every time I go there! The smoked turkey sandwich was ok.. just a little on the dry side. The pizza..aahhh they know how to do their thin crust pizza! It was cheesily fantastic! Thoroughly enjoyed everything! And I think we have all read enough about the froyo here. It tastes even better than the way people describe it on this page! I?m really happy to see that this place has maintained its superior quality over the past months..I?ve always left this place as a happy and satisfied customer :)\n\nAlso, I went to roasters (I was dragged there lol). My friends ordered two different types of steaks and liked them quite a lot. I had a bite of both and did not like them AT all?they were tough and covered with a greasy sauce...not appetizing at all.  I just stuck to cheesy smashed potatoes which I found surprisingly good and ordered a drink called lava ice which was basically hersheys syrup in cold milk..not recommended.. I couldn?t bring myself to order anything else there. That place is not for me.\n\nI have to try tutti frutti atleast twice a week.. they had lychee this week which is my favourite..didn?t like pistachio..i don?t think it?s a good flavor for froyo..it is nutty and a bit like taro but taro is much much better.\n\nAnd yes, I got rolls from Eaton. Chicken chutney rolls. Fresh crisp paratha with spicy chutney and tender chicken boti?. Tasted Amazing!!! These rolls followed by a huge cup of coffee ice cream from kaybees made for a completely satisfying (not to mention economical) meal..yumm","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-17T17:13:07+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-17T17:13:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"682241004","name":"Atif Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjgyMjQxMDA0","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"restaurantName":"Eaton"}]}
