Easily enough, an amazing experience. The manager there is one of the most friendly people that I've come across, and at a time when everybody's having their iftaar and eating about, he was polite enough to keep his food on hold and serve us instead. The guy there, Winston was extremely polite and welcoming too, and was quick with the suggestions. In the end, we went for the 'All you can eat' deal, and I have to say, the pizzas there are some of the best that Karachi has to offer. I'm sure the restaurant started out as a direct rival to Pizza Hut, but it has far surpassed them in terms of quality and service. The pizzas were served piping hot right on time, and Winston was even nice enough to get me a salad of his own accord. Their Chicken Tikka, Sicilian Chicken and Fajita are easily the best flavors that you can get anywhere in Karachi. Extremely polite, prompt and to top it all off, the food was absolutely amazing. It's good to see the manager himself taking an interest and asking if everything was okay. More eateries need to focus on customer management and relations, and I was pleasantly surprised that Pizza One pays attention to such fine details. All in all, an amazing experience, and for me, this year's biggest surprise and a must try goes to Pizza One. I've become a total fan of the food and the place itself, and I'd recommend it to anybody whose looking for some real good food and friendly service. For those who are looking for some idea of their taste: Pizza Hut pales in comparison, and yes they are better than 14th Street Pizza. Great stuff. \n\nP.S This was the branch on the Chartered Accountant's Avenue.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-04T17:08:06+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-04T23:50:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"526480602","name":"Kashan Munawar"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"100000311538556","name":"Shahbaz Lalani"},{"id":"1054317406","name":"Arsalan Ahmed"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"1419404438","name":"Muhammad Ahsan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQxOTQwNDQzOA\u003d\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"598216840229470","from":{"name":"Fariha Tungekar","id":"706770021"},"message":"What about the napkins?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-04T18:16:09+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"598217076896113","from":{"name":"Najm Ahmed","id":"885480695"},"message":"We asked them for plenty.
