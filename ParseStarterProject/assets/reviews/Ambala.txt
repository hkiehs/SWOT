Was not expecting Karachi's weather to be this cold and windy. There was only one family before us and by the time we left only two more came. The place was largely empty. \n\nOrdered Chicken boneless karahi and spicy fish tikka along with paratha, garlic nan and roghni nan. \nThe food was superb. Karahi was better than many places I tried recently, and fish was also excellent. The prices are also reasonable, and food for 3 costed only Rs. 1,700.\n\nThey only need to improve on their service. They brought naans without a napkin and in that weather they turned cold pretty quickly. Had to ask for a napkin. They served fish and raita uncovered too. Otherwise, the staff was courteous and service quick. Overall a pretty good experience. Will definitely recommend.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-22T08:27:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-22T13:36:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"691642690","name":"Hira Tariq"},{"id":"762775146","name":"Syed Faraz Baqar"},{"id":"851800404","name":"Aamna Mansoor Badshah"},{"id":"601955407","name":"Rashid H Ansari"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"},{"id":"100001263140827","name":"Fahad Tariq Bhirya"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100006186248618","name":"Sehr Shaikh"},{"id":"1282983841","name":"Hamza Kapadia"},{"id":"100000720206680","name":"Shazia A.

And then I hear mostly good reviews about the same place. And when I do try the place, the positive vibes have been proved correct. Kolachi and Tutti Frutti are the 2 places in subject here. \n\nHad the chocolate and the original flavor and I am at a loss for words. This was the most amazing willy-wonka-ish experience since Funland. I felt like a kid in Disneyland. The froyo is yummy, the place is oozing with colors, smiles, flavor and so much positivity. I was delighted! The delegate was in a rush so we couldnt wait for the toppings (sad) but they looked yum. But anyways the fro-yo was to-die-for. No after taste, the original was tangy..just enough tangy.....and the chocolate was a little like dark chocolate...and mixed together it was heaven. Oh yeah and it had the best consistency right till the last lick. And yes priced beautifully. P.S - No receipts. But oh well.\n\nKolachi. Man. Charcoal's ambiance has taken a back seat in my books. WHAT a place, tastefully done, EXCELLENT sofas and seating, Kolachi is a must-visit. Now for the food, FINALLY  a place on phase 8 that is a complete package! Food AND ambiance! Had the Hunzai Handi. OMG. It was divine. The right balance of spice and gravy with soft tender pieces of chicken that melts in your mouth, this is a must have. The bihari boti and paratha were nothing to write home about as I have had better. Honestly, these two items were Charcoal's standard. Bland. But that handi and oh yes! the prawn starter totally nailed it! The prices are steep - 1 starter, 1 handi and 1 plate bihari kebab, 2 nans and 1 paratha, 1 large water bottle and 1 drink Rs. 2180. Steep as the quantity was exactly for 2 people (nothing was left over) which means that it is expensive and less quantity (1000 per head) Having said that, if you have plans for phase 8, this is where u wanna go.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-31T19:45:34+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-01T09:26:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"828190023","name":"Shaheen Nouman"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQxNDk1NjI1","before":"ODI4MTkwMDIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"389951377722685","from":{"name":"Lubna Ashraf Jafri","id":"501447368"},"message":"Wow, sounds like someone had a great experience at both the places and is satiated :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-31T22:23:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"389951684389321","from":{"name":"Lubna Ashraf Jafri","id":"501447368"},"message":"I love both TF and Kolachi too :)\nTF gotta be my favorite place for froyo these days!

And i like mine well done so i made sure to tell him many times that it HAS to be well done, and thankfully it was. Juicy, flavorful and well done. My steak was just great.
