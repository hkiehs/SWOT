And that even because it had 'some' taste.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-12T16:59:57+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-12T22:57:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000058392601","name":"Shauzab Murad"},{"id":"100000917370405","name":"Saad Aftab"},{"id":"100001262753914","name":"Musti Khan"},{"id":"513274653","name":"Amna Hussain"},{"id":"650618407","name":"Zeeshan Lakhani"},{"id":"1663385054","name":"Ashab Adeel"},{"id":"1056262977","name":"Umer Zahoor"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA1NjI2Mjk3Nw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTAwMDAwMDU4MzkyNjAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"665722220145598","from":{"name":"Ahmareen Bari","id":"756940336"},"message":"Tell me what your mom said to you?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T18:55:06+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665722733478880","from":{"name":"Sameer Mirjat","id":"515558572"},"message":"\"Was this your idea Sameer?\"","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T18:56:42+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665723820145438","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"Aur dow sasti treat, thora kharcha karna tha na :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T18:59:58+0000","like_count":11,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665723926812094","from":{"name":"Ahmareen Bari","id":"756940336"},"message":"She got class.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T19:00:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665724543478699","from":{"name":"Sameer Mirjat","id":"515558572"},"message":"Office k baad jitni energy bachti hai, yehi hota hai Ramlaj.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T19:02:28+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665724586812028","from":{"name":"Sameer Mirjat","id":"515558572"},"message":"Ramlah* :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T19:02:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665726140145206","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"Bss kar dai olivetto lai jata, walking distance hai :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T19:06:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665726426811844","from":{"name":"Sameer Mirjat","id":"515558572"},"message":"Next time apse le loun ga ideas maym saab? :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T19:07:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665730686811418","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"Good boy :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T19:23:15+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665733776811109","from":{"name":"Amna Hussain","id":"513274653"},"message":"Order from GD tomorrow, that will definitely make her happy!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T19:34:32+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665743553476798","from":{"name":"Marium Khan","id":"100007013108103"},"message":"strange..

Again i reiterate giving tip is the sole discretion of the customer, one cannot be forced to pay 10% or any set amount if the service levels are not up to his satisfaction.Even a small gesture like responding early to a customer when called,lighting his cigarette or refilling his glass are ways to earns an extra buck, but only if they put in that extra effort otherwise its all run in the mill these days. Only at the time they present the bill, they look at you with yearning eyes, as if they expect a wholesome amount, which one cant blame them for in this day and age of galloping inflation. Their is and will always be some disparity between the wages restaurant staff earns and what is actually paid to them, good establishments are judicious in their approach and pass on 100% of tip collected amount to their service staff + kitchen staff too as they are part of the team. Regular foodies can always make out how well the establishments treats their staff by noticing their behavior and period of service, bad pay masters have high turnover of staff and are not able to maintain service levels while reputed restos nurture their staff over a period of time and good service levels is the key to their success.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-30T10:17:48+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"642000712517749","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Sonoo Salman Shaikh sb:- Yes correct 10% is the full and final amount and one does not need to give anything besides that.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-30T10:19:13+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"642180005833153","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Azam Sultan Ahmed what's up?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-30T18:30:39+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","type":"user","offset":0,"length":17}]},{"id":"642181059166381","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Hello Irfan!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-30T18:33:27+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"642183175832836","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"what's your view on the restaurants charging GST but not actually filing a return with the exchequer? multiple examples of a gst registration but the amount being pocketed...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-30T18:40:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"642200115831142","from":{"name":"Owais Asif","id":"690005614"},"message":"I think putting services charges is not the wisest thing to do . A job of a waiter is similiar to a factory worker working on piece rate . \r\nHe needs  constant motivation to deliver good service , which means on every table he has to over come his ego ; past grumphy customers, his personnel problems and his tiredness to deliver good service. And for that he needs a constant motivation of money in form of tips. The rule should be better service better tips similiar to a factory worker doing more piece and making more money. \r\nImposing a service charge means the waiter would get a fix amount of money wether he deliver a good service or not or wether he lights a cigratte for a customer or not or wether he brings an ashtray for the customer when he is smoking or not or if he responds to the customer or not ..  And this is one reason why worldwide service staffs are usually paid at or slighly above the minimum wage rate and make the majority of their earnings  from  tips. \r\n\nbut saying that we live in a society where some of us do tip good but majority of us take good service for granted.

The corn dusting on the bottom gave it some ... Umm ...well, made it seem less like roti. A bit too greasy though for my liking, still bettet than others.\n\nIt could have used a bit more pepperoni to be honest.\n\nAnd I must praise sauce. A simple tomato sauce ... Not loaded with spices or anything. Simple rich tomatoey goodness. The way it should be on a Pizza.\n\nTo sum it up. A good crust, with a rich tomatoey sauce on top, fair bit of pepperoni topped with a good bit of cheese. Proper pizza. \n\nAnd at 400rs it was a better deal than a slice from 14th Street at Rs. 350.

Fortnightly Pizzo indulgence at Chai Dhaba.  The best thing about Pizzo is that it can deliver Pizza in a timely manner at the most random places.\n\nOrdered the Pepperoni Pizza, and like always it was excellent.  Just the right amount of Cheese and Pepperoni, with a firm crust.  No one does a better Deep Pan Pepperoni than Pizzo.\n\nFor experimental purposes, also ordered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, and that was a major disaster.  The pizza was loaded with all sort of assortments, putting Pizza Hut to shame.  The guy taking the order said it will be spicy -- but I never thought spicy meant dumping half a bottle of tabasco sauce on the pizza.  There was just too much happening on the pizza, and the tabasco was overpowering.\n\nBeing a loyal Pizzo customer, the best combination to order from Pizzo is Pepperoni & Margherita.  Buffalo Chicken should be strictly avoided!\n\nOverall Rating (for this meal) -- 5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-16T11:04:02+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T12:53:25+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1668177824","name":"Omer Salimullah"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzMyOTE3OTY4","before":"MTY2ODE3NzgyNA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619702711414216","from":{"name":"Nasim Ahmad","id":"1343979604"},"message":"It's incredible how many pizzerias have opened in the past year and every one seems to have its fans.

Easily enough, an amazing experience. The manager there is one of the most friendly people that I've come across, and at a time when everybody's having their iftaar and eating about, he was polite enough to keep his food on hold and serve us instead. The guy there, Winston was extremely polite and welcoming too, and was quick with the suggestions. In the end, we went for the 'All you can eat' deal, and I have to say, the pizzas there are some of the best that Karachi has to offer. I'm sure the restaurant started out as a direct rival to Pizza Hut, but it has far surpassed them in terms of quality and service. The pizzas were served piping hot right on time, and Winston was even nice enough to get me a salad of his own accord. Their Chicken Tikka, Sicilian Chicken and Fajita are easily the best flavors that you can get anywhere in Karachi. Extremely polite, prompt and to top it all off, the food was absolutely amazing. It's good to see the manager himself taking an interest and asking if everything was okay. More eateries need to focus on customer management and relations, and I was pleasantly surprised that Pizza One pays attention to such fine details. All in all, an amazing experience, and for me, this year's biggest surprise and a must try goes to Pizza One. I've become a total fan of the food and the place itself, and I'd recommend it to anybody whose looking for some real good food and friendly service. For those who are looking for some idea of their taste: Pizza Hut pales in comparison, and yes they are better than 14th Street Pizza. Great stuff. \n\nP.S This was the branch on the Chartered Accountant's Avenue.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-04T17:08:06+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-04T23:50:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"526480602","name":"Kashan Munawar"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"100000311538556","name":"Shahbaz Lalani"},{"id":"1054317406","name":"Arsalan Ahmed"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"1419404438","name":"Muhammad Ahsan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQxOTQwNDQzOA\u003d\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"598216840229470","from":{"name":"Fariha Tungekar","id":"706770021"},"message":"What about the napkins?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-04T18:16:09+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"598217076896113","from":{"name":"Najm Ahmed","id":"885480695"},"message":"We asked them for plenty.

Its clearly mentioned on the flyers that its free delivery. The deal commences at 11pm & ends at 1am. \nThe surprising part is that this 'additional fee' is not the same for every branch & doesn't vary according to the distance of ur location from the branch. The branch farther from my house charges lesser than the branch that's hardly 3 minutes drive from my house. When I probed as to what this additional charge consists of, I was told its just a fee that I have to pay, without any reason & where they charge Rs. 60 on midnight deal delivery, they wud be fine even if I pay Rs. 50 or 40 even. To confirm if this was justified, I called up KDA branch & asked them y I was being made to pay this charge which had no purpose & was not fixed or even mentioned anywhere on the flyers or menu cards. The staff at the KDA branch said that the Bahadurabad branch maybe charging me this 'additional fee' because they 'felt like it' and 'unho ne aisay he boldya hoga!!' They assured me that no subway outlet was charging this fee and next time I should place my order with the KDA branch. I did that last night & they too charged me the extra charges that they have never been able to explain to me. When I told them about my conversation with them last time, they said 'madam aisa actually hota nahe hai, chalein aaap 40 rupees dey dein! Without it they wudnt deliver any midnight meals.
