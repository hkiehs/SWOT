In case anyone has second thoughts, DONT. Scoot over any BK first thing tomorrow and end the last weekend of 2013 in heaven...\n\nCalifornia Pizza - Fajita Sicilian. The place - done up v well (seaview branch), great servers, fast pizza serving time and a yummy-to-the-core pizza. Not Broadway ki takkar ka, but yummy nonetheless....kinda sorta like Pizza Point yummy.\n\nRoast Beef Burger from Chips.

Fortnightly Pizzo indulgence at Chai Dhaba.  The best thing about Pizzo is that it can deliver Pizza in a timely manner at the most random places.\n\nOrdered the Pepperoni Pizza, and like always it was excellent.  Just the right amount of Cheese and Pepperoni, with a firm crust.  No one does a better Deep Pan Pepperoni than Pizzo.\n\nFor experimental purposes, also ordered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, and that was a major disaster.  The pizza was loaded with all sort of assortments, putting Pizza Hut to shame.  The guy taking the order said it will be spicy -- but I never thought spicy meant dumping half a bottle of tabasco sauce on the pizza.  There was just too much happening on the pizza, and the tabasco was overpowering.\n\nBeing a loyal Pizzo customer, the best combination to order from Pizzo is Pepperoni & Margherita.  Buffalo Chicken should be strictly avoided!\n\nOverall Rating (for this meal) -- 5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-16T11:04:02+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T12:53:25+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1668177824","name":"Omer Salimullah"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzMyOTE3OTY4","before":"MTY2ODE3NzgyNA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619702711414216","from":{"name":"Nasim Ahmad","id":"1343979604"},"message":"It's incredible how many pizzerias have opened in the past year and every one seems to have its fans.
