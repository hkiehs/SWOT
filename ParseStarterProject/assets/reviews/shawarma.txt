The best thing we tried though was the lamb kebabs - I cant remembers the names of which ones we ordered but they were brilliant. The chicken shawrma was pretty decent too. Being greedy we ordered a mixed grill (it was off the menu, asked the owner to give us a sampling of the best grilled meat on their menu) as well and I liked the saffron chicken though the lamb kebabs, different ones this time, in the mixed grill platter stole the show. Anyone who like lebanese food should try the place. It is very close to the Lebanese food served in London and the lamb kebabs are a must try.

I had decided against going to another Burger King for a while.\nBut sadly was dragged to BK Nishat yesterday. Well this time my experience was the complete opposite.\n\nAs usual they didn't have the Angus Steakhouse. (-_-)\n\nOrdered Two Double Woopers with cheese and one Chicken Mc.Royale. \n\nI still stand on what I wrote previously about The Chicken Mc.Royale. It is still the saddest and driest burger ever known to man. It's drier then the sahara desert. The lettuce this time was fresh though. \n\nThe Whoopers are a complete different story! I can easily say they tasted very close to the international taste. Was fresh, juicy and perfectly cooked. \n\nThe fries were better at the Sea View branch. The ones over here tasted very average.\nI'm surprised at the taste difference in both the branches of the same place. Burger king needs to work on consistency.\n\nPlus I noticed the staff at the Nishat branch is better trained. They are quite helpful with selection and we were told that the Chicken Royale would be on the dry side.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-11-09T15:12:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-09T22:27:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"782634552","name":"Sibtain Raza Rizvi"},{"id":"100000522564819","name":"Imran Bahadur"},{"id":"100000000311471","name":"Zeeshan Mirza"},{"id":"100001010415651","name":"Why Khan"},{"id":"626070061","name":"Salman Aly"},{"id":"770944605","name":"Hasnain Hanif"},{"id":"622340233","name":"Imran Ahmad"},{"id":"571357266","name":"Khurram Zameer"},{"id":"531081230","name":"Jaipal Metai"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100001072766153","name":"Akbar Marri"},{"id":"558178102","name":"Safoora Fahad"},{"id":"100000968320453","name":"Umair Ali Khokhar"},{"id":"1037741430","name":"Shahan Khan"},{"id":"100001915683645","name":"Kanza Hussan"},{"id":"100001660620072","name":"Shumail Rafi"},{"id":"1475984626","name":"Shoaib Mohammad Quraishi"},{"id":"100000744651030","name":"Farah Sadiq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzQ0NjUxMDMw","before":"NzgyNjM0NTUy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"647463431971477","from":{"name":"Ahmed I Mehanti","id":"653913361"},"message":"Okay so it's a Whopper*","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:06:38+0000","like_count":12,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647464341971386","from":{"name":"Rayyan Sohail","id":"728987421"},"message":"\"Mc.Royale\" ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:09:48+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647465135304640","from":{"name":"Irfan Mohammad Aslam","id":"861405103"},"message":"Ayesha Khan happy iqbal day :P iqbal jee hotay to apki nazam parh kar buhat kush hotay !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:12:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"647465148637972","from":{"name":"Ibrahim M Khalil","id":"724095104"},"message":"WTF is this?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:12:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647465825304571","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Ahmed I Mehanti grammer Nazi much lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:15:34+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"653913361","name":"Ahmed I Mehanti","type":"user","offset":0,"length":15}]},{"id":"647466138637873","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Rayyan Sohail I meant chicken royale.

Placed an order for 3 chicken ones, one plain, one with fries and the last thier new addition which is the garlic mayo Shawarma. Was initially given a delivery time for an hour but instead was delivered in a mind bobbling 2 hours.\nSo here are the flavor reviews\n\n*Garlic mayo: First bite inn it was quite creamy and nice, but too much black pepper for my taste and leaves a pepperish after taste. So it's good for people who like that. It was also a bit on the oily side.\n\n*The one with fries: Tasted pretty good. Very close to the ones back in Jeddah. \n\n*The plain one: YUMM. My favorite just chicken and sauce. Loved it the most. The closest one to the ones in the Middle East.\n\nDrawbacks: Was delivered cold had to microwave it, would suggest them to start a proper delivery if they decide to continue delivering. Also they should be sure on thier delivery timing as I dont mind waiting when I'm giving a specific time but then the delays become annoying esp when one has mice running around in thier bellies.\n\nWould advice to go and enjoy it thier rather then ordering as there is a huge quality and taste bump.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-07T16:34:18+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-09T17:36:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1079532434","name":"Anisa Fadoo"},{"id":"501516047","name":"Zubair Farooq Dadi"},{"id":"100003533323814","name":"Sarah Muhammad"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"1385439948","name":"Danesh F.Khambatta"},{"id":"1118291942","name":"Umair Yaqoob"},{"id":"100000679437817","name":"Yasir Hameed"},{"id":"539697815","name":"Sherbaz Khan"},{"id":"8000747","name":"Ayesha Mohammed"},{"id":"1666329533","name":"Sarah Talha Farooqui"},{"id":"560960287","name":"Muhammad Gulzaib Ali Khan"},{"id":"617851264","name":"Qaisar Imtiaz Pirzada"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE3ODUxMjY0","before":"MTA3OTUzMjQzNA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"615359198515234","from":{"name":"Muhammad Gulzaib Ali Khan","id":"560960287"},"message":"how much for 1 shawarma?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T16:54:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615360571848430","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"150","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T16:59:13+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615364868514667","from":{"name":"Fiza Shabir","id":"1519835339"},"message":"Very economical , missing khi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T17:06:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615370175180803","from":{"name":"Muhammad Gulzaib Ali Khan","id":"560960287"},"message":"Not bad, i think they have just started so the delivery time must be under consideration.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T17:11:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615371545180666","from":{"name":"Oraiba Ezza","id":"618536135"},"message":"Where is it located","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T17:15:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615372141847273","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Parking lot of aghas.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T17:17:42+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615388161845671","from":{"name":"Waqas Tariq","id":"1088744265"},"message":"Phone number?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T18:06:48+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615400481844439","from":{"name":"Yasir Hameed","id":"100000679437817"},"message":"location?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T18:43:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"615400561844431","from":{"name":"Yasir Hameed","id":"100000679437817"},"message":"M Babar Saeed","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-07T18:43:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"594039575","name":"M Babar Saeed","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"615409058510248","from":{"name":"Danesh F.Khambatta","id":"1385439948"},"message":"Mice running in the belly lolz...wonder if its got anything to  do with belly dancers !

Giving in to the glutton in us, we obviously over ordered but miraculously, wiped most of it clean off the plate. Service was swift, with no mix-ups in the order AND most importantly an abundant supply of icecream soda!! The Pita sandwich with it's crispy pita and melt in your mouth cheese, is highly recommended if you like your cheese, but if you're up for the more subtle flavors of a slightly toasted shawarma with a brush of garlic sauce and hint of chilli, i suggest you try the basic chicken shawarma, it is yum! The piece de resistance for me, however, has always been the shawarma platter. I don't like to share it, and rarely am i able to finish it, but no trip to Damsacus is justified if it is not ordered. All in all Damascus made 4 tummy's very happy last night!

The chicken was cooked well and while it wasn't hot, it was well wrapped in foil so it wasn't too bad. The chicken was not as moist as I expected but with the dipping sauces, ended up being a reasonably good main course. Pita bread was fine and generous in quantity. There were some good dipping sauces and salsa style of veggies that were tasty. \n\nThe sides were generally disappointing in their \"averageness\". The roasted potatoes were dry and not particularly appealing. The mash and gravy were fine but nothing special. The hummus was just alright in taste but given that it is the most expensive side on the menu, the quantity was really miniscule and the taste should have been more impressive. \n\nAll in all, no actual complaints about the food, but overall it just didn't compare particularly favorably to the traditional alternatives available. Maybe the food would have tasted better at the restaurant or will improve with the passage of time from adjustments due to consumer feedback and experience.  Would love to keep hearing what others are saying since we only tried one major item on the menu and there may be other things worth tasting.\n\nFor about 2200 bucks, I did expect a higher standard of taste but again, it may just take a little time for things to settle down since this is such a new establishment. We'll just have to give it some time and try Rowtisserie again to see if things are any better. However, I will say that they seem to have responded well to the initial delivery time issues so maybe there is hope for the rest!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-24T17:46:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-24T18:51:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNDU2MDU5MDk1","before":"ODQwNjE5NTEw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"526483150736173","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"i have not checked the menu yet - but all i hear is CHICKEN CHICKEN - dont they have beef/lamb or even mutton\n\ni am not going to eat chicken","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:42:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"526485184069303","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"They hv beef shawarma.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:48:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"526485470735941","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"oh thank god","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:49:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"526485787402576","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"I'll wait for them to start dine-in to give Rowtisserie another shot.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:50:43+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"526486047402550","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"i will do a take away in about 2 weeks - if they dont start dine-in by then\n\nIrfan Ismail am taking you up on your offer","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-24T18:51:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail","type":"user","offset":77,"length":12}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI2NDg2MDQ3NDAyNTUw","before":"NTI2NDgzMTUwNzM2MTcz"}}},"restaurantName":"shawarma"},{"id":"165861103465048_526347237416431","from":{"name":"Shaikh Fawad","id":"694238742"},"message":"I don't know about \"authentic Turkish food\" but I have been to Istanbul at least twice in the last 3 years...

Their lamb shawarma- better then any other shawarma I've tried, comes highly recommended.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-27T04:24:13+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-27T20:33:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000349262919","name":"Fiza Khuhro"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100002330340236","name":"Adeel Zafar Soomro"},{"id":"714115614","name":"Nefer Sehgal"},{"id":"517798722","name":"Omar Khan"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"517558557","name":"Huma Imran"},{"id":"679913965","name":"Hina Dhanani"},{"id":"500951481","name":"Rasti Ahmed"},{"id":"517361095","name":"Muhmmad Mehdi Siddiq"},{"id":"223600909","name":"Ahsan Shah"},{"id":"585785400","name":"Asad Aly Dhanani"},{"id":"522705412","name":"Marvi Shah"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ2NjY0NTM4","before":"MTAwMDAwMzQ5MjYyOTE5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"417489711635518","from":{"name":"Fatima Javed","id":"513648490"},"message":"LOVEEE the shawarmas from damascus and their garlic sauce is THE BEST!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-27T12:10:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417506304967192","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"good to know that some people will still eat there - i stopped after getting a burger that was made from all the left over meat in a butcher shop. it was utterly disgusting\n\nnever bothered to complain but have never gone back - \n\nprefer Arabian Nights for the outdoor-arabic-sheesha- experience","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-27T13:14:32+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417512904966532","from":{"name":"Hareem Sumbul","id":"501415716"},"message":"Oooh Arabian Nights is the one.

I would not have bothered replying if it was coming from one of many known self-appointed food connoisseurs and saviors of taste buds around the city; found mostly on Facebook food forums at all times of the day, their frustrations justified by the amount of time they spend ranting about the food they eat. And no, I won't be naming them. I am replying because it is coming from an educated person like you who I believe belongs to a respectable part of society and must have a genuine grievance to repeat such a complain everywhere possible. Whatever it may be, please accept my personal apology. With that said, I assure you, our 'beef' is purchased from Makro, which does not sell scrap or left overs no matter how nicely you ask, the beef is then minced at our restaurant, the trimmings and fat are cooked, with left over pita, bread, chicken and rice, and fed to my dogs, I have four; very loving, all of them.  Anyway, so we make an honest living by selling only the best available ingredients on the market, the sauces, marinades, and spices are all prepared at home in presence of at least one family member. While there is a margin of error in every food outlet, the climate not being very friendly and dependable staff being a constant nuisance, I can understand if the food you ordered arrived under- or overcooked, or if the spices were too little or too much, or something similar. But to accuse us of selling low quality food on purpose is unacceptable, not only because I'm saying so being a representative of Damascus, but also because it is the same food I eat at home, five days out of seven. I invite you to Damascus, make it a surprise if you like, we can both order a burger each to see what left over scrap I'm selling, & I promise not to cheat.

And then the alleged patrons of Damascus were suggesting that I should not have made my bad experience public on forums like SWOT and KFD as it shows that I have some of a personal vendetta against Damascus. One even suggested that I am perhaps getting paid by someone to bad mouth Damascus. Damascus' establishment merely suggested that I may be suffering from some sort of a allergy and they could not find anything in their records regarding my order and that they will get back to me. They merely let loose their hounds on me and never actually got back to me and did not offer an apology for my horrifying experience and the illness I have been suffering due to their food. I finally ended up going to the doctor today and he informed me that I am suffering from a throat infection. I specifically asked him if is possible that I may have contracted it from bad and/or rotten chicken. He said yes, it is very much possible. I am hereby completely writing off Damascus and will be never visiting it again.

The pastries over there were divine , I had the rasberry cheescake and the caramel eclairs WOWZA! They're pretty pricey at around SAR 10 - 15 a piece but totally worth it. You can also buy a cup of Coffee over there , so it makes for a great breakfast. There are loads of small ghetto-ish looking Turkish Cafe's in Makkah they do awesome \"Doner Kebabs\" \"Iskander Kebabs\" and \"Qabsa\" definitely head to one of them ask any local in the city where the nearest \"MATAM TURKIYE\"  (Arabic for Turkish Restaurant) is . There are a bunch of Sudanese and various African run establishments slightly away from the Haram circle look for the signs saying \"FUUL\" (in Arabic) , just for being adventurous try Fuul its like an African delicacy made of beans, chickpeas and various spices .  If by any chance you start to miss Pakistani food head to the Hotel Ravi in Madinah its right across the street from Al Baik if I am not wrong there's only one Al Baik in Madinah. OMG that place does the best Pakistani food I've had outside Pakistan , great Chicken Karahi , Chicken Achari and by far the best Lassi I've ever had (seriously even Lahore couldn't beat it ). One word of advice the best food in both of the cities is in areas slightly away from the respective Haram circles. If you plan to stay within the Haram areas then your choices are restricted to the cliche  Starbucks, KFC, McD's , Hardees , Baskin & Robbins and really really bad Shawarma's .

The pastries over there were divine , I had the rasberry cheescake and the caramel eclairs WOWZA! They're pretty pricey at around SAR 10 - 15 a piece but totally worth it. You can also buy a cup of Coffee over there , so it makes for a great breakfast. There are loads of small ghetto-ish looking Turkish Cafe's in Makkah they do awesome \"Doner Kebabs\" \"Iskander Kebabs\" and \"Qabsa\" definitely head to one of them ask any local in the city where the nearest \"MATAM TURKIYE\"  (Arabic for Turkish Restaurant) is . There are a bunch of Sudanese and various African run establishments slightly away from the Haram circle look for the signs saying \"FUUL\" (in Arabic) , just for being adventurous try Fuul its like an African delicacy made of beans, chickpeas and various spices .  If by any chance you start to miss Pakistani food head to the Hotel Ravi in Madinah its right across the street from Al Baik if I am not wrong there's only one Al Baik in Madinah. OMG that place does the best Pakistani food I've had outside Pakistan , great Chicken Karahi , Chicken Achari and by far the best Lassi I've ever had (seriously even Lahore couldn't beat it ). One word of advice the best food in both of the cities is in areas slightly away from the respective Haram circles. If you plan to stay within the Haram areas then your choices are restricted to the cliche  Starbucks, KFC, McD's , Hardees , Baskin & Robbins and really really bad Shawarma's . Try to venture out a bit .","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-14T09:55:44+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"378880855496404","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"Do visit Bin-Dawood in Makkah Towers right next to inter-continental Makkah.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-14T10:00:50+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"378886018829221","from":{"name":"Shafia Agha","id":"650845003"},"message":"Al Tazaj is a must","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-14T10:18:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"378886188829204","from":{"name":"Shafia Agha","id":"650845003"},"message":"and ofcourse shawarmas in medinah which come stuffed with fries and white sauce!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-14T10:18:27+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"378886885495801","from":{"name":"Tabish R.

Decided on ordering the food from Arab Connection. Placed the order for Belly Dancer and Beefita / Chickita. On a brighter the service was excellent and the food arrived on the time they had committed. Another plus point would that the food is very very reasonably priced. \n\nThe Belly Dancer which is a replacement of sort of shawarmas was a disappointment. I thought it would have the authentic taste of Middle East as claimed on their facebook page, it was nowhere to be found. It was nothing like the shawarmas that are served in Saudi Arabia. SWOTTIES who have been for Umrah / Hajj would probably know what I am talking about as it has a very specific taste which I have yet to sample in Pakistan. \n\nThe Beefita / Chickita was at best, average. The taste was bland though it did have a decent serving. The only good thing about the meal was their dipping sauces aka the three wishes. The fries that came along were sort of a replica of the fries found at the likes of Kaybees or Red Apple. Basically they change colours in a few hours if you do not consume them. \n\nThough the place has been getting good reviews my experience was a little disappointing. I do not think I'd be ordering from them any time soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-16T15:44:32+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-17T07:05:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100000578236531","name":"Naheed Asim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNTc4MjM2NTMx","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"278913335493157","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"I ordered from there last week.

From chicken Al-mandi i really liked the chicken it was a big piece and really soft and tender from the inside while having a thin juicy layer above, the rice could have been better as it was a bit rough and lacked taste and few pieces were stuck to each other and the spicy sauce that came with it wasnt too spicy and i suggest to make the consistency thicker so i felt that its better to order the chicken with pita bread. The chikita wasnt the authentic shawarma i hoped it to be it was chicken pieces on a skewer but the chicked tasted good. It came with pita bread and garlic tahini sauce and i asked for muttabil sauce which they gave eventhough they usually dont give it with the chikita and both sauces were great so good customer service oh and it also came with fries which were reallly really good and my bill was 318 so that was really good value for money and the food quantity was great too and since they've just started i hope they will improve :)","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-14T07:22:32+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-14T07:22:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTIxOTA4NDU0","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"restaurantName":"shawarma"},{"id":"165861103465048_277203645664126","from":{"name":"Sarah J.K","id":"708025491"},"message":"Camel milk is the future!
