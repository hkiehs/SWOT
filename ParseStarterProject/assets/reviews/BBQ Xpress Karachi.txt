We were a group of friends and we like to eat so we tried a few things on the menu. The club sandwich was really good, finally a place which decides not to use a soggy piece of lettuce but instead it tasted fresh and good, my friend ordered the chicken tikka which tasted amazing the correct amount of spice and tangyness to it , the Bbq shashlaik reminded me of a place in Mohd ali society called zeenan and the last thing the zinger again the only place i have found yet to use ice berg lettuce in their burger which again was fresh and a little crunchy instead of the soggy things at other place. Over all it was a great experience, left with a good taste and my wallet wasnt as light as i thought it would be","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-13T21:44:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-13T21:44:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"550220458","name":"Humayun Azhar"},{"id":"766330120","name":"Shayan Pervez"},{"id":"1511554294","name":"Huma Mohiuddin"},{"id":"594427530","name":"Fawzia Zehra Kara-Isitt"},{"id":"100000887137962","name":"Sahr Mubashir"},{"id":"660885104","name":"Junaid Mansoor Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjYwODg1MTA0","before":"NTUwMjIwNDU4"}}},"restaurantName":"BBQ Xpress Karachi"}]}
