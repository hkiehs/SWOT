It's gotta be one of the prettiest places to eat at in Karachi, and they have added splashes of color that made the place even more lively.\n\nOrdered 2 doodh patties and 2 house blend cinnamon elaichi chai...\nAnd one walnut chocolate chip pudding with chocolate sauce. And one banofee pie. While ordering I asked the waiter what were these served with as in ice cream or cream.....he said neither. S we asked him to bring us some scoops in a bowl. \n\nThe teas were fresh and aromatic. Thu doodh patti has to be had at a dhaaba, but this was pretty good, MSK loved the house blended. Te desserts were interesting but I found the walnut pudding a little dry on the inside. The banofee was quite authentic but a little TOO rich and dense. It was left over even with 4 people attacking it. \n\nAlong with a big bottle of mineral water and tip it was 300/- a head.\n\nThe weather is becoming totally Koel Worthy.
