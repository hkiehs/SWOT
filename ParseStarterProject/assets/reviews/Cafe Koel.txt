Tried the Vietnamese Cha-Cha today. Glass noodles, prawn and fish with veggies, plus various condiments (finely sliced green onions, crushed peanuts, sesame seeds, and two sauces. The presentation was great, the taste was pretty good too. The prawn and fish were good, but was too much of a mish-mash of veggies. By the time i added my sauces for that extra kick, it became a bit soggy. My recommendation is to make the prawn & fish drier. The chopsticks were not the dry disposable kind, but the re-usable slippery kind so i could not eat the noodles with that and had resort to using the fork. Mostly pros then cons. Oh, their fiery hot drink which is a mix of pineapple juice, cucumber and green chili is super refreshing!","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-01T18:16:29+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-02T06:48:51+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMDE0NDc1NjIw","before":"MTQ0MjI3MTY4Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"269753003075857","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Koel has some very good innovative dishes.
