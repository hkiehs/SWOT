Went to Riverwood cafe today with a gathering, the first thing that ticked me off was the rule that everyone of us had to order drinks just to sit there. But fair enough. The thing that got me fumed up was a 500 rupee surcharge on the bill, written with a pen, besides the usual 200 rupee service charge as eidhi. Are you freakin kidding me? They expect us to spend 800 rupee on an overpriced shisha, 200 rupee service charge, along with 50% of the original amount as eidhi? We refused to pay outright, the manager did make a spoiled face when we were leaving, but this is downright derogatory. They expect people who come to these cafes to pay 500 rupee by unfairly slapping this exhobarant amount on the bill, and pressuring them to pay just to save face and embarrassment.

The number of dishes they are offering are very less and you can in a way ignore that fact if they tasted good-Spring rolls were STALE. The quality has gone done and so has the service. I asked for ketchup on my table and the waiter went like \"Wahan jahan buffet hai wahan parhi tou hai.\" I was like there is no harm if i am asking for it on my table as i didnt spot it there. I got the same response when i asked for an extra fork while having food. Above all, the pamphlet on my table said it is rs 799 including tax and when the bill came they had charged extra tax saying madam we have changed the deal claiming that the pamphlet is old. Also, they had charged a good amount of Rs 300 as service charges (what kind of service are they providing when they cant get me ketchup or extra cutlery on my table.) The story doesnt end here, apparently they also charged for an extra lemonade whereas it was part of the deal and we didnt order any extra lemonade. Anyway the management apologized but the whole point is when you go out you want to have a good time not to deal with different sort of hassles.
