It need not be a fine dining place..\n\nOver the last 2+ years all I have seen in Karachi are different trends.. One person dares challenge Pizza Hut with a new very different offering and it becomes a hit among us 'the foodies'.. Next few weeks we see the numerous pizza places open up.. some are good some are OK but after a few weeks they all taste the same.. Then came the thin crust era (No offence to anyone I totally love Domino's Thin Crust pizza)  and everyone from Domino's and bakeries and cafe selling the thin crust..\n\nWhile everyone was enjoying the 20 inches pizza, Hardees came to town.. There again began this trend of selling burgers.. And its still ongoing..Everyday there is a new place advertising themselves..\n\nIs there any place in Karachi that offers something other than burgers and pizza and pasta which tastes good too... I don't mind having sea food or steaks (No Arizona or Roasters pls) but something that would just end this monotony in the food choices we have (or rather I have) in this city..\n\nI know some of you would say there is BOTS ( Love the food there), Ghaffar, Log Inn Lounge(Chapli Kebabs are awesome) and so on.. But really need some innovation something new and that can actually get someone hooked on to the place.. \n\nA few years ago there was this little cafe at Karsaz called Alao.. It used to have a great sandwich and very very good cold coffee.. It was a very quiet place yet I have not been able to find the same taste since it closed down..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-13T19:55:12+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-14T07:32:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002623239897","name":"Ezzy Irfan Izhar"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE2NTgyNjY2","before":"MTAwMDAyNjIzMjM5ODk3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"649509475100206","from":{"name":"Vishal Preetam","id":"1781512632"},"message":"burns road (Y)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-13T20:35:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"649513738433113","from":{"name":"Ammar Habib Khan","id":"685505866"},"message":"Rowtisserie.

It?s a sophisticated fine dining restaurant. The set-up is ?bistro style? and offers nice extensive menu. Ordered Mushroom Chicken, Chicken Cheese Burger, Fettuccine Pasta. Served within 15-20 minutes. The food was amazing and done with perfection. For Ambiance, some may find it cramped, I found it cozy albeit a little dark. Decor is fresh, sparkling clean white table cloths, indoor, outdoor both. The weather was pleasant so we chose to sat outside. Loved the green plantation with the dim lights in it. Nice addition to Karachi dining. \n\nMonte Cristo is doing great and gets 9/10 :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-04T11:58:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-04T13:54:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"500883930","name":"Saira Inam"},{"id":"708140643","name":"Fauzia Hanif H"},{"id":"666266173","name":"Nadya Omer"},{"id":"1183115625","name":"Adil Ahmad"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"502229090","name":"Fatima Hossain"},{"id":"780560073","name":"Anita Zeeshan Al-Najjar"},{"id":"717903318","name":"Navira Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE3OTAzMzE4","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"644871348897352","from":{"name":"Navira Khan","id":"717903318"},"message":"hi zartashia, can u plz tell me the total amount u paid there? i m planning to go there...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T12:11:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644872052230615","from":{"name":"Najia Farhan","id":"1576656836"},"message":"R kids allowed there?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T12:14:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644873762230444","from":{"name":"Fatima Hossain","id":"502229090"},"message":"Loved the ambiance but the burger is definitely better at roasters:) since it's owned by the same person!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T12:19:28+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644889105562243","from":{"name":"Zartashia Malik","id":"758741881"},"message":"We were five ppl and everyone has ordered an individual food. without drinks it has costed us Rs.4,800.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T12:53:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644892048895282","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"Burgers at fine dining restaurants?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T13:04:12+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644896672228153","from":{"name":"Abbas Jafri","id":"510967457"},"message":"Zartashia Malik I don't count as I was sick I only had tea hence 4 people :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T13:19:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"758741881","name":"Zartashia Malik","type":"user","offset":0,"length":15}]},{"id":"644899158894571","from":{"name":"Fatima Hossain","id":"502229090"},"message":"It's a steakhouse hence char grilled burgers","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T13:27:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644908955560258","from":{"name":"Ali Raza Pir","id":"515674780"},"message":"It sucks","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T13:52:02+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644909555560198","from":{"name":"Miriam Arsalan","id":"610671062"},"message":"I saw baby high chairs so kids r allowed","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-04T13:54:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"644909598893527","from":{"name":"Ali Raza Pir","id":"515674780"},"message":"I have zero confidence in Arizona/Roasters/Monte Cristo management.

I think from now on I'll stick to the routine orders there.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-10-14T08:28:10+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-14T11:02:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1101865045","name":"Asma Bhatti"},{"id":"579933313","name":"Ali Daudpota"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"594796590","name":"Ufaq Ashfaque"},{"id":"723750302","name":"Saad Ali"},{"id":"549655574","name":"Nazish Huda"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"100000674735601","name":"Muhammad Patel"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"100002154180249","name":"Afifa J Maniar"},{"id":"625571272","name":"Fahad Hanif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI1NTcxMjcy","before":"MTEwMTg2NTA0NQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"633723043345516","from":{"name":"Fahad Hanif","id":"625571272"},"message":"absolutely","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-14T08:30:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"633723076678846","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Routine order....1 large premium latte with an extra shot of espresso no froth, smoked salmon bagel or walnut tart.

I thought of writing a review that day but then I thought it may be a one time thing. This time after waiting for 10 minutes we decided to do the same thing after which they told us to sit again and eventually got the bill. \n\nWe asked for water as soon as we got there. They made us wait a decent amount of time after which the waiter got water with only two glasses while we were four people. My friend complained but he never got more glasses. \n\nWhile I am at it one more thing I don't like about that place is, after paying so much I don't like them serving drinks in Buddy packs. The cans really aren't that expensive.\n\nWith all this said I still love their food I really wish they would improve the quality of their service.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-23T17:43:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-23T22:09:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1073623180","name":"Shamama Faisal Khan"},{"id":"726085463","name":"Zohaib Hasan"},{"id":"1088748635","name":"Aqsa Shah"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"100003698171140","name":"Asra Mushtaq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAzNjk4MTcxMTQw","before":"MTA3MzYyMzE4MA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"623389771045510","from":{"name":"Asra Mushtaq","id":"100003698171140"},"message":"Agreed.

Also the french fries were crunchy and complimented the meals, the baked potato on the other hand was totally overcooked to the point of resembling a mash!

The number of dishes they are offering are very less and you can in a way ignore that fact if they tasted good-Spring rolls were STALE. The quality has gone done and so has the service. I asked for ketchup on my table and the waiter went like \"Wahan jahan buffet hai wahan parhi tou hai.\" I was like there is no harm if i am asking for it on my table as i didnt spot it there. I got the same response when i asked for an extra fork while having food. Above all, the pamphlet on my table said it is rs 799 including tax and when the bill came they had charged extra tax saying madam we have changed the deal claiming that the pamphlet is old. Also, they had charged a good amount of Rs 300 as service charges (what kind of service are they providing when they cant get me ketchup or extra cutlery on my table.) The story doesnt end here, apparently they also charged for an extra lemonade whereas it was part of the deal and we didnt order any extra lemonade. Anyway the management apologized but the whole point is when you go out you want to have a good time not to deal with different sort of hassles. Frankly I wont recommend it.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-14T20:12:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-15T08:12:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"746190586","name":"Hussain M Raza"},{"id":"516078000","name":"Faizan Parvez Qureshi"},{"id":"590580117","name":"Syed Kumail"},{"id":"1541540918","name":"Hassan Ahmed"},{"id":"589563741","name":"M Junaid Chinoy"},{"id":"1360214898","name":"Samia Mohsin"},{"id":"723835542","name":"Fariha Aamir Khan"},{"id":"684695118","name":"Abdullah Qadir"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"100002255525455","name":"Jiya Haq"},{"id":"657076417","name":"Mahnoor Iftikhar"},{"id":"583842627","name":"Harry Hardeep"},{"id":"100002989785243","name":"Mareah M.

But, this time I went with my mother. Now, I've tried their Chapli Kebabs, Nihari and all the Heaven/ Hell burgers, which is the good stuff, so I wanted something different. Anyway, here's my review:\n\nMind you, I've had amazing experiences before of this place. Nobody came to take the order, so I had to make a shout to the waiter to do so. -__- Then, as we were sitting, I just took the lid off the sugar pot, and out poured a gazillion ants. I didn't create a fuss or anything, and since I didn't take my phone, there are no pictures. However, the guy took the pot away and cleaned it up. \n\nMom ordered Fish and Chips, and I, bereft of choice, went for the Rooster Steak, which I was informed was the larger version of the Chic Steak. Didn't get the espresso shots. We also ordered fries. The first set of fries came earlier than the meal, and they were fine. Mom really liked her fish and chips too. But, the steak was a real disappointment. Being a steak lover, I was hoping for the same level or at least close to what we get at Roasters or Flo. Sadly, for the upsized version which was served on a humongous platter, I got two very thinly cut strips of chicken, with a dip that was just way too much compared to the 'steak'. The price? Same as what you'd pay at Roasters for a good steak (Wild Mushroom/ Monterrey Chicken). I fail to visualize the size of the smaller one. Then, midway through the meal, I ordered more fries, which came very late. We had long finished the meal, and since there wasn't a sign of the fries, I called the guy. He said 'fries mei hi subse ziada dair lagti hai', which was really confusing. Anyway, they arrived twenty minutes after the meal had finished and nobody was in the mood to eat by then. \n\nSo, in a gist, the fries were great, the fish and chips were great, but steaks aren't their strongest suit. Serving times were tremendously slow this night. And, nobody likes being greeted by ants the minute you sit down on a table. And, that's all. I hope Quddusi Sahab takes notice and they improve their standards, without letting complacency become a factor. Cheers, y'all.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-10T18:42:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-10T19:17:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"671250001","name":"Noman Iqbal"},{"id":"100000420764459","name":"Sana Shakir"},{"id":"604074782","name":"Farheen Jeelani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA0MDc0Nzgy","before":"NjcxMjUwMDAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"583393721711782","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"noted with concern, both issues will be sorted out tomorrow, really sorry to read, i was around but pre occupied for tomorrow, will get back to you, plz apologies to yr mother from my side","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-10T19:14:46+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"583394268378394","from":{"name":"Najm Ahmed","id":"885480695"},"message":"Yes, I saw you behind the counter.
