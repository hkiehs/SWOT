Unfortunately, the good part almost ends here.. the turkey jalapeno pizza was served on a thin crust which suited us all just fine except for the topping didn't go down too well.. it was a bit bland for our liking. the Cajun Jambalaya was a huge disappointment, as one of the friends mentioned, it seemed like a desi version of regular pasta and the spice mix tasted almost like ghar ka salan, with coriander powder and chili flakes.. while the pasta was smeared in spice mix, the shrimps on the side were almost bland and not something we'd want served in a restaurant.. \nthe most commendable part of the evening however was when the owner paid a random visit at our table to get our feedback and when informed of our experience with the jambalaya, he admitted of receiving mixed reviews, graciously accepted the criticism with a smile, apologized instead of taking offence and offered us a serving each of two best seller desserts, on the house! a gesture very well appreciated by us all.. \nthe chocolate tart that he personally recommended was a tad bitter, he warned us before hand, but then most of us liked it just the way it was! the red velvet cheesecake was just about ok.. the cheese part was yummilicious however we found the crust to be way too hard. like he said, the choco tart is a definitely a must try at Pantry, so much so that a friend in the group proclaims to have gone off the cheesecakes in favor of those chocolate tarts! :-)\nwe wish the management all the best in keeping up their good food standards, the hygiene and well lit ambiance and hope they will overcome the minute glitches in no time..... hope to return back to the place soon!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-24T20:26:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-27T07:05:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575802952","name":"Ayesha Farooqi"},{"id":"764425006","name":"Alisa Zulfiqar Zuberi"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"1120122270","name":"Shehla Khurram"},{"id":"633230637","name":"Mahnaz Hadi"},{"id":"512577683","name":"Salik Sajid"},{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"100000125904027","name":"Samad Tariq"},{"id":"100004102427163","name":"Malyha Shuja"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"709896077","name":"Asma Asghar"},{"id":"1488375731","name":"Salim Khoonjee"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"785615314","name":"Maleeha Jawaid"},{"id":"100000554344923","name":"Salman Khan Nizari"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEyMDkxMjYx","before":"NTc1ODAyOTUy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"561593153891839","from":{"name":"Maleeha Jawaid","id":"785615314"},"message":"Oh wow.

Flo to make a reservation for my wife and myself for Valentine?s Day dinner for 9.00pm. The gentleman on the phone said we only have two slots available; 8.00pm and 10.00pm. I confirmed for the 10.00pm slot. He said we will make the temporary reservation but booking will be confirmed once Rs. 3,000 has been paid in advance. I was like fine I will make the payment next week. Today I went to make the payment via my card but they said reservation is to be made by cash payment only and also informed me that only cash payments will be accepted on the day of the dinner. I was like this should have been communicated to me via phone when I was making the reservation or it should be mentioned somewhere (where ever you advertise your deals like karachisnob.com). Eventually I just decided to leave!\nCorrect me if I am wrong but wasn't Flo being cheap? I understand they were trying to get their confirmations by receiving advances from the customers but then at least mode of payment should have been kept flexible! Who carries cash in this day and age! They should bring it to the customer?s knowledge at least. I have always had a great experience at Flo but this incident left me utterly disappointed. Lesson to all the restaurant owners: PLEASE MAKE ALL SORT OF COMMUNICATION TO THE CUSTOMERS (BE IT RELATED TO DEALS, PAYMENT ETC.) VERY CRISP AND CLEAR.

I used to be an enthusiast for Gun Smoke burgers and steaks, my personal favourite was the Blue cheese burger (but somehow it doesn't really go with the Pakistani taste palette and I was always worried that they will knock it off the menu). Then i heard that they are closing down their Zamzama spot to open at Dolmen mall (I did not agree but did I have a choice? No) so moving on I bump into their new location whilst a stroll in the mall with my family and we decided to have food there. I was surprised to see the menu, no blue cheese, that's not all. ALL burgers and ALL steaks now come with four standard sauces/ choices (pretty bad ones). To top that, the burgers have one awfully small, dry and terribly tasteless, from succulent, juicy and mouthwatering, this is quite a downer I tell you! What they have done is that they have gone the way of the masses, industrious burgers, slightly cheaper price tags and standardised taste. Fine if it works for you but I am sure it doesn't for all the customers you carefully cultivated over the years, for me, Gunsmoke is dead!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-20T19:44:21+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-21T19:58:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"517047385","name":"Amber Zuberi Esbhani"},{"id":"100002928478909","name":"Rabia Ahmed"},{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"509507958","name":"Omair Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5NTA3OTU4","before":"NTE3MDQ3Mzg1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"401204563264033","from":{"name":"Sarah Ashraf","id":"643405172"},"message":"eeep, how disappointing that they have become standardized,  I quite liked their original idea and product .","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T20:24:37+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401233199927836","from":{"name":"Sarah J.K","id":"708025491"},"message":"this is depressing","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T21:21:20+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401499216567901","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":":(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-21T08:55:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401508499900306","from":{"name":"Syed Adeel Ahmed","id":"635540096"},"message":"looks like all the capital went in procuring uncessary hoo haa and expensive equipment.

How Long?? Dont know!!!Stood there for 10 minutes outside and and then left and had lunch at Butlers. the Thai couple kept asking and got the same treatment. Plesae wait outside. Not alowed to go in the restaurant. Fantastic first impression. Why bother to open and announce when you cannot manage more than 8 people at a time.

I?ve been crazy busy with work the entire week.\n\nSo here is my list of top 10 eateries in Karachi :)\n\n1. The Upper Crust. Don?t think I need to go into the details here. Everything is sheer perfection. \n\n2. Koel Caf? ? When in doubt, just land your tushie at Koel and you will always enjoy phenomenal food, lovely ambience and very courteous service \u003c3\n\n3. BOTS ? again, no need to go into details, for obvious reasons, lol! Delicious food, great delivery service and an absolutely delightful host.\n\n4. Log Inn Lounge ? serves one of the best burgers in town, service is fabulous and the host is a wonderful person. Which is an added bonus for the place that is already doing so well on its food :)\n\nThese are my top 4. Rest of the 6 are fabulous places but I?m only going to list them as I don?t really want to rate them on the top 10 in any particular order. They are all wonderful places that serve great food with impeccable service.\n\n? Olivetto ? love the ambience, love the food even more.\n\n? Grilled Chilliz ? delicious food and great value for money.\n\n? Snack Attack ? a gem not known to many people on this group, in bahadurabad area. They make the best mushroom burgers in town! \n\n? Pizzo ? reviving the concept of great pizzas delivered at home. After the great fiasco that pizza hut has been for many years and domino?s being a huge disappointment, pizzo is like a breath of fresh air.\n\n? Golden Dragon Chinese ? don?t need to say much for them. I think this would be enough: I?ve never been a fan of Chinese food. But GD has totally won me over! \u003c3\n\n? Zahid Nihari, Tariq Road ? deeeeliisshh!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-17T17:16:15+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-19T06:34:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100003034652779","name":"Saher Mukhtar"},{"id":"543405800","name":"Tahir Wahid"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"708482342","name":"Saba Basit"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzA4NDgyMzQy","before":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"399454210105735","from":{"name":"Bilal Alvi","id":"641495625"},"message":"a special mention for Gun Smoke.... the new one is better than the old one \u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T17:17:16+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399463893438100","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"have you tried gbc ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T17:39:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399464043438085","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"and saba do you have a facebook page ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T17:40:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399471693437320","from":{"name":"Mohammad Bin Zia","id":"1137915284"},"message":"Gauher Hashim Please check your inbox.

The best thing about Gunsmoke was even though it is located in a mall, in no way it gave one the feeling... It is an entity on its own... Overall a brilliant experience, Thank You AC :)\n\np.s: AC's burger in the french 'baguette like bun' was a totally different ball game :) would recommend it highly to people who want to be adventurous with their burgers :) (I Know I would next time that I am there)\n***********************************************************\nAmbareen Khan\nDear fellow swotties..I was on the table next to yours during the Gun Smoke food tasting today. Must say I agree in most part with your reviews. However there were some issues I pointed out. Firstly the cheese nachos were too 'processed' for my taste. They were simply spicy doritos covered in canned cheese dip and salsa. I was told that corn chips were not available locally(??) and therefore they had to stick to doritos. Secondly all of us ordered our burgers with the orginal bun which I feel does not do the juicy burger justice. Again I was told that Dawn is the only option so choice is limited. Salads, a few of them like the eggplant tomato was outstanding, wheras the pasta salad lacked oomph. However would I go again? Most certainly because I feel Gun Smoke will be ironing out minor glitches in no time and will live up to expectations set in part ,but obviously not solely,by its amazing ambience...\n***********************************************************\nAdnaan Chaudhary\nGun Smoke. Perfect wings. Grilled to perfection. The grilled prawn cocktail is divine. The burger in the french baguette bun was awesome. Head grill master personally delivered. Soup was great. Salad bar needs tweaking. Service still rough around the edges. But for day one it was miles ahead of any newbie joint. Prices equate value for money. Harris and kamran sheikh. Your Genesis is standing proud and tall. Bravissimo.\n***********************************************************\nNezihe Hussain\nWhat a day. Strike, heat, humidity all combined couldnt take away the wonderful time spent with fellow swotties....lovers of food. Many a noble bovine race sacrificed their lives for todays gastronomy of protiens.\n\nAt the SWOT Opening (soft) for GUNSMOKES latest venture at Dolmen Mall Clifton, met up to sample their menu and service.\n\nThe place has a fun feel. Perfectly chilled in this weather it was a pleasure to walk into the vibrant alive place.\n\nGun Smoke is synonymous with \"hutke\" \"something different\" and they have lived up to their promise.\n\nThe food thu limitedmin option today since it was a soft opening was really good. The burgers amazing. But i resent the favoritism being shown to lumboo when he got the french baguette bun and i got the regular soft bun.\n\nThe wings thu grilled and not crispy (as i like it) were cooked to perfection and yum. The nachos on the other had were doritos (not nice) the grilled prawns on a stick were perfection and i think even the BOTS spy got some tips.\n\nA place to head to on a hot Karachi summer or just for a bite of something yum. Guns are surely Smoking this time.\n\nWell done Kamran Sheikh and team.\n\nThank you Adnaan Chaudhary for arranging the lunch.\n***********************************************************\nShaikh Fawad\nGuess u guys heard Huh??? Yeah we went to Gun Smoke's- DollmenCity soft VIP opening courtesy AC. Felt a bit superstarish walking in as a line of envious eyes watched in jealousy? or may be in just hunger, as it was Lunch time, and the smell of a burger grill may have been more of a reason for wide&wild-open-eyes than the long list of SWOT celebrities : P.... anyWho, here are the dirty details:\nMuniza and I started w/ the soup and salad. Thought the flavors of the fresh&gr8 ingredients would have been enhanced if more seasoning was applied, but a dash of salt did the trick there:)\nNachos: I really didn?t think that classic Doritos could make such gr8 Nacho?s?talk about authentic : P ? wings were gr8 & perfectly succulent but I prefer both crispy on the outside & succulent on the LogINN,) side.\nBurger: I had the Mushroom Cheese, which was awesome!!! I could tell the cooking- time was something they take into consideration, as I had a perfectly cooked patty that was soft to bite in to : ))))))))))))))))) Muniza had the Pesto Burger & from what she told me it was also excellent :)\nI personally like thick home fries, but the perfectly crispy, skinny ones offered were piping hot, and only needed a dash of salt too make it deliciously savory.\nI thought the falsay drink was fantastic, so was the mint drink, but the former won my heart, as it wasn?t too sugary yet tasted natural and very refreshing!!!\nAll?n all, a gr8 opening!!! congrats Harris, and Kamran on yet another franchise : )\n***********************************************************\nHussain Tariq\nWent on the soft opening of Gun and Smoke on the invitation of Adnaan Chaudhary - Found the place extremely welcoming and lively!! of course had the company of amazing swotties Nezihe Hussain, Shaikh Fawad his lovely wife, Ally Aadil Bhamani Ryeaan Anwar Chaudhary Luciferz Angel and many many more... since it was a soft launch so few hiccups were expected but service was perfectly fine!! Tried a spoon full of doritos in Jalapeno dip (guess they were not served as Nachos) the dip / dressing was spicy and nice..wings were nice crispy and had amazing spicy tinge to them...and for the main course had a Jalapeno burger - the meat was perfectly char grilled and burger was good though bit crumby from the top but like always I remove the soggy part the one that has extra cheese and sauce and have my patty with the top part because it is always crispier so ended up enjoying my burger a lot! The mint lemonade was little over sweet but perfect, perhaps that is how it should be if not specified otherwise! My son would be a regular there because he is a huge burger fan!! The best part about the place is its location though its part of the mall and yet its away from the madding crowd..so one does not feel that he is sitting in a mall with crowd staring at you from everywhere!! All in all a very good experience!!\n***********************************************************","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T16:27:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-14T10:19:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"711705428","name":"Basit Nasir Ahmed"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"643423090","name":"Junaid Zuberi"},{"id":"592813967","name":"Umme Hamdani"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcwMTAwMTk4","before":"MTAwMDAyOTY3NTA0MTU5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397349016982921","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Luciferz Angel Ambareen Khan Nezihe Hussain Adnaan Chaudhary Hussain Tariq Shaikh Fawad Najam Quddusi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T16:31:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14},{"id":"676177213","name":"Ambareen Khan","type":"user","offset":15,"length":13},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain","type":"user","offset":29,"length":14},{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","type":"user","offset":44,"length":16},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq","type":"user","offset":61,"length":13},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi","type":"user","offset":88,"length":13}]},{"id":"397349063649583","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"thanks","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T16:31:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"397352813649208","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Raheel.

Must say I agree in most part with your reviews. However there were some issues I pointed out. Firstly the cheese nachos were too 'processed' for my taste. They were simply spicy doritos covered in canned cheese dip and salsa. I was told that corn chips were not available locally(??) and therefore they had to stick to doritos. Secondly all of us ordered our burgers with the orginal bun which I feel does not do the juicy burger justice. Again I was told that Dawn is the only option so choice is limited. Salads, a few of them like the eggplant tomato was outstanding, wheras the pasta salad lacked oomph. However would I go again? Most certainly because I feel Gun Smoke will be ironing out minor glitches in no time and will live up to expectations set in part ,but obviously not solely,by its amazing ambience...","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T15:24:33+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-13T21:52:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"508277151","name":"Omar Omari"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397325390318617","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Ambareen Khan - hey you should have told us - wow - so there were more SWOTTIES at the SWOT opening\n\ni totally agree - the doritos were a big disappointment  and must be worked on. the salad bar thu limited was good and fresh, the sauces a little thin for my taste but for a huge 150 person seater buffet i guess it ok. the rice was under cooked and the corn was hard. \n\neven thu everyone loved their soup - i found it too acid and there was no roasted flavor, \n\nbut other than these minor glitches - which believe me many wont notice - Gun Smoke is set up a new standard in diner food","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T15:34:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"676177213","name":"Ambareen Khan","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"397497386968084","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"yea chupkay say aati hain, aik dafa deekhti hain, aur khaosh rehti hain.

Thought the flavors of the fresh&gr8 ingredients would have been enhanced if more seasoning was applied, but a dash of salt did the trick there:)\nNachos: I really didn?t think that classic Doritos could make such gr8 Nacho?s?talk about authentic : P ? wings were gr8 & perfectly succulent but I prefer both crispy on the outside & succulent on the LogINN,) side.  \nBurger: I had the Mushroom Cheese, which was awesome!!! I could tell the cooking- time was something they take into consideration, as I had a perfectly cooked patty that was soft to bite in to : ))))))))))))))))) Muniza had the Pesto Burger & from what she told me it was also excellent :) \nI personally like thick home fries, but the perfectly crispy, skinny ones offered were piping hot, and only needed a dash of salt too make it deliciously savory.  \nI thought the falsay drink was fantastic, so was the mint drink, but the former won my heart, as it wasn?t too sugary yet tasted natural and very refreshing!!!\nAll?n all, a gr8 opening!!! congrats Harris, and Kamran on yet another franchise : )","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T13:59:36+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-13T13:59:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"647220220","name":"Anum Javed Qureshi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ3MjIwMjIw","before":"MTAwMDAzNjgxNDkzODIy"}}},"restaurantName":"Gun Smoke"},{"id":"165861103465048_397225310328625","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Went on the soft opening of Gun and Smoke on the invitation of Adnaan Chaudhary - Found the place extremely welcoming and lively!! of course had the company of amazing swotties Nezihe Hussain, Shaikh Fawad his lovely wife, Ally Aadil Bhamani Ryeaan Anwar Chaudhary Luciferz Angel and many many more... since it was a soft launch so few hiccups were expected but service was perfectly fine!! Tried a spoon full of doritos in Jalapeno dip (guess they were not served as Nachos) the dip / dressing was spicy and nice..wings were nice crispy and had amazing spicy tinge to them...and for the main course had a Jalapeno burger - the meat was perfectly char grilled and burger was good though bit crumby from the top but like always I remove the soggy part the one that has extra cheese and sauce and have my patty with the top part because it is always crispier so ended up enjoying my burger a lot! The mint lemonade was little over sweet but perfect, perhaps that is how it should be if not specified otherwise! My son would be a regular there because he is a huge burger fan!!

There was an excessive use of sauces and mayo in the burgers that the patty kept slipping out of the buns.  The buns were, however, very fresh and soft.   The only item worth mentioning are the chicken tenders which were served fresh with a sauce which had an amazing flavour.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T19:10:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-07T13:17:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"555701439","name":"Raamish Zaidi Irani"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"669795452","name":"Haseeb Akhtar"},{"id":"726690443","name":"Danial Rizvi"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"561399662","name":"M Azwerul Haque"},{"id":"620275602","name":"Maria Jaffar"},{"id":"510835801","name":"Nudrrat Khawaja"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"},{"id":"100003784320529","name":"Shahzad Saeed"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"100000391823197","name":"Farah S.
