Packed. And the same situation at Okra too. So, decided to go to Pantry as I have been hearing good things about it. They were able to seat us fortunately. Love how the place looks so bright during the day time. Since me and my friend were not very hungry, I ended up ordering, at the waiter's recommendation, a Chicken Acapulco sandwich while my friend ordered the Mushroom Mac and Cheese. I have never really like macaroni so the mac and cheese held no charm for me. I took a bite but as I said I have never been to keen on it, so for me it was quite meh. My guest was however pleased with her lunch. \n\nHaving said that, the sandwich very quite good. The bread is apparently baked in house and it is excellent. When ordering the sandwich, I was offered several choice of bread but I went with the plain one, which was excellent. Overall a good meal. Will probably go there again for dinner one of these days.\n\nLocation in the lane of Espresso Zamzama and Okra.\n\nExpect to pay about 1000-1500 a head.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-29T14:58:27+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-30T15:38:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1033177887","name":"Zainab Zeeshan Monnoo"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"622624323","name":"Mansoor Teli"},{"id":"100000434598020","name":"Sarah Atif"},{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"823205690","name":"Muhammad Umer Gill"},{"id":"690952546","name":"Shuja Muhammad"},{"id":"691430365","name":"Muhammad Ali Teli"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"1377186173","name":"Owais Mahmood"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"508776548","name":"Meher Saigol"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"1272243315","name":"Ambreen Shekhani"},{"id":"651643760","name":"Jasrah Mubarak"},{"id":"1471668943","name":"Aman Shaikh"},{"id":"805195531","name":"Amna Shah"},{"id":"100002154180249","name":"Afifa J Maniar"},{"id":"1277228905","name":"Rehan Ahmad Khan"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"100001773575512","name":"Little Chef"},{"id":"658210647","name":"Sania Saeed"},{"id":"724121365","name":"Rida Mansoor Teli"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4","before":"MTAzMzE3Nzg4Nw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"674220442629109","from":{"name":"Tehreem Fatima","id":"892195391"},"message":"u mean espresso zamzama! not shahbaz","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T15:04:09+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674220689295751","from":{"name":"Faisal Naseer","id":"780902784"},"message":"Yes I did Tehreem.

My dad is on a wheelchair but hates being wheeled or helped up stairs or whatever. He cannot stand or move from chair to chair and HATES it when people have to help him around/pick up his chair etc.\nWheelchair friendly doesn't mean having an elevator, or providing a wheelchair (we carry one in the car), wheelchair friendly means the person should go around freely, independently, like we do, Alhumdulillah.\n\n3) Dolmen Mall is NOT wheelchair compatible. My dad drives. Once in the parking lot, there are no elevators. What ridiculous planning is this? The escalators are not built for someone on a wheelchair.\n\n4) Port Grand is also not wheelchair friendly. It has these ridiculous separations/gaps and weird stones in the middle of the plain ground. THAT isn't wheel chair compatible.\n\n5) All the ramps available at a thousand restaurants aren't really useful. There's supposed to be a proper angle where the person on the wheelchair doesn't fly off if left unattended. \n\n6) Why don't people think of these things when investing in huge projects like Dolmen Mall?

Yes the waiters were very helpful In that they scooted over the tables so that my mum could slide into one of the booths. However, there should be higher seating in the waiting area in addition to a ramp for wheelchair access (not sure if the extension has this facility).

Vehicles should be banned as well since they add to your environmental pollution and affect millions as compared to smoking. Same goes for the home appliances like Air conditioning fridge freezer.

The four of us ordered Goat Cheese & Fig Pizza, Parmesan Chicken, Caesar Salad and Old School Beef Cheese Burger along with 3 Lemontas and their Chocolate Brownie with Ice cream for dessert. \nThe pizza failed to impress me. True, it was light and baked to perfection but it lacked flavor and it kinda reminded me of homemade grilled cheese sandwiches. The burger was AHHMAZING! The Caesar Salad wasn't exactly great either, I know quite a few other places serving better version of this salad. The Parmesan Chicken however was delicious! Lemontas were, as always extremely refreshing and the chocolate brownie remains one of my favorite desserts in the city..Can't get enough of it really, it's a must try. \nAlso, the place desperately needs a UPS because while we were there, the electricity went and came at least 4-5 times. I guess that can be forgiven though considering the current state of the entire city when it comes to electricity issues. \nDespite a few minor flaws, there's just something about Xander's..Its always a pleasant experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-19T19:42:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-20T11:34:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"100004312209331","name":"Safi Hasan Rizvi"},{"id":"557711846","name":"Gulnar Kabraji"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"1795675310","name":"Maha Javed Chishty"},{"id":"501478359","name":"Mohammad Mikail Soomro"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"1460213785","name":"Hareem Kh"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1291671692","name":"Shehrbano Ibrahim"},{"id":"509209694","name":"Sheheryar Khan"},{"id":"100002850760185","name":"Nayab Ali"},{"id":"100003201386322","name":"Hera Ryaz"},{"id":"511368155","name":"Anam Amin"},{"id":"100001039943363","name":"Munawar M Shahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMDM5OTQzMzYz","before":"NTU3MzIxMjM2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"573599279357893","from":{"name":"Anam Amin","id":"511368155"},"message":"I agree with \"there's just something about Xander's\" that one finds their flaws forgivable.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:00:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573603826024105","from":{"name":"Moomal Shahab Channa","id":"512199353"},"message":"Thumbs up for the parmesan chicken at xanders","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:15:30+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573609312690223","from":{"name":"Sohaib Khan","id":"686900066"},"message":"I loved their mini burgers not sure what they called.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:36:59+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573610032690151","from":{"name":"Tehmina 'Manna' Khan","id":"549225127"},"message":"Oh yea those are awesome!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-19T20:39:54+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"573863509331470","from":{"name":"Sarah Qureshi","id":"1219353074"},"message":"We have had horrible experiences there.

Im assuming given the fortnight of shutdown everyone did want to try it out, plus a Saturday night and lets admit it, it is a place more often than not we all do enjoy a lot. \n\nTranslation: a 20 minute wait told upfront. It was made comfortable thanks to the lovely cane sofas outside Ensemble which was well complemented by pleasant breezy weather. Courteous and apologetic at the same time for the wait, really made the difference.\n\nWaiters attended well to orders and there was no wait. The entrepreneur was actually watching everything when not going to and fro checking on all tables. We didnt realise our food was taking time. We were reminded by his presence. Honestly i guess the world must be complaining so much because every table and every waiting guest was being checked on. \n\n Food: burgers am told were lovely. I tried them once before: they were good so am sure these were great as well. to quote one of our: \"best burger!\" . I gladly savoured the fries and iceberg+arugula they opted to ditch. \nPrawn on toast: among the place' star items on the menu and surely didnt fail to deliver again. \n\nChicken satay: i love their satay usually. i may have loved it today but erm the peanut butter was not offfset but sufficient fish sauce/ salt. though have to appreciate how very creamy it was and how succulent the chicken pieces were. plus the garlic rice: lovely. not overpowering at all. ample chilli flakes but not at all spicy. \nI did send the satay back for redoing with fish sauce cuz it was too sweet but it didnt come back to my liking. honestly: i cannot complain. The place has always served good food so once, with all the rush outside, it was alright. It also is a possibility they changed the recipe to make it a bit sweet and creamier and not salty. I cannot complain. but i honestly couldnt eat it. so brought it back home to be fixed at home. \n\nCaramel frappe was a delight as always. mildly sweet with the flavour of caramel and so creamy. followed by red velvet cupcakes: mmmmmmm.\n\nthe place is always such a pleasant experience. have always loved their food and decor but the attention today and the efficiency by the staff despite all the rush added to yet another good evening.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-11T20:42:32+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-12T10:36:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"423319967719159","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"forgot to mention the other aspect of Xander's which also left a mark: beef patties and prawns on the bread were all well covering the bread, instead of the gaps. you get a good whole fill of what your ordered. so much attention to detail.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T05:37:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423376751046814","from":{"name":"Fahad Humayun","id":"756755028"},"message":"I had an awful first experience there and I had decided not to go there again...but now maybe I will :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T10:32:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423377937713362","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"have read of a lot of bad experiences at Xander's  on SWOT and honestly AlHamdOLillah we've never had one. \n\nmore importantly each time having observed Alexander stand and monitor everything and keep checks on everything, it got a bit difficult for me, personally, to believe things could have been so bad for people without having a solution to a problem. \n\ni do suggest you go. hopefully you wont have a bad experience but in case you do, do tell them team or Alexander himself if he's there. things are attended to: again: from observation of each visit we've made there","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T10:36:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDIzMzc3OTM3NzEzMzYy","before":"NDIzMzE5OTY3NzE5MTU5"}}},"restaurantName":"Xander's"},{"id":"165861103465048_414307111953778","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"If u had an invitation for lunch with the following options Xander's, butlers @ dolmen, aylanto which one would u choose and why?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-18T21:26:16+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-19T12:36:07+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"414308028620353","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"xanders or aylanto.

Surely enough five minutes later we were seated inside and quickly placed the order.  We ordered three types of Pizza's to start with ? the margarita, pesto with anchovies, and the chicken and jalape?o.  Also for the starters we ordered the fried calamari with scallion and garlic plus the honey glazed wings.  Though the service was good on the whole I had to remind them three times in ten minutes to bring the water which was a tad bit irritating.  Apart from this little glitch service has vastly improved?.The pizza's arrived promptly?the first the margarita was good but not great, the same with the second the chicken jalape?o it was good but not something which one would say hit the spot.  The third the pesto with anchovies I will be bold enough to say flavor wise was the best pizza I have eaten in Karachi period.  I say flavor wise because the toppings were a perfect \"10\" but the base in all three pizza's was a bit limp I prefer my base to be a bit crispy so not to droop in half when picked up from the plate.  That said if they can quickly fix this easily addressable problem they will definitely give the Pompei pizza a run for its money!!!  The fried calamari and the honey glazed wings arrived next.  Both were excellent !!! The garlic and scallions were perfectly balanced with the fried calamari as not to over power the taste and this dish was truly a pleasure to eat and the wings were also simply brilliant.  For mains we ordered the jalape?o cheese burger, the sliders, scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, and penne pasta with chicken and alfredo sauce.  I didn't have the scrambled eggs but my friend who did said they were excellent.  The jalape?o cheese burger was good but not as great as the sliders ?especially the blue cheese one?..it was really super!!!  My daughter loved the penne pasta and said it is as good as any she has had ?? just as we had finished devouring are meal Sikander show up with a new dish he was sampling and asked if we would like to try it, we loved it but don't know if I should mention it as he is still working on it?.  He is really a passionate restauranteur who loves experimenting with new dishes and we are really lucky to have him in Karachi ?we can expect many new culinary delights from him in the years to come!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-20T17:07:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-20T17:07:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"100000374500079","name":"Misbah Nizami"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"1340157842","name":"Naheed Mashooqullah"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM0MDE1Nzg0Mg\u003d\u003d","before":"ODQ2NjY0NTM4"}}},"restaurantName":"Xander's"},{"id":"165861103465048_380497435334746","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"which pizza is the best?

Ordered the grilled chicken panini, espresso hot pizza and lasagne. All three dishes were satisfying. The lasagne deserves special mention as it had the right balance of white sauce and cheese which most places seem to miss out on. The panini and thin crust pizza were all right. Not mindblowingly good but acceptable. The watermelon juice was really refreshing. Loved it! The kiwi ice however, was a bit too concentrated. The double chocolate walnut brownie in the end was excellent!Loved the warm gooeey brownie. Sinfully delicious and second only to Xander's double chocolate. Service was prompt.

I wish the weather were slightly better so we could sit outdoors, because the kind of racket these two separate huge groups of people were making, simply ruined our experience of such a serene setting. \n\nComing to the food, since I just wanted a light snack, I ordered Wasabi Prawns, to be followed by Tiramisu, and my husband ordered a regular cappuccino and Chocolate Fudge Cake with Vanilla Ice cream. It was rather disappointing to see just four medium sized batter-fried prawns placed on each corner of a rectangular platter with romaine and iceberg lettuce in the middle. Not just that, there was barely a hint of wasabi sauce brushed on top of the prawns. Rs 595 + tax for such a dish is a bit too steep by all standards! All I could think of at that time was Xander's OVERLOADED prawn sandwich! (which by the way, was what we had set out to eat initially, but the place was jam-packed and so I had the brilliant (?) idea of checking out Aylanto.) \n\nThe desserts fortunately were a saving grace and a half. The fudge cake was moist and dense, however, the ice cream was crystallized and even though we sent it back, the replacement was no better. My tiramisu was divine.. subtle balance of flavours, light and creamy . The coffee flavour was not overpowering but still made its presence felt. That is something I could go back to Aylanto for.. But I'll give it some time first to learn from and act upon the customers' feedback. \n\nThe service was fine, the manager was apologetic about the noise and commotion. Outdoors would be lovely once the weather improves. I really want to go back to Aylanto, hope they up their game soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T09:30:41+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-06T09:30:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"711699788","name":"Sanaa Zubairi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzExNjk5Nzg4","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"restaurantName":"Xander's"},{"id":"165861103465048_372040692847087","from":{"name":"Omair Ahmed","id":"509507958"},"message":"Please name your top 10 best Pizza places in Karachi from 10 - 1","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-03T19:43:15+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-04T14:26:28+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"372045439513279","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"10.

The brownie was very fresh and tasted good, would've enjoyed it much more if it were bigger than a bite.. :/  The choco-mint cake was NOT mint.. it was a coffee cake slice and seemed to have originated from a low-quality bakery.

But obviously he can see the comments and posts. Due to the last post on Xander's he hhas every right to correct the maligning comments so he inboxed me.\n\nI have to admit he makes sense. And all my times at Xander's have been great. Even when I got a creme brulee that could have been better, their service was impeccable.\n\nPlease read the email.\n\"Hi Nezihe, since I'm no longer part of SWOT (i tried to comment to the pizza thing) i can't write back, which is fine. However i wanted to let you know what i was writing as even you seemed to believe what was written. This is nothing against you or SWOT since both have helped me for Xander's. So here it is...\n\nMany of you have not heard from me for a long time on this group...the reason for this is that although I am open to negative feedback (SWOT helped me determine that my food portions in the beginning were too small and helped me improve for example), i have heard even more \"ridiculous\" comments which i know are not true ranging from me the owner telling a customer off and bad-mouthing them because they had not ordered enough or were not willing to wait for a table (??!!) or my best and most trusted waiter throwing his pen and pad on the floor and storming off after arguing with a customer (CCTV footage shows that it never happened) etc etc. Unfortunately, my camera does not have a view of the pizza station, however, for those who wish to listen to me, i would like to say that these pizza's are being made on a trial basis and the 3 pizza's given to customers that day were sent under MY supervision, which means i was there throughout. I know, that my cook who has had experience working infront of guests before would never ever in his wildest dreams think of \"spitting\" on a pizza let alone \"blow\" on it before serving it. I may come across as arrogant by not believing a word of this, but i know that there's not even the slightest chance of that happening. Furthermore, how could a pizza that has caught fire and therefore charred and become black be served to a customer infront of the owner? This conversation can drag on, but i found it necessary to intercept this one time and explain. For those who don't believe me thats fine. I respect SWOT tremendously, for the constructive criticisms and feedbacks which help us restauranteurs improve our service and quality.

We settled on Xander's since a couple of people have recommended it and it has a courtyard where we could sit outside and the little one could putter around. As it turns out the courtyard was swarming with flies so that was a non-starter and we moved indoors. The decor was nice and the staff courteous and friendly. My daughter loved the Christmas Tree and got a complimentary chocolate which she scarfed down in no time. I was a little disappointed with the menu selection which seemed limited and at first I couldn't really find anything that took my fancy, however when a couple of plates of fish and chips wafted by for the neighbouring table, both my wife and I were tempted since it looked like genuine battered english-style fish and chips.\n\nThe service was swift, but as it turns out the fish was very poor. It just tasted off somehow (my wife claimed one of the pieces she got tasted fine so it may have been the fish was a bit old - I'm not sure) and the tartar sauce was also strangely sour - I'm not sure if that was because of something in it or it was also getting on in age. The quantity of the fish was nothing to write home about but since neither of us liked it that wasn't an issue. The fries were standard mon salwa type stuff and in good quantities. We regretted not getting different dishes, though as I said earlier I wasn't too impressed by the diversity of the selection. We unanimously decided to forgo desert at Xander's and go elsewhere instead (ended up going to Hotspot where the desert was great as usual but the experience slightly spoilt by a table-full of 14 year-old girls smoking like chimneys).\n\nBut as it turns out our troubles at Xander's weren't over. I paid by credit card but was told by the cashier that they were getting an error and it wasn't charged. So I paid in cash but then checked my phone to see I had received an sms from the credit card company saying it had been charged. I showed the msg to the staff who said I should ignore it since it hadnt been charged. I called the card people who confirmed it had been and informed the staff.

There is nothing wrong with that. \n\nSikander good to know you give your boys and staff a whole day off. And thank you for being so professional in your replies here.

However, i would like to add to Naheed Ghulamhussain's comment so that there are no misunderstandings. Your absolutely right that we had booked the interior on the 17th and 22nd, but that was because we had already taken the reservations approx 10 days prior (when Xanders was takings bookings), and even though we changed our policy afterwards, we wanted to be professional and honour the commitment that we had made, instead of abruptly cancelling the ladies lunch. That's the reason and nothing else.
