First on the list was Fish hot and sour soup (white) which was the appetizer followed by the Dhaka finger fish the all time favorite, Jumbo prawn tempura and then the legendary Leather Jacket fillet in green masala, Fish Behari boti a new entrant as i had not tried it before, Pangush Boti Karahi,Chicken Fried Rice, Kids meal Crispy Chicken Burger Zinger,Garlic Nan, cold drinks and mineral water.\n\nOK, now for the mixed reviews i had been reading about Bots, well yes its has changed, it has evolved for the better and now is a proper food street fine dining dhaba style restaurant :)\nLimca stall was their earlier, now their a doc juice shop, i don't know the name of the doc but its good,dai bara stall and a pan stall plus loud music playing so the ambiance was definitely lively and more festive.\n\nNow coming to the revision in prices, yes their has been an slight increase in cost due to 16% GST but they are GST registered and the GST/SNTN is S3966140-7 and my bill had an addition of Rs.500, but rest assured it is being deposited in the national exchequer 100% which is cumulatively a substantial amount.\n\nThe real increase in prices is not that much considering they are delivering on quality and quantity, the fish was fresh, juicy, well marinated and had great flavor, as good as in the past if not better. The chatnis and the lemon add to the flavor too.\nThe service was quick and the food was served piping hot. Only one dish that was the Pangush Boti Karahi lacked flavor and was quite bland, i think that needs to be worked on and can improve with some minor adjustments.\n\nLadies and gentlemen Bots is known as the best seafood Dhabba in Karachi and upgraded its position now to a \"food street fine dining dhaba style restaurant\"\nnot a bad deal considering that a similar meal at a fine dining seafood joint would cost you 60% more with the frills and fancies, but as far as I am concerned the core issue is the product, and as long as I get value for money in terms of quality and quantity I am a happy camper indeed and plan to return to Bots soon for another round of scrumptious sea food delicacies.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-03T22:13:06+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-05T06:30:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"100000674735601","name":"Muhammad Patel"},{"id":"1004056348","name":"Zaryab Shaikh"},{"id":"100001433820134","name":"Hasan Raza"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"1413795365","name":"Hiba Jamali"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"521735682","name":"Aamir Shahnawaz"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"593601228","name":"Muhammad Saifullah"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100000446704703","name":"Almas Mehmood"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"564100900","name":"Fawad Hai"},{"id":"645099594","name":"Mujahid Iqbal"},{"id":"100002698452985","name":"Rabia Mahmood"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjk4NDUyOTg1","before":"MTE5ODgzMTM3Ng\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"644634672254353","from":{"name":"Mahad Mustafa","id":"805150435"},"message":"Syed Zulfiqar Ali Kazmi!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-03T22:58:39+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"585210551","name":"Syed Zulfiqar Ali Kazmi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":23}]},{"id":"644851935565960","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Oh I see it now.

First went to Log Inn lounge for their famous burgers. We were informed by the waiter that he will be able to take our orders not before 25 min and then it will be additional 15-20in before he will be able to serve us. So we left from there and went to look for another restaurant in the same vicinity. Ended up at the sports bar in the basement of Kamamishi. The sports has been converted to cavaili lounge. It was a HORRIBLE experience. The place was gaudy and interior decorators nightmare. With red and purple lights and Cheetah print sofas it looked like a set from a B grade movie. Hunger made us stay and listen to kishore kumar weepy songs. We ordered corn soup, lemonatto drinks, beef tippenyaki, spicy chicken wrap and grilled chicken burger. Out of all the food the burger was eatable. Beef was cold and chewy. Wrap was dry. Soup was just starch. They served dinner when we threatened to leave after waiting for more then half an hour. We were taken a back when we got the bill for 4800 rs for 4 ppl.

I went out to Biryani of the Seas (BOTS) last Sunday and it actually turned to be a gastronomical disaster. I was extremely disappointed because while the food wasn't horrible, this place came highly recommended by family and friends, however the food they served was nothing to write home about. Here are the highlights :\n\n1)Prawn Biryani :- We started off with a prawn biryani which we assumed to be a house speciality. They biryani that was served was unusually cold, had a very subtle hint of masala and had all of 7-8 tiny prawns (yes, I counted). I completely understand if the lack of prawn was due to the breeding season but our server said nothing of this sort to us when we ordered.\n\n2) Tawa Chicken : Things simply went downhill after the biryani. The Tawa chicken incorporated two pieces of burnt chicken and the chicken was also overcooked on the inside. I was a little confused by this dish because having had tawa chicken in other places, I assumed that they would use boneless chicken instead of a breast and a leg piece. Additionally, While I appreciated the nice kick that the dish had, the rest of the table thought that the extra spice was simply trying to overcompensate for what the dish lacked.\n\n3) Leather jacket fillet : While the fish was perfectly cooked, I couldn't even detect a hint of flavour in it, not sure if the Tawa chicken had sabotaged my taste buds by this time but this dish felt oddly plain.\n\nOn a more positive note, the honey chilli prawns were satisfactory and the assorted chicken bbq made it worth our while to dine here but on the whole BOTS turned out to be a disappointing experience. I am not sure if I caught them during an off-night or if my expectations were too highly but BOTS failed to live up to hype for me.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-16T21:42:50+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-18T15:53:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"100002402711136","name":"Tazeen Hasan"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2","before":"MTAwMDAxODU4NDUwMDEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"399064373478052","from":{"name":"Khalid Ishaq","id":"680185313"},"message":"Quite a\nSimilar experience\nHad food poisoning after my first visit to BOTS n on d second trip ordered tawa chicken which was almost burnt","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T21:53:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399066506811172","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"To each his own....I eat BOTS 3 times a week...no problem so far","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T21:59:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399094416808381","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Looks like i spoke to soon about not getting complaints for a while on SWOTS :) - But Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
