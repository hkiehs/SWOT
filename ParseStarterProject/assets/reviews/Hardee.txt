It need not be a fine dining place..\n\nOver the last 2+ years all I have seen in Karachi are different trends.. One person dares challenge Pizza Hut with a new very different offering and it becomes a hit among us 'the foodies'.. Next few weeks we see the numerous pizza places open up.. some are good some are OK but after a few weeks they all taste the same.. Then came the thin crust era (No offence to anyone I totally love Domino's Thin Crust pizza)  and everyone from Domino's and bakeries and cafe selling the thin crust..\n\nWhile everyone was enjoying the 20 inches pizza, Hardees came to town.. There again began this trend of selling burgers.. And its still ongoing..Everyday there is a new place advertising themselves..\n\nIs there any place in Karachi that offers something other than burgers and pizza and pasta which tastes good too... I don't mind having sea food or steaks (No Arizona or Roasters pls) but something that would just end this monotony in the food choices we have (or rather I have) in this city..\n\nI know some of you would say there is BOTS ( Love the food there), Ghaffar, Log Inn Lounge(Chapli Kebabs are awesome) and so on.. But really need some innovation something new and that can actually get someone hooked on to the place.. \n\nA few years ago there was this little cafe at Karsaz called Alao..

I was still reeling from that traumatic experience when I read 2 weeks later that the Al-Baik outlet was NOT affiliated with the actual Al-Baik in Saudi .. I have a feeling I might be reading something similar about BK in the local Dawn a coupla weeks later .. \n\nTo elaborate the BK outlet was at seaview .. was on a high after watching Gravity in 3D and appreciating our world and everything in it .. walked in to find very few people which was heartening .. finally I'd get my favorite BK mushroom n swiss without having to wait 2 hrs in line & without having to drive 2 hrs to Hardees .. Whopper is not my favorite due to both the presence of ketchup & the similarity to Mcdees quarter pounder .. Juggled between shroom n swiss & the BK fish burger before deciding on the double mushroom n swiss (Rs. 560). Then the series of Debacles:\n\n1. Waiting time after order placement - Instead of the standard 5-6 min, waited for 15 min before requesting for delivery at the table.\n\n2. While waiting for the order saw the floor manager take a cup meant for customers, pour out some soda, drink it and put it back in the cup holder .. he left .. I rubbed my eyes; maybe the space movie from earlier had messed with my senses .. realized he really had done the unthinkable .. called him, confronted him about it, he denied initially then admitted his mistake, took the cup out of the holder and discarded it and went about his business without a 2nd thought.\n\n3. Ok maybe they're learning, lets cut them some slack, the double shroom'll put everything right, I thought ... till the burger actually came at my table .. folded in a whopper jr wrapper .. a tiny kid's burger .. Aah it's ok they messed up my order, gave me the whopper jr meant for the 6 yr old cutie at my adjacent table .. I told the server \"Ye barabar walon ka order hai, mera nahi\" .. \"Nahi sir ye apka order hai, double mushroom n swiss!\" .. \"Aik min, yaheen kharre rahe raho\" .. opened the wrapper to find a tiny sandwich that begged to be forgotten .. postmartemed it to find a slice of local cheese over a single slice of 'pasanda' with 5 tiny shrooms on top .. i say pasanda because this pattie was half as thin as Mcdees cheeseburger .. and that's pretty damn thin .. I asked for the restaurant manager; he came all serious-faced asking what's wrong .. I asked him if this was a double mushroom n swiss? He said \"Sorry sir, single mushroom n swiss hai yeh, mai abhi double karwata hoon issko\" ... I questioned the size of the burger, the thickness of the pattie, the presence of the local cheese instead of swiss cheese and 5 tiny mushrooms & he confirmed me that the double version had an extra pattie, that being the only difference .. I asked him how he could justify selling this local pasanda burger, that wouldn't fill up my toddler's tummy, for Rs. 560 and how he could live with himself trying to sell this off as a Burger King burger? From serious-faced to Ashen-faced. He mumbled something inaudible. I decided the mushroom n swiss was off the cards and I best change my order. \"Please get me 2 Fish Burgers & chicken nuggets instead. Maybe you'll redeem yourself then\". I rued not having taking a snap of the burger to dissuade all you good people thinking of visiting.\n\n4. Asked for 2 fish burgers because the price (Rs. 290) made me realize that would be tiny too. But little did I know that I'd get a microwaved burger containing a fried then 'poached' fish pattie .. yes poached! .. the photo attached will show you moist bubbles in the center of the fish with 2 wrinkly soft burnt bun halves! ... Horrible!!\n\n5. The nuggets, their last chance at redemption were drier than an arab's sandal! .. fried to the extent that all the goodness, all the juice had been squeezed out of the chicken.\n\nI walked out in disgust, without paying the extra charge for the nuggets or the burger difference. I exercised exceptional self-control not further berating Mr. Ashen-face like he deserved. Gordon Ramsay'd probably burnt the place down if he'd visited instead of me. \nI expect to visit the wikileaks page in a coupla weeks time to read that the Burger King outlets in Karachi are knock-offs of the real thing .. low quality imitations (not even!) of the real product.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-11-02T22:51:10+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-09T04:40:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1620471256","name":"Shahbaz Javed Khan"},{"id":"587291629","name":"Saad Muhammed Sheikh"},{"id":"514440277","name":"M?ri?

I ended up eating mine and snatching a few from the other meal.

I think it shrunk or something ..\nArgh ... I wanted to kill at that moment. Bless their lucky starts it was a takeaway.\n\n\nBurger King you are not even close to the international market.

So I guess we deserve this poison to be shoved down our throats. \n\nBut at least can they pretend to make an attempt to make it edible.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-12T02:18:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-13T17:53:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"594796590","name":"Ufaq Ashfaque"},{"id":"692511440","name":"Naila Wasti"},{"id":"571952596","name":"Shaarmeen Chughtai"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"644815164","name":"Ahsan Pervez"},{"id":"100002054881531","name":"Aamir Khan"},{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"574052713","name":"Harun Aziz"},{"id":"692390995","name":"Wahaj M Khan"},{"id":"100001434743152","name":"Raza Rehmani"},{"id":"698764443","name":"Shahnawaz Moti"},{"id":"745945065","name":"Shahjehan Maniar"},{"id":"100001829144476","name":"Faisal Noor"},{"id":"100003216046346","name":"Shezi Memon"},{"id":"549655574","name":"Nazish Huda"},{"id":"100003299348370","name":"Asad Memon"},{"id":"589563741","name":"M Junaid Chinoy"},{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"100002316753027","name":"Yas Minz"},{"id":"500778016","name":"Hammad Munir"},{"id":"549320513","name":"Momina Akber Rahim"},{"id":"734678626","name":"Rubaya Zia Khan"},{"id":"734228975","name":"Rizwan Mustafa Yusuf"},{"id":"769030393","name":"Muhammad Danniyal Jafri"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzY5MDMwMzkz","before":"NTk0Nzk2NTkw"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_632371256814028/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzY5MDMwMzkz"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"632410236810130","from":{"name":"Nadira Saeed","id":"620103062"},"message":"Personally I fail to understand what the excitement is all about anyway ?!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T02:41:04+0000","like_count":9,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632428826808271","from":{"name":"Talha Shahid","id":"668642026"},"message":"Too good !

Just the perfect place for a quick casual meal.\n\nOrdered the Flame Grilled Chicken, and that was bloody delicious.  It ensured that the chicken's sacrifice was not in vain.  The chicken was super flavorful, and every little square inch of the chicken had its own distinct flavor.  The chicken was juicy, and it never went dry.  The meal certainly did justice to its nomenclature.  The chicken was served with assortments that complemented the meal, and a fresh, soft, and fluffy pita.\n\nAlso ordered the Lightweight Chicken Shawarma, and that seemed to be a disaster.  The chicken was bland, dry, and tasteless.  The only saving grace was the pita, and hummus.  I would personally avoid the Shawarma next time around.  \n\nDefinitely becoming a regular at Rowtisserie for its Flame Grilled Chicken.  Hoping that they row across the Mediterranean, introduce Gyros, and just nail the flavor!\n\nRow all the way.\n\nOverall Rating -- 7/10 (mainly because of the Flame Grilled Chicken)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-22T20:27:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-24T16:30:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"724148371","name":"Rabia Hai"},{"id":"1590802896","name":"Farri Khalid"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"},{"id":"100006519972294","name":"Ali Raza Q"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"797675206","name":"Javeria Usmani"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Picked the burgers up from the 'shack', and had the 'Full House' with Loaded Fries.  The order was ready in like 15 minutes, despite a lot of demand.  They were easily churning out a dozen burgers every 5 minutes.\n\nThe succulent beef patty was probably the best I've had this side of the Suez, and is clearly a couple of notches better than the standard burgers served by fast food joints, including international franchises.  The bun-patt ratio was just perfect, and the buns were fresh.  The condiments were not overflowing, and complemented the overall taste.  And finally the price was pretty reasonable, relative to burgers served by fast food franchises.  Not much to write about fries -- they were just the usual fries, cut in a fancy way.  It will be great if they can provide a choice of burger buns as well!\n\nThe burger can't really compete with gourmet burgers, but its probably the best fast food burger out there, and definitely way better than the eagerly awaited Burger King, and the now mini-Mac of McDonalds.  Hardees is in a different league though, as the patty there is charbroiled. \n\nOverall, a good experience.  Would rate it at 8/10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-04T01:06:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-04T20:00:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"512577683","name":"Salik Sajid"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"810870516","name":"Talha Sufi"},{"id":"901860640","name":"Mohammad Rafil"},{"id":"557576643","name":"Shariq Riaz"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"1579891410","name":"Erum Siddiqui"},{"id":"712751198","name":"Zareen Sultan"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"547005284","name":"Adeel Azhar"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"593385155","name":"Mubashir Zuberi"},{"id":"828050472","name":"Maisam Ali"},{"id":"568465423","name":"Yasir Hasan"},{"id":"500172130","name":"Agha Hamza Pathan"},{"id":"544070599","name":"Farhan Saleem"},{"id":"1285044693","name":"Sami Ibrahim Tamimi"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"600961078","name":"Azzah Sharif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAwOTYxMDc4","before":"NTEyNTc3Njgz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"597862913598196","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"nice review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-04T03:02:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597868500264304","from":{"name":"Em Jay","id":"100000065623735"},"message":"Onion rings are much better than their ordinary fries","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-04T03:22:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597869446930876","from":{"name":"Adnan Yasin","id":"723675110"},"message":"Every burger chain has its own uniqueness except for those who are completely waste of money.\n\nThose who are good ...have at least one burger of different type.\n\nHARDEE'S ......

Before i proceed to the detailed version, a precise overview.\nPathetic food, pathetic customer services, pathetic attitude and rude behavior - Yes That is how it was.\nMy friend reached there around 6:25pm as 'instructed' by the Hardees ppl since they were not taking any reservations. As he entered, he called a guy to ask if there is any other table free then the one they were standing at. The guy looked at him, came near the table and then walked away to a distance and totally ignored him. However, we reached in a while and took the seats. Placed the order and in few minutes, there were burgers roaming around here and there and i was like 'Why so early?' - the burgers would be doomed by iftar as they would get cold and then to my utmost surprise - the burgers were on our table by 7:07pm which was 13 minutes before the Iftar and we were like :o - and as expected the burgers were weird by the time of iftar and so were the fries. I am not sure about others but my burger patty was undercooked as well or it seemed so after being lying there for a good time. The only thing which remained good was the onion rings. After we were somehow done with our burgers - were deciding to fill out the comment card, we asked for a fan from a service guy who said he is bringing in a while and never showed up :D and after sometime when a guy came to take stuff from our table, we asked him \"Pen milsakta hai\", he just slightly nodded his head and ignored the question which was asked again and left. My friend then walked up to the person looking after the floor to get the pen to fill out the comment card.\nEnd of the day, if it was not the company - at least i would have been doomed.

Its the best thing which could happen to Karachi far BETTER THAN Hardees with almost the same replica leaving the bun every thing is same ... I tried FATBOY burger with a 3 patty fillet ,  cheese, onions & jalapeno thou I had to open my mouth real wide to eat it the taste was AMAZING... the first punch you get is of the grilled patty and then followed by a rich taste of their sauce when combined you get a rich flavor to die for, and its followed by those lovely onions its just (*&$  Although the patty was a bit undercooked but the taste was still outstanding \nThe chips you have to eat as soon as you can I would rate their chips on a scale of 1 to 10 , 4 It is very sweet and not that crisp as it should be could have been better if its cooked for a little more time...\nMy home minster got the grilled chicken burger and I was in awe that I should have ordered that , very manageable and tasty  well cooked patty and good mix of sauce with onion tomato and cheese ... The chicken patty just feels right in your mouth its not hard nor soft and you enjoy your burger till you are chewing on your bite.. One thing to note when you go there is ensure you get a takeaway NOT eat there as the environment is hot and un bearable ..\nThe kiddo got himself a chicken grilled steak burger and then again I was hey kid leave me a bite alone LOL... I did not taste it but I know for a fact that my son enjoyed it alot because it's the only burger he finishes which I am sure is a sign he likes it.. \n I was lucky to enjoy it with my fav show at home with my family...  enjoyed their burgers like anything if you happen to be in the neighborhood towards Badhurabad its a MUST TRY!!!! I would any time have Sumy's burger than HARDEES due to its taste and being very reasonable in price...","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-03T06:23:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-04T18:05:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"673567501","name":"Haris Hassan"},{"id":"100002850760185","name":"Nayab Ali"},{"id":"657151302","name":"Nishat Mustafa"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"100004861441059","name":"Ifrah Hameed"},{"id":"502158910","name":"Mujtaba Karim"},{"id":"838135166","name":"Sadia Akbani"},{"id":"575820034","name":"Maheen Kamran"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTc1ODIwMDM0","before":"NjczNTY3NTAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"579845082066646","from":{"name":"Ahmed Affan","id":"509910007"},"message":"directions to Sumy's please.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-03T07:33:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579845888733232","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Karim","id":"502158910"},"message":"Hillside Bldg, Bahadurabad, Karachi, Pakistan-75400","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-03T07:36:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579846055399882","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Karim","id":"502158910"},"message":"Page https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sumys-broast-and-burgers/168816466494140","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-03T07:37:03+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579846175399870","from":{"name":"Ahmed Affan","id":"509910007"},"message":"thanks a lot Mujtaba \u003d)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-03T07:37:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"502158910","name":"Mujtaba","type":"user","offset":13,"length":7}]},{"id":"579851978732623","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Karim","id":"502158910"},"message":"Yeah man :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-03T07:50:48+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579853268732494","from":{"name":"Ifrah Hameed","id":"100004861441059"},"message":"Lol, home minister. \nBurhani sure gives you the de ja vu feeling.

The disappointing part was the main course apparently the thai chow mien means a spicier version of Chinese chow mien. Than the real disappointment I am sure almost anyone been to Ginsoy must have had the cherry chilli chicken so I ordered it in RE as well there was no gravy it was fried dry chicken and instead of canned cherries or fresh cherries they had used the sugary type of cherries that you use in cakes which gave the whole dish a very weird sweetish kick. \n\nService was also good something Teamginsoy Ginsoy needs to take a lesson from as when in rush hours the service is not upto the mark.\n\nPricing was also similar to Ginsoy you can have half portions as well but that makes me question if I want Chinese why not go to Ginsoy ?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-28T09:40:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-29T14:52:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d","before":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"577638808953940","from":{"name":"Sana Abdullah","id":"627747302"},"message":"For service and ambiance.

However we'd like to clarify a couple of things. Firstly we are not in the market to compete with Ginsoy. We have no comparison with Ginsoy as they're serving Extreme Chinese and we're serving Hakka Chinese. Hakka Chinese is a distinct cuisine of Chine which is acquainting the market, at the moment. The names may be similar to our competitors but we're solely striving for our identity and not being a substitute for other eateries. The prices have been set to what matches our costing and market, nor an 'at par' comparison with Ginsoy. There is nothing 'wannabe' about it if our ambiance depicts the name we've given to our eatery. We're serving food to please customers like you and that would remain our first and foremost priority.

Two queues with around 20 people in each queue.  Once the order is placed, it still takes anywhere between 15-25 minutes to serve.  Where they go wrong, excess staff in the cooking area and a mismatch in the cooking time versus the final preparation time.  Total damage - 6K for 6 persons.  Fatburger (beef) in 3 sizes, single, double and triple patty - pretty decent.  Jalape?o Chicken Burger - average plus and better than Hardee's.  They also have a turkey and a veggie option plus 3 options in chicken sandwich viz fried, crispy and grilled.  Also an option to have a double meat helping in chicken at extra cost. Complimentary BBQ sauce and extra jalape?os added to the burger.  Heinz Ketchup and 3 types of Tabasco.  Fat Fries - good and Onion Rings - initially served cold but then replaced.  Option to replace the fries with onion rings in the meal deals.  All meal deals Rs. 200 over and above the sandwich/burger prices.  Free refill of soft drinks/mango drink/ice tea.  Option to replace the soft drink with a milkshake by adding Rs. 190.

So good choice for using that service for delivery De Joe. The order was a couple of minutes late but excusable. Suggestion: Please improve the packaging to ensure that things dont get spoilt. The red velvet cake was all over the box because in that box, at least 20 of those pieces could fit whereas there were only 4 so this was bound to happen. The box for the burgers and the fries were perfect.\n\nThe good things about the deal: \n\nThe char broiled burgers are divine. My brother said that they tasted like mini bite-versions of a burger he had at Hardees. He did mean it as a compliment. There was nothing special about the Masala/Spicy fries. The Tex-Mex fries were yummy. The red velvet cake was the best RVC me and my family has had till date. Either the base is not moist, the frosting is too sweet, the base has an eggy smell or the frosting does not do justice to the base. But this RVC is a winner in all aspects. It is even better than Pane and Amore which was so far my fav place for RVC cupcakes. The Nutella cake is par brilliance. There is a thin layer of hazelnuts or walnuts which go crunch crunch in your mouth after mini-intervals. It is so delicious I wanted to cry out loud. \n\nThe bad things about the deal: \n\nThe fact that it is not a 4 person deal, or even a 3 or 2 person deal. \n\nSuggestion: \n\nPrice the deal at 500 bucks, replace the 1.5 litre with a 500 ml one and rename it as UC Iftar Deal. Another suggestion would be to let things the way they are and just increase the size of the cake. It is not actually a cake platter because I have never seen such tiny pieces of cake even in places that have a buffet-style dessert like Al-Bustan.\n\nOnly me and my brother were full. Mom and sister had to have pakoras and yesterday's leftovers coz it was too late to make anything. I told them that 2 deals would be enough for the 4 of us...and it wasn't. Having said that, at least for me and my brother, the experience was outstanding. And my mom and sister also agreed that  everything was yummy...if only the quantities were great.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-11T16:09:19+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-12T12:01:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTg0NjgyMjQz","before":"NjI1OTY4OTUz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"423139494403873","from":{"name":"Sameer Beg","id":"583446948"},"message":"ouch","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-11T16:33:37+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423321851052304","from":{"name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary","id":"100000093496883"},"message":"No, Muneeza Kidwai","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T05:48:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423393174378505","from":{"name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary","id":"100000093496883"},"message":"Pleasure..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T12:01:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDIzMzkzMTc0Mzc4NTA1","before":"NDIzMTM5NDk0NDAzODcz"}}},"restaurantName":"Hardee"},{"id":"165861103465048_423341894383633","from":{"name":"Maliha Ehtram","id":"557540354"},"message":"How efficient are the services of ClickforaMeal Pk??

Ambiance, I don't really care much for. \n\n1) BOTS: With over 200 dishes. It caters to my Chinese, Seafood, Bbq fixes all under ONE roof, What more can one ask for? \n2) GHAFFAR KABAB HOUSE: One place a food lover can never leave dissapointed. \n3) HARDEES: If I could eat one thing all day everyday. It would be a GREAT beef n cheese burger. And for me the Hardees Superstar is the best Beef Cheese karachi has to offer. As good as it is, the other burgers are equally as bad. \n4) XANDERS: Fried Calamari, Clasic Beef Cheese Burger & New York Cheese Cake 'nuff said. \n5) JAVED NIHARI: Regular Swotties know me for being a desi food fanatic. And it doesn't get any desier than Javed Nihari. Best Nihari in Karachi.  \n6) AGHA SAJJI HOUSE : This is just for my katakat fix. Beats all katakat places I've ever had. And I've had katakat at more than a dozen places atleast. \n7) DONISL : My second favorite Kakakat joint, used to be my first. Quality has gone down. \n8) CAFE BLUE GINGER: Beef In Oyster Sauce.

The pastries over there were divine , I had the rasberry cheescake and the caramel eclairs WOWZA! They're pretty pricey at around SAR 10 - 15 a piece but totally worth it. You can also buy a cup of Coffee over there , so it makes for a great breakfast. There are loads of small ghetto-ish looking Turkish Cafe's in Makkah they do awesome \"Doner Kebabs\" \"Iskander Kebabs\" and \"Qabsa\" definitely head to one of them ask any local in the city where the nearest \"MATAM TURKIYE\"  (Arabic for Turkish Restaurant) is . There are a bunch of Sudanese and various African run establishments slightly away from the Haram circle look for the signs saying \"FUUL\" (in Arabic) , just for being adventurous try Fuul its like an African delicacy made of beans, chickpeas and various spices .  If by any chance you start to miss Pakistani food head to the Hotel Ravi in Madinah its right across the street from Al Baik if I am not wrong there's only one Al Baik in Madinah. OMG that place does the best Pakistani food I've had outside Pakistan , great Chicken Karahi , Chicken Achari and by far the best Lassi I've ever had (seriously even Lahore couldn't beat it ). One word of advice the best food in both of the cities is in areas slightly away from the respective Haram circles. If you plan to stay within the Haram areas then your choices are restricted to the cliche  Starbucks, KFC, McD's , Hardees , Baskin & Robbins and really really bad Shawarma's .

The place was full with people waiting like they will be getting the meal for free.  Cleanliness in the dining area is a major issue, the management just isn't bothered and can't handle the rush.  The ice vending machine was out of order and there was a person standing at the drinks counter with a bucket of ice.  All soft drinks were flat and at room temperature.  The fries both French and Curly were served absolutely cold and are a waste coz the same cant be consumed.  The burgers were nothing great to write home about, we ordered the mushroom & Swiss thick burger, grilled chicken, jalape?o and buffalo along with side orders of chilli lava fries and chicken tenders.  There was an excessive use of sauces and mayo in the burgers that the patty kept slipping out of the buns.  The buns were, however, very fresh and soft.   The only item worth mentioning are the chicken tenders which were served fresh with a sauce which had an amazing flavour.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T19:10:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-07T13:17:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"555701439","name":"Raamish Zaidi Irani"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"669795452","name":"Haseeb Akhtar"},{"id":"726690443","name":"Danial Rizvi"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"561399662","name":"M Azwerul Haque"},{"id":"620275602","name":"Maria Jaffar"},{"id":"510835801","name":"Nudrrat Khawaja"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"},{"id":"100003784320529","name":"Shahzad Saeed"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"100000391823197","name":"Farah S.
