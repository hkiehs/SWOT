Though it was more on the spicy side for me.\n\nI did not try the other one but according to another fellow swottie it was also quite good.\n\nStarters:\nFor starters we had Chicken Drumsticks, Prawn balls and Prawn Toast.\nThe starters were cold initially but after requesting them to change it we were served with fresh hot ones. \nPrawn toast was a personal favorite .\nI found the prawn balls to be quite bland.\nThey being cold ruined the taste for me a bit.\n\nMains:\nFor Mains there was\nChicken Manchurian:\nMy much raved about personal favorite. Was a Disappointment at RE. The CM lacked gravy and was quite dry and too sweet. But had generous amounts of chicken. It was more of a mashed mush rather then a saucy Manchurian.\n\nBeef in Oyester Sauce:\nDefiantly got me going back for more. Was super yum soft and moist. Bit on the oily side though.\n\nVegetable in Coconut Curry:\nTasted okayish. The veggies were cut quite large making it hard to eat.\nThe coconut curry was an interesting blend of flavors though.\n\nVegetable Chowmein:\nAgain I found it quite bland. Nothing to write about.\n\nThere was one more dish I'm forgetting.\n\nDesserts:\nThere was 5 kinds of desserts \nChocolate moose. Cheesecake \nCustard. Fruit chat. Walnut muffins.\n\nThe cheesecake was loved by everyone.\nI personally loved the chocolate moose.\n\nFRUIT CHAT on a Chinese buffet. Like seriously bhai kia chah rahay ho. Iftari thori hai :P \n\nOverall:\nHad an amazing time meeting up with the people who share the similar love for food. \nThe food was quite cold would have appreciated warmer servings.\nFor taste I would give it a 6/10\nChoice of dishes 5/10\n\nService on the other hand was exceptionally good.\nMeeting the owners themselves was quite pleasent.\nLoved our complimentey cups of greentea.\n\nPriced at 1100 per person.

Starters had steamed wontons and prawn tempura which I was happy to see, steamed wontons/dumplings (dimsum) is a fav and thank god becoming popular here too. The rice and noodles were both well seasoned and cooked well. In fact many commented how nice the rice was on its own. Chicken Schezuan was amazing as was the beef chili dry, and honey chicken with sesame (a little too sweet for my taste) the sticky sweet fish I don't like anywhere and this was no exception thu really liked the lemon fish. \n\nAll in all a good evening spent with great friends checking out a new place.

Hakka Chinese with Mughal Decor.  Red Emperor is as much Hakka, as Ginsoy is Extreme.  The service was terribly slow, and there seemed absence of basic protocol.  Cutlery was missing (even though table was reserved in advance), the place ran out of napkins, no one bothered taking order for drinks (despite reminders), and it took at least twenty minutes before water was finally served (after repeated reminders).  \n\nSoup was served 30 minutes after the order was placed, while the rest of the dishes were served after a solid wait of 50 minutes.  Even then there were order mix-ups, and the staff just wasn't aware of what's happening.  And like always, the excuse was the typical old school one, 'sir aaj rush zyada hai...' -- fair enough.  \n\nThe food is typical Desi-fied Chinese, and hence it doesn't really have any distinct flavor.  Tried the Chicken Schezwan Soup, Fish in Tamarind Sauce, Mixed Fried Rice, Beef Chili Chowmein, and the Sichuan Chicken.  Nothing special about the flavor of any entree.  The serving sizes were massive, making it a favored choice for a value seeker.  With per head cost of roughly PKR500, Red Emperor is a pretty reasonable Desi Chinese option.\n\nThe service is a major bummer, and the food is just fine -- nothing special about it.  The place doesn't really have any differentiating factor, and is equally good (or bad) as Ginsory, or Jade Garden.\n\nNot recommended if one is looking for a smooth flavorful dinner experience.\n\nOverall Rating -- 6/10\n\nOn a side note -- the lightning at the place is just too dim, making going over the menu, and the bill, an arduous task.  I like to see my food -- why can't certain restaurants be more brighter!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-15T00:26:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-15T12:51:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"646760193","name":"Rehma Tirmizey"},{"id":"556911379","name":"Shaheer Hassan"},{"id":"769030393","name":"Muhammad Danniyal Jafri"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"1560344939","name":"Zahid Qureshi"},{"id":"1488962130","name":"Zulfiqar Ali"},{"id":"100001207576659","name":"Faisal Rafiq"},{"id":"100005945647613","name":"Sara H Khan"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"832750315","name":"Romano Karim Yusuf"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"873280323","name":"Umair Zia"},{"id":"801035182","name":"Asad Kamran"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"512542175","name":"Nabiya Fahad Khan"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"684094046","name":"Faiza Hasan"},{"id":"1346742308","name":"Ijlal Malik"},{"id":"1191501552","name":"Ali Majeed S T"},{"id":"561575202","name":"Usuf Haroon"},{"id":"647940246","name":"Maheen Khan Omair"},{"id":"523153232","name":"Hira Humayun"},{"id":"757255502","name":"Faryal Naeem Warind"},{"id":"502333997","name":"Annie Adnan Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAyMzMzOTk3","before":"NjQ2NzYwMTkz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_603313529719801/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTAyMzMzOTk3"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"603412379709916","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Great review once again.

Had tried it once last year and that was out of the world but what I Received YESTERDAY was NOT upto the standard! I really didn't want to complain,but since I spent so much,didn't really feel good. The Chicken Chowmein was very dry and was tasteless (not juicy like before) the fried rice were not warm at all,seemed stale..it seemed that they were directly delivered from the fridge..without heating up..Manchurian was alright but too spicy..it didn't look as if it was GD...the quantity was enough to serve the 4 of us..but I was not really satisfied. Just sharing my experience. :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-19T08:47:52+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-20T22:29:16+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"588284567889364","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Thanks Hamna for sharing your experience..Could you please let us know the time and under whose name the order was placed...I would like to look into this matter personally..The complain of stale/not warm rice was of great concern as everything is cooked fresh...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-19T09:50:48+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"588292077888613","from":{"name":"Hamna Adnan","id":"100006047281817"},"message":"You're most welcome.

Special WOK Soup (white) is refreshingly different in taste from other special soups being offered by Chinese food outlets. Butterfly Prawns for starters were excellent. Prawns were of good size and just the right amount of batter. We were recommended fried fish with crumbs by the order taker (not in menu I guess) and although it's not really Chinese food but perhaps best fried fish you can have in Karachi. I requested for something in beef and was suggested Beef Bulgoki, another stellar dish which was adequately spiced, and meat was tender as compared to any normal Beef Dry Chilly. Thai Chowmein is also a great offering for people with taste for Chowmein, again a recommendation from the gentleman who took order. I found WOK great in terms of value for money as portions were generous (specially rice) and food arrived well in time (about 35 minutes, but then I live in Clifton) and in piping hot condition.

I've ordered it enough times to know that this is isn't a regular occurrence but i feel that i should highlight it so that it doesn't occur again.\n So i ordered Chicken Chowmein, Beef with basil and chilies, chicken in coconut cream and chili and prawn chili dry. The order arrived on time and was piping hot, but when i started eating i realized there was something off. The chowmein was bland, and by that i don't mean that it wasn't spicy, it just had no flavor (no instructions were given as to make it less spicy), doused it with the chili sauce and only then it was slightly eatable. The chicken in coconut cream and chili tasted like the coconut cream had gone bad (and i've eaten it a couple of times to know what it tastes like). The only saving grace was the beef w/ basil and chilies which i enjoyed. The prawn chili dry was also eatable.\n  I understand that an eatery might be having an off day but it should not be the day when i am ordering in. I enjoy Chairman Mao and i feel that such bad experiences should not deter me from ordering again.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-02T07:15:20+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-02T20:45:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"1205101053","name":"Misbah Vaid Rizwan Hussain"},{"id":"513566148","name":"Falak Sher"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEzNTY2MTQ4","before":"NzEwNDcwODgy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"499346006783221","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Did you call back and let Chairman Mao know about your experience?

We hogged the food literally. \nSpecial meesage for GD as they insisted I write this: \"My team thinks Golden Dragon is the best Chinese they have eaten in a long time and also said Thank you for being punctual and delivering hot food\" Seriosuly guys when you work with a team  they are like family and when they were beaming after lunch it felt good:)  Even the rice which I normally find bit undercooked was perfect. 11/10 because it was my treat and made me feel super;-)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-18T19:47:55+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-19T07:49:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"529040368","name":"Syed Mudassir Hussain"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzkyNDcwMTcw","before":"MTA3NjI4NTIxNQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"400086203375869","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"that review is icing on the cake","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-18T19:51:06+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400087536709069","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Too many typos..must be the suroor from the losing the cricket match! lol!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-18T19:53:34+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400118713372618","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Farhat Rabia:Your reviews are always a treat to read and this one is like as najmi sahab said ' icing on the cake'...Thank You!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-18T20:58:46+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia","type":"user","offset":0,"length":12}]},{"id":"400357003348789","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"QA...anytime as long as food is good im a happy camper:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-19T07:33:48+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400357496682073","from":{"name":"De Joe","id":"597535350"},"message":"u should try the crispy beef....... its sinfully good.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-19T07:36:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400361970014959","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"oh yeah..next time for sure!thanks for the sugegstion!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-19T07:49:31+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDAwMzYxOTcwMDE0OTU5","before":"NDAwMDg2MjAzMzc1ODY5"}}},"restaurantName":"Chowmein"},{"id":"165861103465048_399525170098639","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Dinner from Jen Ko Gae (Korean Restaurant): Tofu Kimchi / Prawn Tempura with Sweet Potato Fries / Beef Bulgoki / Crispy Sizzling Fish in Chilli Sauce / Chicken Buckwheat Noodle Chowmein / Steamed Sticky Rice with Wafer-Thin Seaweed...Perfection and a perfect end to a Sunday evening","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-17T19:44:13+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-18T16:54:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"684515056","name":"Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"558690791","name":"Zehra Zaidi"},{"id":"100003898006618","name":"Zarfras Siddiki"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

This Noodle Roll they sent over is an interesting concoction...never quite had anything like it but I must say it tastes very good...a sort of egg roll stuffed with noodles and vegetables that makes a good hors d'ouvre. Very generous quantities and good value for money that one equates with comfort food after a long day. The order arrived on time and piping hot all the way to KDA-1. I must mention that a Mr. Ali took my order on the phone and was very efficient and ensured that the chilli levels in the food were low as per my instructions (except of course the beef chilli dry).

I had opted the deal for three with Hot and Sour Soup which was very ketchupy and not at all thick the way soup should be, the wantons were good, the Chicken chilly vegetable had very little chicken and predominantly more of raw and uncut vegetables which should have been finally chopped, they refused me Chicken fried rice and instead gave me Garlic rice which was under cooked (Katcha) and had a funny smell in it. The need to work on their rice and cook it properly so it retains its flavor and is soft not hard and dry. Last but not the least the Chicken Chowmein noodles were also undercooked and could be much better in quality. I agree the helping was good but its no use if they cannot maintain the quality and match flavor and taste of the competitors. I feel that the lady who runs this place, is very conscientious and will take my critique positively and make an effort to improve on the quality and flavor.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T18:39:56+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-06T19:02:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjY4OTYxNDAz","before":"MTAwMDAyNjY4OTYxNDAz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"374072335977256","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Azam Sultan Ahmed:Thank you for ordering from Golden Dragon.We appreciate your honest review .I have noted down all the complains and would look into it...Please accept my humble apologises for your bad experience.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-06T18:55:01+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","type":"user","offset":0,"length":17}]},{"id":"374079279309895","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Azam Sultan Ahmed Ur welcome, i gave my honest feedback because i know are still new and have a lot of room for improvement.I would look forward to ordering from GD again....as and when you feel that my suggestions have been implemented.....and I would order as recommended!
