The place has been done up brilliantly. Staff is extremely courteous and very helpful. The complimentary bread basket served with garlic butter is possibly one of the best ones in town. Ordered the escargots as starters and they were still as excellent as I had those nearly a decade ago in the old Alyanto. For main course I ordered the grilled beef wasabi sandwich while my friend ordered the ham burger. My sandwich was fairly good with a slight bitterness of wasabi, and while good I have had better sandwiches. The ham burger's patty was of quite a good proportionate size. Another point that ought to be mentioned is that presentation of the food is amazing and looks nothing short of art. Overall experience 9 out of 10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-17T11:38:56+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T11:38:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"524665437","name":"Saher Najam"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ1NjIwMTMz","before":"MTI2OTU1ODY2MA\u003d\u003d"}}},"restaurantName":"Cafe Alyanto"},{"id":"165861103465048_591055150945639","from":{"name":"Mohammad Zaryab Khan","id":"100001714968094"},"message":"Wanna go tonight for a good family dinner but it should not be buffet.
