have I eaten something I didn't like. I even loved their weird sweet pumpkin dessert.\n\nToday was no exception for the 7 of us - since the 8th one forgot to RSVP (which by the way means you are getting NO more invites from me) - debated between CHINA KITCHEN or FUCHSIA (ok I put up the debate everyone else was unanimous) - short story long we landed up at FUCHSIA.\n\nI arrived a few minutes late to find my friends seated comfortably, half had ordered and one was enjoying a fluorescent blue drink - something margarita. \n\nThe order was taken by a very competent Irfan. Loved his smiling face and courteous nature, also when he conspiratorially told me on a few orders \"madam order two,  one will be too little\" I knew he was our perfect host for the evening......he had understood here are the eaters. SWOT gatherings are dry....we concentrate only on the food and its quality.\n\nWhat all did we order:-\n1) clear Tom yum soup with seafood,\n2) the cloudy Tom  yum \n3) the coconut cream based Tom yum gha soup \n4) papaya salad without prawns (hence chicken)\n5) papaya salad normal\n6) soya beef (oh god in wish I had order one for each)\n7) Thai prawn cakes.\n8) beef in oyster sauce,\n9) dry beef chilie (divine)\n10) wok fried prawns \n11) chicken red curry\n12) spicy Pad Thai noodles,\n13) stir fry glass noodles,\n14) chocolate mousse (3)\n15) fried chocolate wontons with green tea ice cream (2)\n16) iced Thai tea \n17) fuchsia coloured pi?a colada\n18) orange juice (only thing disappointing on the order)\n19) cold drinks\n20) green tea.\n\nHOLY SWOT......did the 7 of us seriously order and eat all this food. WOW WE ARE PAITOOS.\n\nit was an unprecedentedly a great evening. Loved every morsel of what we ate. I will love the left overs for naashta, since I  scraped all the sauces from all the curries and dishes in to one - like a Thai Haleem. \n\nToday I discovered that I am a little low on some vitamins - after this meal the vitamin C from the birds eye will cover all that.\n\nTeam Aylanto - this is e best thing you could have done for Karachi. \n\nOne point - it's amazing that the best chocolate mousse in town is served at a Thai restaurant.

I even loved their weird sweet pumpkin dessert.\n\nToday was no exception for the 7 of us - since the 8th one forgot to RSVP (which by the way means you are getting NO more invites from me) - debated between CHINA KITCHEN or FUCHSIA (ok I put up the debate everyone else was unanimous) - short story long we landed up at FUCHSIA.\n\nI arrived a few minutes late to find my friends seated comfortably, half had ordered and one was enjoying a fluorescent blue drink - something margarita. \n\nThe order was taken by a very competent Irfan. Loved his smiling face and courteous nature, also when he conspiratorially told me on a few orders \"madam order two,  one will be too little\" I knew he was our perfect host for the evening......he had understood here are the eaters. SWOT gatherings are dry....we concentrate only on the food and its quality.\n\nWhat all did we order:-\n1) clear Tom yum soup with seafood,\n2) the cloudy Tom  yum \n3) the coconut cream based Tom yum gha soup \n4) papaya salad without prawns (hence chicken)\n5) papaya salad normal\n6) soya beef (oh god in wish I had order one for each)\n7) Thai prawn cakes.\n8) beef in oyster sauce,\n9) dry beef chilie (divine)\n10) wok fried prawns \n11) chicken red curry\n12) spicy Pad Thai noodles,\n13) stir fry glass noodles,\n14) chocolate mousse (3)\n15) fried chocolate wontons with green tea ice cream (2)\n16) iced Thai tea \n17) fuchsia coloured pi?a colada\n18) orange juice (only thing disappointing on the order)\n19) cold drinks\n20) green tea.\n\nHOLY SWOT......did the 7 of us seriously order and eat all this food. WOW WE ARE PAITOOS.\n\nit was an unprecedentedly a great evening. Loved every morsel of what we ate. I will love the left overs for naashta, since I  scraped all the sauces from all the curries and dishes in to one - like a Thai Haleem. \n\nToday I discovered that I am a little low on some vitamins - after this meal the vitamin C from the birds eye will cover all that.\n\nTeam Aylanto - this is e best thing you could have done for Karachi. \n\nOne point - it's amazing that the best chocolate mousse in town is served at a Thai restaurant.

The quantity of rice should be equal to the curry but no complaints. However, not a big bringal fan. Will ask them not to add that next time. Not that it changed the flavor or anything. It tasted just like the TRC at Deli and Fuschia so I would give it a 7.5/10.

Pretty decent. The variety for iftar was good, and tasted nice too. Actually, someone like me could have had a complete meal from what was on offer from iftar buffet! :) There were 4 of us, so we ordered 4 different dishes from the main course option. I had rosemary infused beef, and liked it. The seafood teriyaki platter (i think that was it) was ok. Wouldn't recommend it! Thai green curry was also not bad, but nothing for which i'd rush back. Fuschia is much better for that. Desserts need to be worked upon. Overall, it was a nice experience. Another great thing about the place was that there is a gent's prayer area just walking distance from the restuarant.

Last week was my birthday and I had planned on taking some friends out for a nice sit down dinner. The dinner was set for Friday and I called Fuschia on Tuesday to book their private room for 13 people. On Thursday I went to Fuschia and set the menu and increased the booking to 14 people, I was informed I will be able to accommodate 14 people in the private room. At 11:30 in the night I received a call from Fuschia informing me that they have no record of my booking for the private room and that I had just booked a table in the smoking section, they also informed me that the private room was already booked and the party had already paid a deposit.After arguing for a while the lady on the phone admitted she made a mistake with my booking, I understand human error is unavoidable but to realize this and inform me at 11:30pm the night before is unacceptable. I was extremely disappointed as I was looking forward to enjoying my night in privacy. In protest I cancelled my booking and was basically left without a venue 1 night before my dinner  :( and I knew finding a place for 14 on a Friday night would not be an easy task. A friend recommended Thyme, I called them up Friday afternoon and they graciously informed me they would make all the necessary arrangements for me on such short notice. Thyme did a lovely job, we took over almost the entire upper floor, I set a standardized menu (Chicken satay and Greek salad for starters and as mains an option of chicken in tarragon sauce, roast beef with risotto, prawn in thyme sauce or red snapper on a bed of crab meat) and they wrote out the options on their board for my guests. Dim lights, candles and soft music created the perfect atmosphere. The service was efficient, polite and it was an overall heart warming experience.... I highly recommend Thyme and really don't understand why it's not as popular as other similar restaurants.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T17:30:27+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-09T04:06:58+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"797300590","name":"Aman Virji"},{"id":"593086875","name":"Pervin Minwalla"},{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"668675270","name":"Maliha Ejaz"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"500616229","name":"Sama Aman"},{"id":"1768497575","name":"Ally Aadil Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTc2ODQ5NzU3NQ\u003d\u003d","before":"Nzk3MzAwNTkw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"374029089314914","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Wow.

Then we wantedmain courses while our friendsjust wanted beverages and dessert - and the manager says, u can't only have dessert. You have to order dinner too. Can u believe this utter crap? The customer is not allowed to decide if he/she just want dessert. We tried to reason with them, that two people WERE ordering main courses, so why couldn't the others have dessert, but he refused.
