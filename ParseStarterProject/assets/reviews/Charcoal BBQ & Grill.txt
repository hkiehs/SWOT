Went there yesterday, the overall service was okay, but the setup of serving was small according to the number of people for the iftar. Food quality was very much below average. I was literary finding something good to eat. Charcoal is a BBQ and Grill place and only 1 BBQ item was served which was reshmi kabab. I literary had to fight to cut my pepper steak, it was almost like a rubber and very poorly cooked. Prawns were served almost raw. The only eatable thing i found was chicken karhaye and Beef Chillie. The desserts were pathetic, i was expecting some good taste after looking at the desserts area. The ice-cream was like a frozen sweet milk. The chocolate cake and other chocolate items had a very bad taste. I will definitely not recommend anyone to go to Charcoal BBQ & Grill. Their a la carte is good, but at iftar buffet and dinner; they have seriously compromised the quality.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-11T00:47:15+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-11T00:47:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"668090430","name":"Qazi Umair"},{"id":"507348941","name":"Muhammad Waqas"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA3MzQ4OTQx","before":"NjY4MDkwNDMw"}}},"restaurantName":"Charcoal BBQ & Grill"}]}
