It's a Canadian chain. The taste was authentic Italian and in the cold weather, we had a tasty experience. Service was friendly and on time. Capacity, wasn't very large, I think ~40. Cost wise I'd say it's at par with PH, with some good deals eg 2 large (12\") with 1.5L Coke Rs. 1640 (without tax). My colleague from America, said he didn't have such pizza outside of US lately.

Missed them all :-( Did go to Espresso and PITS (after hearing some girls in the line that there is something there) but i got done at 8:30 so it had ended. Treated myself to Manhattan Pizzeria and once again I was bowled away by a fantastic pizza...the Buffalo Chicken one. Would also recommend the Famous 2 deal at Red Apple the one with chicken cheese roll and chicken cheese burger. MUST try. Juicy moist yummy burger and that roll was just heaven on earth...every bite had cheese in it. And for 250 bucks it was too good to be true. Lastly, the Kaybees icecream is still great....and will take you on the nostalgic ride as the taste (along with the packaging, the perfect taste of ice cream with no after taste) is amazingly the same as it was years ago.
