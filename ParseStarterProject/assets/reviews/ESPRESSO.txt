A few lapses to be noted while giving the order. Had to repeat my order 3 times before the guy completely understood what I wanted. Secondly, no plastic money accepted, as of yet. So that was a little bummer.\nReceived my order in under 15-18 minutes. Good enough.\nWhen receiving the order, I asked whether or not there is the additional Tribeca Sauce topping that I asked (and paid) for. Apparently, they forgot that. No problem. Happens. But instead of adding that to the burger, they gave it to me as a dip.\nNow as for the burgers, yes the Tribeca Twins tasted good. But that's it. The burger tasted just....\"good\". Yes it is the only place as of yet the patty of which reminds you of Mr. Burger (which I think has THE most unique beef patty). The burger was good. Some would definitely call it brilliant. They have every right to call it so. But to me personally, it was just....lacking that \"kick\" which could make it an \"outstanding\" burger.\nAs for the Fried Chicken Fillet Burger, it was yet another experience. Hands down, THE most well-cooked piece of chicken I've had in my burger in ages. The time for which it was kept in the fryer, brilliant. Juicy, soft, moist; I can go on and on as to the quality of the chicken and the way it was cooked.\nThe fries though, for Rs. 100 were yet again just....\"okay\". Nothing exceptional about them as well.\n\nSo, would I visiting Burger Inc. again? Definitely. As I said, it's not at all bad. It's good. It's nice.\nWould I be expecting Burger Inc. to surprise me with its flavor? Sadly, no.\nBut that's just about me and my own taste buds.\n\nOnto the next experience, which was yesterday, at Del Frio. I've read posts of many different members having rough days at Del Frio, ranging from rude staff to over-cooked/burnt pizza base, but in all honesty, yesterday was my 7th or 8th visit at their SMCHS outlet and I am yet to experience a bad day with them. I've been visiting Del Frio at that outlet from the time they didn't even have the credit/debit-card machines (starting days) and my orders have ranged from pizzas to sandwiches, coffees to slushes (which they call \"XYZ ice\", depending on the flavors) and everything everytime has not just been consistent but remarkably tasty as well. Yesterday, the outlet was fairly full and I ordered my usual there, which was the Hot n Spicy pizza and the Hazelnut Cappuccino. The pizza was yum. As always. The cappuccino, though not the best I've had in K-Town (I enjoy Bella Vita's and ESPRESSO's Hazelnut Cappuccino THE most, and noone else comes close), but was just the way it always serves.\nI agree many of you have had bad times at Del Frio, but I really haven't had any such experience from them as of yet.\n\nEat on people!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-06T01:32:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-06T01:32:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001249191882","name":"Fozia Amjad"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"514392526","name":"Mahnaz Fahad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE0MzkyNTI2","before":"MTAwMDAxMjQ5MTkxODgy"}}},"restaurantName":"ESPRESSO"},{"id":"165861103465048_644801725570981","from":{"name":"Maheen N.
