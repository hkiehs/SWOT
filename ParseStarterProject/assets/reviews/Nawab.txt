You will find a select variety of similar dishes at The Pakistani (Sherato) and Dumpukht (Marriott) albeit in a limited version. Overall, Karachi does not have too many North Indian/Mughlai food places that are abundantly found in other parts of the world, especiialy UK, Europe, North America and the Middle East. Pakistani food is more onion/tomato based that is grounded in ghee for flavor whereas a lot of North Indian cuisine is texture-based and uses rich thickeners like fresh cream, dried fruit pastes and yogurt as well as pureed forms of vegetables i.e. spinach, palak, onions are usually pureed to create a thick aromatic curry. Some of the dishes you maybe able to find at Nawab would include Chicken Makhni (Indian style), Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Kashmiri, Mutton Roganjosh, Vegetable Makhni, Palak Paneer, Palak Kadai and Dal Makhni (with red beans: rajma) to name just a few. Also, at The Pakistani you can request the chef to make a dish of your choice that's not on the menu and usually he'll fix you something custom to your taste buds (esp if it's a weekday and there aren't too many people around). I so can relate to your craving for this genre of food; too bad the options are limited in Karachi on this one.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-27T18:46:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"625216677529486","from":{"name":"Saba Noor","id":"832395133"},"message":"Thank you so much babar ...
