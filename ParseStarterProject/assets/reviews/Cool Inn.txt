Ive always had to ask for extra yogurt and then have had to resend it for pouring some more in. but the flavour is still the best i've had of all places. \n\nMasala Dossa: its grown! i guess Mirchi took some clientelle away. and more loaded too this time! i didnt taste much curry leaves this time or mustard seed but it was still piping hot and crisp and massive!\n\nAloo Masala: erm. no. i make better. and ive had better from this baba who use to bring a small cooking pot filled with aloo masala from home next to Rainbow Centre. his were divine. i think he passed away. and i tried to recreate his at home. but his were the best. that thing about cooking with love? must've been it. used to make a very small quantity but it was absolutely spot onn the flavour you've heard of.\n\nUnfair of me to compare Cool-Inns with baba's. so why? well simpy cuz these aloo masala  from Cool Inn were big and chunky: the way they're supposed to be. but. the masala is kooti lal mirchi in not-very-bhunna hua tomato sauce. Masala needs to be well bhunna hua. if not it just tastes undone. and thats what cool-inn's was. i'll ignore it didnt have tamarind and thank heavens for autumn and flavourful coriander leaves otherwise i bet in teh summers id have flat flavoured coriander. \n\nnow Al-Rehman. \nbun kebabs were perfectly desi. thank God they asked if i wanted the typical or the one with ketchup and cole slaw: ICK!!! no no was good old desi egg-mashed lentil with onions and green chutney for me. moist. yum. desi bun kebab. you cant talk about theier flavours. no. not in words. you can just enjoy them. \n\naloo chholay: very home -made flavour. so i like\n\nthe one thing about alll three places today; everything was piping hot! i havent had that in sometime. \n\nall in all: chaat. and simply yum!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-11T15:13:10+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-11T15:49:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"892195391","name":"Tehreem Fatima"},{"id":"575820034","name":"Maheen Kamran"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3Mjg3Mzkz","before":"MTIxMzYzNzA4Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"458957674155388","from":{"name":"Saifullah Mazhar","id":"517287393"},"message":"What a review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-11T15:49:43+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDU4OTU3Njc0MTU1Mzg4","before":"NDU4OTU3Njc0MTU1Mzg4"}}},"restaurantName":"Cool Inn"},{"id":"165861103465048_420938361290653","from":{"name":"Sanjay Gangwani","id":"100000233847058"},"message":"Where do I get the best pani puri and pav bhaji in Karachi ?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-05T14:15:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-07T10:03:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003334146114","name":"Maria Khurram"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAzMzM0MTQ2MTE0","before":"MTAwMDAzMzM0MTQ2MTE0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"420986191285870","from":{"name":"Maryam Khalid","id":"1586756872"},"message":"Gurumandir ..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-05T17:08:59+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"421010661283423","from":{"name":"Sanjay Gangwani","id":"100000233847058"},"message":"Thanks any particular place?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-05T18:29:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"421023207948835","from":{"name":"Tehniat Aftab","id":"544811222"},"message":"I love pani puri and chaat by Saleem's in phase 1 near Tooba Apartments opposite Spinzer's.

Prepared and served hygienically in disposable containers/plates.  Though I am not a Zinger type burger fan, however, people rave about Cool Inn's Zinger clone.  The masala dossa is also pretty decent and the Spicy Chicken Boti Bun has a unique flavour (be cautioned its really really spicy).  They also make a  great faluda and the cold-stone ice cream (which they call as Katakat Ice Cream) is very good for the price.  Love their dark chocolate flavour and have it  \"Katakated\" with Soft Mints with a topping of chocolate sauce.  They serve the Katakat Ice Cream in a waffle cup which is crispy and delicious.  A whole variety of ice cream flavours is available to suit all tastes. Cool Inn is a must visit place for all Chaat lovers.  Its great value for money.  The owner Noor Bhai is always present there and ensures quality and hygeine.  All their chutneys are made with mineral water and cooking/frying is done in Soya Supreme/Rafhan Corn Oil.
