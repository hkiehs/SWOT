Then a budget friendly Broast at karachi snacks and maybe end it up with something casual at Dolmen mall clifton.

We caught several eye balls and somehow every single person noticed our presence there but the staff over there, so we decided to step out. \n\nSince then Ive been bragging about this incident everywhere and I know Ive been able to convince some of my friends not to go there anymore. :)\n\nIf they treated me like they treated you I promise they would have ended up with broken jaws. \n\nI really feel bad for you sister!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-07T22:35:38+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false},{"id":"630138393703981","from":{"name":"Ali Nadeem","id":"100001691885342"},"message":"I'd rather go to Rehmat-e-Shirien and have their qulfi.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-07T22:40:03+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"630166317034522","from":{"name":"Zohaib Hasan","id":"726085463"},"message":"I had same issue.. not very friendly staff.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-07T23:51:32+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"630196930364794","from":{"name":"Muhummad Arshad","id":"1264475887"},"message":"She Fired Hatf 3 @ DelFrio!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-08T01:38:27+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"630218873695933","from":{"name":"Aamir Ahmed","id":"724851035"},"message":"Guys after reading all this I am not going there delfrio you lost a customer","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-08T02:54:44+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"630225987028555","from":{"name":"Lailumah Shah - Nasar","id":"1013410116"},"message":"You shouldn't have stayed .","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-08T03:17:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"630235200360967","from":{"name":"Sana Kassim Burhan","id":"100000398273041"},"message":"I have been there once but my experience was totally opposite from u,\nThe waiter was very welcoming and food was nice too.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-08T03:55:32+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"630246753693145","from":{"name":"Ata Ur Rehman","id":"777000220"},"message":"No one deserves to be treated like that especially at such overpriced places.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-08T04:48:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"630254943692326","from":{"name":"Sajid H.
