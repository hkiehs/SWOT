For sure, teething problems on the operations side and a limited menu. However, the Whopper with Cheese was 80% like the burgers that I have eaten at BK in other countries. The main difference being that this was more well done and a touch drier than the prior experiences. That may be a personal thing since I also eat my steak medium rare! The basic taste of the burger was the flame grilled rather than fried that I prefer but it did seem a tad hastily prepared. My sense is that within a short period of time, the minor issues that exist will be ironed out and BK will be the same in Karachi as it is for an occasional fast food indulgence abroad.\n\nPreviously, my biggest complaint, and main reason why BK was not usually in my fast food options, were the fries. The new BK fries are 300% better than before and were a pleasant surprise! No, not quite as good as McDonalds or OPTP but pretty darned good ... and I even think they will be better in a few days!! I didn't try the Pepsi but was told by a member of my dining group that it was quite good.\n\nAgain, please keep in mind that my positive comments do not seek to compare a fast food burger to the exceptional offerings that can be had at restaurants such as Forty4. For a fast food burger, I personally prefer the Whopper to the Big Mac... and might think about trying the Angus version too. So, all in all, happy to have BK here in Karachi as another dining option.\n\nFinally, the Dolmen Mall food scene has truly become something special with tons and tons of reputable options for quick food as well as restaurants. Others may differ in their opinion, and I respect that, however I am quite pleased!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-07T14:04:53+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-08T05:20:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"633230637","name":"Mahnaz Hadi"},{"id":"850785116","name":"Iruj Khawaja"},{"id":"527720164","name":"Sara Khan"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"100004201268402","name":"Shakil Ahmed"},{"id":"524548090","name":"Saba Shaikh"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"514079467","name":"Noor Rehman"},{"id":"794615955","name":"Adnan Qureshi"},{"id":"739067064","name":"Rakhshanda Khan"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"530485619","name":"Hana Faisal"},{"id":"514492150","name":"Syed Adeel Rizvi"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"864470709","name":"Syed Muhammad Taha Askari"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"100000223684855","name":"Sana A.

I did like my burger and fries but did compare it to others in town that are similar. This is not fast food but it isn't a gourmet joint either! \n\nHowever, I am surprised at why people are making such strong negative statements about the place. If I go somewhere and there is a long wait, it is my choice to wait or not. From what I saw, they were trying hard to do well and in time, I think their service will catch up with their customer service goals. \n\nAlso, the prices have been targeted and that is really amazing to me since I don't know how much people expect to pay for their food! Fatburger isn't inexpensive but it is well in line with other comparable places with the addition of the unlimited refills on sodas.\n\nI completely respect the right of my fellow SWOT members not to like a place, the food they ate, the cost of the food, to share their experiences whether positive or negative and maybe to the extent of not recommend it to others. However, some of the language and characterizations of Fatburger are bordering on being offensive and that is against my perception of what this page is about. And some of the figures being quoted for comparison are not particularly accurate ... one has to be careful with stuff like that because people do rely on the information that is presented here.\n\nBe fair, kind and honest. The place hasn't been open long and is definitely facing teething issues because hordes of people are descending on them. I found the staff to be cooperative, pleasant and motivated even as they made their mistakes! In my humble opinion, Fatburger is getting a raw deal from some people because I think their expectations are unreasonably high and they get disappointed because, especially after a long wait, at the end of the day, it is just a burger! And yes, there are plenty around that are as good or better but there are also plenty that are not!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-12T09:22:43+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-12T19:47:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"638165637","name":"Feri Rawanian"},{"id":"888075011","name":"Nayyer Rauf"},{"id":"667831252","name":"Syeda Akefah Hashmi"},{"id":"736425186","name":"Maryam Zahoor Ansari"},{"id":"502191902","name":"Zaigham Hidayatullah"},{"id":"594302255","name":"Feroze Jamall"},{"id":"689535117","name":"Ahsen Wali Mohammad"},{"id":"579933313","name":"Ali Daudpota"},{"id":"615181836","name":"Wajeeha Rehman"},{"id":"579716133","name":"Syma Nizami"},{"id":"100002046384968","name":"Usman Daudpota"},{"id":"502194439","name":"Ayesha Ahmad"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"603490700","name":"Mariam Bilgrami"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"513232132","name":"Nazia Latif"},{"id":"553960553","name":"Salman Mukaddam"},{"id":"512864890","name":"Scidra Usman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEyODY0ODkw","before":"NjM4MTY1NjM3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"486580491393106","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Yes.
