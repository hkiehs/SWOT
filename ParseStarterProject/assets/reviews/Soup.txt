It was a successful event and we had a great time meeting new people :)  \n\nFirstly last night was one of the coldest nights by far and I thought we were going to turn into popsicles but thanks to the  management at Sajjad that didn't happen. It was unusually and surprisingly warm. Its covered from all sides and has fires burning at different spots which is really nice. So this answers the question for all who have been seeking a warm spot at do darya.\n\nNow to the FOOD.\nStarters: Chicken Dhakka, Hot and Sour Soup, BBQ prawns, lemon chicken and fish dhakka.\n\nMains: Afghani Boti, Chicken karhai, Shahi Handi.\n\nSTARTERS:\n? Chicken Dhakka: \n The most loved starter off all time I assume. It had been wiped clean off the dish as soon as it hit the table. Boneless chicken fried in a delicious batter served with this amazing sauce. Hands down the best dish on the menu and a must must try.\n\n?Hot & Sour Soup:\nDefiantly has room for improvement. But since we were sitting in a Pakistani themed Resturant i didn't expect a tiny Chinese man dancing out of my soup. So all good.\n\n?BBQ Prawns: \nOk i am not a seafood person at all. So according to the people who ate them they did enjoy. Its a very interesting dish. Plain simple flavours which enhanced the taste of the prawns \n\n?Lemon Chicken:\nAnother of my favorites. YUM i felt like im in chicken heaven. Crunchy chicken fried perfectly packed with that lemon zing. At the same time it didnt over power the chicken.\nI would keep going back for that.\n\n?Fish Dhaka:\nAnother one of the yummi delights. Me not being a sea food person fell for them like i slipped on a banana peel. \nMust try again. A complete winter dish\n\nMAINS:\nWe had stuffed our selfs with the starters lol\n\n?Chicken Karhai:\nJust has a taste but now i know why are they famous for it. Tasted yum.\n\n?Afghani Beef Boti:\nI can keep returning for that every single day. Soft, filled with taste, melts in the mouth. Neither to spicy neither bland just the right amount of spices.\n\n?Shahi Chicken Handi:\nA shahi handi for a shahi gathering lol. \nI love it. Boneless chicken chunks cooked in butter and topped with cheese and hints of fresh herbs. It has that yummy creamy subtle taste. Geez my mouth still waters for it. Total justice to the dish.\n\nOverall: \nGreat service.\nFood arrived hot and on time.\nAttentive staff.\nLoved the plastic covers against the wind. \n\nSpecial thankyou to all the foodies that showed up. \nHope to see u all soon.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-29T14:35:00+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-02T21:31:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"541880374","name":"Noreen Ahmed"},{"id":"100001434743152","name":"Raza Rehmani"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"100003570224157","name":"Kashif Khan"},{"id":"100001356574653","name":"Rude Plannet Kennel Rpk"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"532470690","name":"Sana Zaeem"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"887535136","name":"Jabbar Abdul"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"796000540","name":"Nisa Abdul Basit Khan"},{"id":"100001217752738","name":"MehRose Khan"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"729875068","name":"Soomro Ali"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"733018407","name":"Nabeel Kazi"},{"id":"100002943458913","name":"Aisha Wali Muhammad"},{"id":"1356485615","name":"Samrah Owais"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5MjA0NTUy","before":"MTAwMDA1NDIxODIzNTg4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_674208709296949/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzQ5MjA0NTUy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"674210079296812","from":{"name":"Zohaib Ali Memon","id":"524501080"},"message":"need to make it to one of these some day","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:38:13+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213699296450","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"So who all came?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:10+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213745963112","from":{"name":"Khozema Soni","id":"513558813"},"message":"If this event took place why was that girl siting alone ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:18+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674216695962817","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Khozema Soni well there was a bit of miscommunication.

Prompt on time serving, extremely courteous waiters and to my surprise they were trained in english. The service made my day.  \n\nOk secondly a big WOW to the person who created the ambiance of that place. It looked and felt spectacular.\nAll red and really cozy. The upper decks had an even better feel.\nI award it the best looking restaurant at do darya *if there is such an award*\n\nI bounced around on all three decks and 3 different spots after finally deciding to settle down on the very first one :p. *salutes their level of patience*\n\nOk now food..\nOrdered chicken corn soup for starters, chicken fried rice, chicken manchurian and chicken chilli noodles.\n\nSoups:\nThick creamy with lots of corn that is exactly how i like my soup and that is exactly what i got.  So thumbs up.\n\nChicken Manchurian:\nI am the self proclaimed queen of manchurian lol and after searching through half the city i have finally found my manchurian spot !! It tasted spot on. Had the perfect hit of tanginess and the sweet and sour ka combo. One spoonful and i was dancing with the fishes. *moment of pure joyy*\n\nChicken Chilli Noodles:\nI just had a taste of them since im not a noodle person but my friend who is a freak o noodle enjoyed them enough to chow down the whole bowl. *they gotta be good*\n\nFried Rice:\n10/10 \n\nOverall:\nWith the total being around 2k with drinks i give it a yes for value for money.\nLoved the food and i learned its only their soft launch ka phase. Thumbs up to the service i very rarely get impressed by service.\nTaste 10/10\nAmbiance 11/10\nService 11/10","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-25T21:36:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-28T08:05:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"651643760","name":"Jasrah Mubarak"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100003048580286","name":"Nayyera Saeed"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"100003324650990","name":"Imran Chef"},{"id":"100006791794583","name":"Shaiful M Wala"},{"id":"655635427","name":"Joanna Cash"},{"id":"100001052705593","name":"Shan Baloch"},{"id":"100001577208784","name":"Shahzad Shahab"},{"id":"100000556308750","name":"Laraib Malik"},{"id":"1057693917","name":"Hira Abbasi"},{"id":"100001404799008","name":"Muhammad Hussain Khan"},{"id":"581135723","name":"Faizan Rasheed"},{"id":"1304434596","name":"Syeda Jabeen Jahanzeb"},{"id":"829254501","name":"Kamran Anwer"},{"id":"100003436701094","name":"Rayan Raza"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"796000540","name":"Nisa Abdul Basit Khan"},{"id":"867800502","name":"Hira Saiyed"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"100003156069393","name":"Shajia Sajjad"},{"id":"100003570224157","name":"Kashif Khan"},{"id":"100003361185490","name":"Iram Faisal"},{"id":"613251390","name":"Asma A.

Extremely spicy. Had no tanginess.\nDid someone drop a box of chillies and freaking forgot \nAnd who in the world adds huge freaking slices of lettuce in a freaking hot and Sour soup, are u freaking kidding me!!\n\nWontons:\nRequested for the steamed wontons. Since this was the first time im trying them are they supposed to be THIS spicy.\nCould not even eat them.\nMy friend who has a huge love for spiciness also gave up on them.\nPlus the way they were packed was soo unappetizing.\n\nSince when has chinese food become the mirchi ki dukaan. (-_-) \n\nChowmein:\nThe only edible thing. Thankgoodness wasn't loaded with spice.\nBut had no taste.\nAnd I'm no fan. \n\nChicken Manchurian.\nOk this is very close to my heart after trying Manchurian from all around the city and iv had Manchurian from GD before this time it was just a huge DISSAPOINTMENT. Completely  bland.\nNo hit from the taste.\nThe sauce was tasteless and the quantity was not enough as compared to the rice.\n\nEgg Fried Rice:\nOnly thing alright. I guess cooking it is idiot proof so they didn't mess it up. -_-\n\nOverall:\nIv had GD before and they have.lost the touch and taste. \nThe only thing is the QUANTITY but there is no point of quantity without taste.\nThe only taste I got was the spiciness.\nIf I wanted that I would have nibbled on a mirchi at home, why bother wasting mommy on Chinese.\n\nNot ordering again esp. After the spice  freakshow in front of my friend. Quantity does not mean u can compromise on taste.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-24T18:18:08+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-25T11:01:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"663526141","name":"Rizwana Shamim"},{"id":"1236316260","name":"Taimoor Nadeem"},{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"750786806","name":"Faixa Shah"},{"id":"907360281","name":"Sarah Leghari"},{"id":"100003305271172","name":"Muhammad Shaiekh"},{"id":"100003570224157","name":"Kashif Khan"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"1502690651","name":"Bilal Ali Khan"},{"id":"100003197584619","name":"Mairaj Khan"},{"id":"100001577208784","name":"Shahzad Shahab"},{"id":"707875486","name":"Ahsan Butt"},{"id":"514359736","name":"Sidra Khatri"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"100001404799008","name":"Muhammad Hussain Khan"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"100000794997816","name":"Erum Kashif"},{"id":"816865264","name":"Muhammad Arsalan Siddiqui"},{"id":"580291885","name":"Saba Aneeq"},{"id":"100001304376643","name":"Maqsood Ali"},{"id":"1584712453","name":"Alee Raza Jatoi"},{"id":"1359766063","name":"Faaz Shabbir"},{"id":"100003601960886","name":"Nadeem Usmani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAzNjAxOTYwODg2","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_671499542901199/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTAwMDAzNjAxOTYwODg2"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"671501619567658","from":{"name":"Faizan Mukarram","id":"1023815310"},"message":"a negative GD review..the world must be ending.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-24T18:23:43+0000","like_count":21,"user_likes":false},{"id":"671501696234317","from":{"name":"Aasma Ali Abbasi","id":"658280809"},"message":"heard alot goood about  GD although i havent give it a try.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-24T18:23:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"671501772900976","from":{"name":"Leena Faruqui","id":"512612823"},"message":"Totally agree with you on their insane spice levels, makes the food quite inedible.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-24T18:24:00+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"671502082900945","from":{"name":"Mehvish Abubakar","id":"508922509"},"message":"I think you meant money*...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-24T18:24:35+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"671503169567503","from":{"name":"Mehvish Abubakar","id":"508922509"},"message":"You can always ask them to adjust the spice level.

Had loads of corn and was loaded with chunks of boneless chicken. Thick and creamy with herbs.\nWas just perfect. I will be going back for more\nSame goes for the Hot and Sour.\nPlus the bread along with the soup that needs a separate thumbs up.   \n\nTheir Grilled fish is the best iv tasted.\nPerfectly cooked and steaming hot when it arrived.\n\nThe Charcoal platter ain't short of praises either. No wonder its the most loved. Was so full that couldn't try everything on it. But my friend loved it. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted yummiliious.\n\nOverall perfect food for this amazing winter, backed up by flawless speedy service.\n\nMy new go to spot for these winters :) who says Kolachi is the best on the strip, i suppose Charcoal has the tendency to give them a run for their money very soon. Really happy with the improvement in their taste and service.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-23T21:39:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-24T15:43:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"612205150","name":"Syeda Sara Hussain"},{"id":"100000340878641","name":"Ali Amin"},{"id":"100000114257107","name":"Rimsha Altaf"},{"id":"100000956691585","name":"Sauliha Qureshi"},{"id":"100003305271172","name":"Muhammad Shaiekh"},{"id":"805195531","name":"Amna Shah"},{"id":"100004286853739","name":"Mahwish Khawja Ghulam Rasool"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"100001758628950","name":"Muzzi Hussain"},{"id":"1311140673","name":"Yumna Salvatore"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"1560344939","name":"Zahid Qureshi"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"628832080","name":"Nuruddin Noorani"},{"id":"100002796731318","name":"Ruba Baig"},{"id":"1567906191","name":"Humera Abbasi Lari"},{"id":"100002068418798","name":"Sumaira Junaid"},{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"100002186645209","name":"Asma Uzair"},{"id":"100003197584619","name":"Mairaj Khan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"614890544","name":"Syeda Hareem Zahra"},{"id":"100000744651030","name":"Farah Sadiq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzQ0NjUxMDMw","before":"NjI0NjMyMDk5"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_671113466273140/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTAwMDAwNzQ0NjUxMDMw"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"671114849606335","from":{"name":"Rabeet Rao","id":"749204552"},"message":"Been heading to the Do Darya strip more than often (does 2 times in 3 days qualify to be more-than-often?), and Charcoal has been the top priority (after Kolachi).

Though it was more on the spicy side for me.\n\nI did not try the other one but according to another fellow swottie it was also quite good.\n\nStarters:\nFor starters we had Chicken Drumsticks, Prawn balls and Prawn Toast.\nThe starters were cold initially but after requesting them to change it we were served with fresh hot ones. \nPrawn toast was a personal favorite .\nI found the prawn balls to be quite bland.\nThey being cold ruined the taste for me a bit.\n\nMains:\nFor Mains there was\nChicken Manchurian:\nMy much raved about personal favorite. Was a Disappointment at RE. The CM lacked gravy and was quite dry and too sweet. But had generous amounts of chicken. It was more of a mashed mush rather then a saucy Manchurian.\n\nBeef in Oyester Sauce:\nDefiantly got me going back for more. Was super yum soft and moist. Bit on the oily side though.\n\nVegetable in Coconut Curry:\nTasted okayish. The veggies were cut quite large making it hard to eat.\nThe coconut curry was an interesting blend of flavors though.\n\nVegetable Chowmein:\nAgain I found it quite bland. Nothing to write about.\n\nThere was one more dish I'm forgetting.\n\nDesserts:\nThere was 5 kinds of desserts \nChocolate moose. Cheesecake \nCustard. Fruit chat. Walnut muffins.\n\nThe cheesecake was loved by everyone.\nI personally loved the chocolate moose.\n\nFRUIT CHAT on a Chinese buffet. Like seriously bhai kia chah rahay ho. Iftari thori hai :P \n\nOverall:\nHad an amazing time meeting up with the people who share the similar love for food. \nThe food was quite cold would have appreciated warmer servings.\nFor taste I would give it a 6/10\nChoice of dishes 5/10\n\nService on the other hand was exceptionally good.\nMeeting the owners themselves was quite pleasent.\nLoved our complimentey cups of greentea.\n\nPriced at 1100 per person.

Safe to say that was starvng and therefore ordered maybe too many starters and subsequently not enough main course but then there is always next time :). \n\nFor starters we ordered Prawn balls, Ginsoy Wraps and Chicken Drum Sticks along with the Thai Soup (the supersize portion they call large) and one order of sweet and sour (white). \n\nLets start with the soup... When a 5 year old drinks a soup and says Yummm... that says enough. One of the best I have had in a long time. The thai was so good that the sweet and sour infact got packed and taken home :).\n\nOf the starters the Wrap was excellent and I wish we had ordered more. The prawn balls were ok and the Chicken wings were also good. Again, if you go there and haven't tried I would recommend the Wraps.\n\nOnto the main course. The Cherry Chilli Chicken and the Spicy Garlic Chicken. I preferred the Cherry Chilli but overall great food. \n\nLet me add that the service was excellent and the staff very friendly... our server was Marison who did an excellent job. \n\nAll in all, a positive experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-27T08:18:01+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-27T10:45:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"502191902","name":"Zaigham Hidayatullah"},{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"638521516","name":"Abdul Ghaffar AG"},{"id":"511168242","name":"Akber Ali Khaliqdina"},{"id":"651674702","name":"Mohsin Baweja"},{"id":"885940595","name":"Ranjenah Bariya"},{"id":"586401160","name":"Ali Sheikh"},{"id":"505056779","name":"Adeel Humayun"},{"id":"1275940201","name":"Noman"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"688747484","name":"Uzair A Kaleem"},{"id":"732459812","name":"Asif Aslam"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"708482342","name":"Saba Basit"},{"id":"515208057","name":"Faizy Farooq"},{"id":"621305514","name":"Aniqa Imran"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjIxMzA1NTE0","before":"NzA1NTMzOTI0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"657927627591724","from":{"name":"Faizy Farooq","id":"515208057"},"message":"i can go to ginsoy again and again and again and again...................... and again.. and still not get bored of the awesome food it has to offer :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:34:56+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"657929180924902","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Great review Shujaat Alavi :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:40:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"853165219","name":"Shujaat Alavi","type":"user","offset":13,"length":13}]},{"id":"657932784257875","from":{"name":"Asim Ibrahim","id":"100004366567543"},"message":"location plz.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:54:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"657964200921400","from":{"name":"Saira Danish Ahmed","id":"1116196206"},"message":"I have been to both Ginsoy main and Ginsoy extension.

So, for 3 people, we ordered the following:\n\n* Chicken Corn Soup (I know, not many people order the classic Chicken Corn Soup, neither do we, but mother just insisted) - We ordered the large serving of the soup, and it was exactly 3 bowls of soup. No more, no less. Yes it was stated already in the menu that it serves 2-3 people, but the Ginsoy - Extreme Chinese fan in us thought there'd be more. Not at all a disappointment though, by any means. It was exactly what Chicken Corn Soup needs to be. Small little bits, but sufficient, of chicken, adequate amount of corn. The soup was just what it was supposed to be.\n\n* Wasabi Prawns for appetizers - The prawns were remarkably done. They had that wasabi-kick in them which was needed to give that \"buzz\" feel you want to have when eating a Wasabi Prawn. Yet again, there were 5 prawns in total, dot. Tastewise: Brilliant.\n\n* Fish Milano (my main) - Their Fish Milano was intended to be  a large fried fillet of fish placed delicately over a bed of green-herbs sauce and coated with cheese served with rice (as understood from the menu). It was exactly as described. I needed something cheesy and rich, and it definitely delivered. The fish was nicely done; flaky, properly fried, the type that just wants you to keep eating it. The green sauce under the fish was generous in quantity, but didn't quite have much of a \"burst of flavors\" that I was hoping for. But the cheese on top took care of that. All in all, a 7/10\n\n* Fish with Jalapeno *something*, mum's main (apologies for not remembering the complete name) - A similar sized fish to mine, fried as nicely as mine was, sat on the plate with sauteed vegetables, a serving of rice, and a small little bowl/cup containing the sauce for this dish. This sauce however, did have a distinctive taste to it. I actually borrowed some of it to use on my fish as well. The one thing common in the 2 mains was that the steamed rice that were served with them were simply the best ever steamed rice I've ever had in my life. The rice had an amazing feel to them in the mouth that is probably inexplicable, yet noticeable. An 7.5/10\n\n* Black Pepper Chicken and Garlic Rice, sold separately (father's main) - Hands down, the highlight of the day. Never have I tasted Black Pepper Chicken done so beautifully crafted in terms of flavor. And the Garlic Rice were \"actually\" Garlic Rice, not a joke in the name of garlic. You could just bring the bowl of rice close to your nostrils and know for a fact how nicely the garlic was incorporated in the rice. Father won, simple. Would definitely give 8.5/10\n\nWe ordered 3 drinks to go with the meal: Mint Julep, Blue Margarita, Peach *something*. In terms of the quantity of the drinks, father (Mint Julep) won again. Then mum (Peach *something) and then me. Again.\nThe experience, in terms of cozy sitting, soothing music being played in the background (rather than some pop/rap/hip-hop artist blaring) and most importantly, taste, was great. Definitely a place I'd go over and over again.\nThe only problem that I have is that the portions could be slightly bigger, because when you pay about Rs. 5000 for a meal of 3, you sort-of expect to be filled to the hilt. But it wasn't so. But it was 5000 bucks well-spent for taste. Definitely well-spent if \"taste\" was (and mostly, it is) meant to be the star. I would just say, if they could slightly beef up their quantity too, it'll do wonders.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-12T03:34:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-12T20:01:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1352533620","name":"Sakina Nanabhai"},{"id":"1088748635","name":"Aqsa Shah"},{"id":"1241948621","name":"Nayab Shakil"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"100002608457065","name":"Haroona Khawar"},{"id":"100001249191882","name":"Fozia Amjad"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"628495513","name":"Fariha Harris"},{"id":"617371190","name":"Samar Mughal"},{"id":"100001697508377","name":"Hira Qazi"},{"id":"550700453","name":"Ammar Amjad"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1202678003","name":"Aisha Naayaab Rao"},{"id":"614747510","name":"Tariq Hameed Siddiqui"},{"id":"100001419761223","name":"Imran Malik"},{"id":"756768261","name":"Muhammad Aslam"},{"id":"535065551","name":"Hassan Khan"},{"id":"789225723","name":"Lalarukh Khursheed Farooqui"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM4MjM2MTI1Ng\u003d\u003d","before":"NTA4OTIyNTA5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"648625911855229","from":{"name":"Sajjad Ahmed","id":"1382361256"},"message":"well described!thanks....but 5000 rupees too much!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-12T04:35:05+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"648630128521474","from":{"name":"Ehtesham Maqbool","id":"189100160"},"message":"Nice detailed review.

The words \"huge\", \"big\" or \"giant\" are an understatement. For Rs. 1500, one MAMMOTH size serving of Hot n Sour Soup, really beautiful Spicy Steamed Wantons (I can just have a hundred of them per day and not complain, and yes they're true to their name i.e. 'spicy'), another MAMMOTH size serving of American Chopsuey (they go overboard with the sauce/topping for the chopsuey; poora bowl bhar gaya tha with just the sauce, lol) and yet again, a MAMMOTH size serving of Egg Fried Rice with Szechuan Chicken.\nAll in all, absolutely wonderful experience. The food was steaming hot when it arrived, which was surprising (and pleasing) since I live in Gulistan-e-Jauhar and the rider managed to deliver the food piping hot. What I really loved was the fact that they were flexible enough to change the Fried Wantons (the actual part of the deal) to Spicy Steamed Wantons. Very few places left in K-Town that go flexible with their deals for the customer, let alone do it in the same price.\n\nP.S.

An ordinary one but less ordinary. more special in a way that it was filling.\n\nBacon Peperroni Jalapeno Pizza, 6/10 but upto the mark. maybe change the cheese topping. loved the crust though. fresh and crispy, this was a thin pan. \n\nTeriyaki Chicken, 5/10. big no from us. i think everyone just cannot do teriyaki. \n\nChicken Scallaponi, 8/10 this was my order. i dont remember much about this one, since i was busy tasting the others but i do remember that next time i goto monte cristo, i have to order one of these again.\n\nthe highlight of the night was the beef fillet, after such a long time, someone understood what medium rare is, and it was cooked to perfection. i was so happy to see it, that i forgot everything on the table. i found this to be so heavenly, i was almost envious why i did not order the fillet.

And that's the only thing that was lacking in that area. \n\nThe place it self is lovely, still not yet open so parts were being worked on. RED was the predominant color, in fact I don't think there was any other colour. But the sea was lovely the wood work solid and the full moon made the ambiance gorgeous. Yes it's very red, with lights, carpet chairs all red. But what is a Chinese without the red.\n\nThe food was limited since it was just an soft launch. But was good and each item tasted different. As the weather gets cooler the soups will become more popular. One tip thu the prawn crackers didn't survive the humidity - thu were fresh when came to the table....wilted almost instantly. Soups arrived hot and each one was different from the other. The chicken corn was actually great, the seafood coriander very nice and the hot & sour. Starters had steamed wontons and prawn tempura which I was happy to see, steamed wontons/dumplings (dimsum) is a fav and thank god becoming popular here too. The rice and noodles were both well seasoned and cooked well. In fact many commented how nice the rice was on its own. Chicken Schezuan was amazing as was the beef chili dry, and honey chicken with sesame (a little too sweet for my taste) the sticky sweet fish I don't like anywhere and this was no exception thu really liked the lemon fish. \n\nAll in all a good evening spent with great friends checking out a new place. We wish them all the best and hope that the few issues they were facing will be sorted out before the hungry crowds of discerning Karachiites arrive.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-19T06:01:40+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-20T18:17:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"724148371","name":"Rabia Hai"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"514292991","name":"Marium Hosein"},{"id":"547501074","name":"Rehana Naseer"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"522977702","name":"Sheikh Hasan Rasul"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"504517271","name":"Usman Tanzeel"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"622525326","name":"Mohsin E Azam"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"511301771","name":"Eefa Khalid"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI0NDc2NzM1","before":"NTg0NjgyMjQz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_620982761286211/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTI0NDc2NzM1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"620983104619510","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"The place does have a name but its not yet put up outside.

Ended up at Peking (this AWKWARD Chinese place at Bahadurabad) and I have been forced to share my review since i spent ...oh sorry wasted 1600 bucks. P.S the following pictures and reviews are about to notify serious competition to Golden Dragon, Red Emperor, Ginsoy and Chairman Mao....\nThe burger qaum (DHA/Clifton residents) is set to dine in at pricey places! Well long live all u eateries.....u guys charge for hygiene, standard and items mentioned on your menus!\n\nSo me and Shahroz Ali visited PEKING....the place was really really really shady but fully crowded with families since it was a sunday night. To my utter disappointed, the moment i opened the menu, my jaw dropped wide open! Nothing for less than Rs.500. Since i found it way to awkward (thinking i wud have rather bin to Red Emperor or Ginsoy for Chinese Dine in) i thought i'd place my order. We ordered 1 Chicken Fried Rice, 1 Lemon Chicken and 1 Hot n Sour Soup. The waiter told the servings were for 2 and my heart sank further. (so i was about to have 250 k sabzi chawal. 250 ka laal paani and nimboo murgi for 250! My hard earned Quaid e Azam :'( ) The order arrived within  15 mins while I kept observing the place. The trays they used were the steel ones used at burns road k tikkay wale....Neways this is what I got\n\nHot N Sour Soup. Simply liquid Ketchup, loaded with Hara Dhania (coriander) for God knows what reason\nLemon Chicken : Boiled chicken, cornflour in the stock as the gravy and literally half a litre lemon juice along with more lemon slices compared to the chicken\nChicken fried rice: Tasteless, completely raw veges\n\nHad a few bites and eventually got it all packed, since it got really late...ended up at Indus for Biryani! The portions were actually scanty and...v tried this place just for the heck of it.....Never Again\nFor all those who thought i can never criticize a place, here it it. I never post reviews about my bad experiences since if i just like to let go off being mean, but this place got my pukes stuck within my throat only!

Hakka Chinese with Mughal Decor.  Red Emperor is as much Hakka, as Ginsoy is Extreme.  The service was terribly slow, and there seemed absence of basic protocol.  Cutlery was missing (even though table was reserved in advance), the place ran out of napkins, no one bothered taking order for drinks (despite reminders), and it took at least twenty minutes before water was finally served (after repeated reminders).  \n\nSoup was served 30 minutes after the order was placed, while the rest of the dishes were served after a solid wait of 50 minutes.  Even then there were order mix-ups, and the staff just wasn't aware of what's happening.  And like always, the excuse was the typical old school one, 'sir aaj rush zyada hai...' -- fair enough.  \n\nThe food is typical Desi-fied Chinese, and hence it doesn't really have any distinct flavor.  Tried the Chicken Schezwan Soup, Fish in Tamarind Sauce, Mixed Fried Rice, Beef Chili Chowmein, and the Sichuan Chicken.  Nothing special about the flavor of any entree.  The serving sizes were massive, making it a favored choice for a value seeker.  With per head cost of roughly PKR500, Red Emperor is a pretty reasonable Desi Chinese option.\n\nThe service is a major bummer, and the food is just fine -- nothing special about it.  The place doesn't really have any differentiating factor, and is equally good (or bad) as Ginsory, or Jade Garden.\n\nNot recommended if one is looking for a smooth flavorful dinner experience.\n\nOverall Rating -- 6/10\n\nOn a side note -- the lightning at the place is just too dim, making going over the menu, and the bill, an arduous task.

However, despite our concerns, fate and some courage saw us at Oishi over the eid weekend. We started off with 12 pieces assorted sushi, the usual salmon, tuna, snapper, crabsticks, prawn, udon and the one curve ball, the eel. The fish was fresh and the sushi satisfactory, no complaints but Fujiyama is still the favorite. My wife and I were the only ones who wanted to try the eel, and I am glad we did, the eel sushi was extremely flavorful and I wished there was more. \n\nOver to the mains, two of us ordered the eid platter, one friend ordered beef teppanyaki, and another some chicken dish and I excitedly ordered the tempura udon. The eid platter included California rolls and 2 piece sushi, miso soup, tempura prawns/veggies and a surf & turf style teppanyaki. The rolls seemed a bit mayo heavy, the soup and the teppanyaki, however were done quite well. The tempura was done to perfection with a light, crispy batter accompanied by a delicious sweet chilli sauce. The friend with the chicken was not happy as the meat was overcooked and quite tough. As for me, well let?s just say it was completely not what I was expecting. The tempura udon is actually tempura prawns and veggies in miso soup along with udon noodles. This is a genuine Japanese dish and I am at fault for ordering without inquiring, but if there is one dish that stands against all my food beliefs, it?s this. I mean, you make perfectly good, crispy tempura, then, maybe out of hysteria at your own perfection, or fear or sheer madness you drown it in what is pretty decent miso soup, converting it into a soggy mess and destroying both in a single master-stroke. Then, you add egg noodles. I just couldn?t have it no matter what I told myself, each food has a purpose and it?s nobody?s business trying to mix and match. I shall restrain myself before I rant on, even though I slept wishing that someone would have added the word ?Soup? at the end of Tempura Udon (This is still NOT Oishi?s fault). Overall, Oishi was a mixed experience and based on the tough chicken, average sushi, serving size and price, would not visit again and would rather go to old favorites, Fujiyama. However, if I can?t find the eel I might come back for a taste and would definitely order the tempura prawns. I am not too picky about ambiance, a good one earns points but I don?t mind if a place isn?t overcrowded, smell, smoky or noisy. For those who care, Oishi has beautiful seating outside, however, the top floor where we sat was seemed clinical. Closing comments: Oishi is a hit and miss, try it as an alternative, just make sure you know what you?re ordering :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-14T18:01:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-15T04:48:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"670475299","name":"Amal Zehra"},{"id":"894105612","name":"Ahsan Areeb"},{"id":"514605350","name":"Ruquia Jawed-Hammad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE0NjA1MzUw","before":"NTE2NTgyNjY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"603198056398015","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Eel is available at Sakura sometimes.

Wonderful food! Service was a bit slow and there were a few mess ups with the food ordered, but that is understandable seeing as it's Eid and they were probably short on staff :)\nFor starters we ordered a Tomato and Olives Bruschetta. We ordered one, but they gave us two orders :p well, that doesn't matter because we quite enjoyed the starter as it was quite lovely. The soup was ordered was Tomato Soup. It was absolutely divine and creamy and just plain yumm.\nThe main courses were Grilled Chicken with Tarragon Sauce, Grilled Chicken with Mushroom Risotto and Spicy Japanese Chicken. My own main was the Tarragon Chicken and I loved it. Though I do wish there was a little more tarragon sauce. Either way, the chicken was cooked to perfection, the sauce delicious, as were the accompanying saut?ed veggies and mashed potatoes. My mom's main was the chicken with mushroom risotto and she loved her dish, as did I. I love mushrooms and i love risotto and I've found that not many restaurants can put the two together and make it taste divine, by Olivetto and Gon Pacci really do make a really tasty mushroom risotto. I didn't get to try more than a bite of the Spicy Japanese Chicken, that too at the very end, but what I tasted was quite lovely and perfectly spiced.\nOur drinks were a Hazelnut Frappe and an Affogato. Both were perfectly sweet, cold and refreshing, as they were meant to be. All in all, a wonderful fine dining experience!

Being a vegetarian most of my life, I usually avoided fast food and fried chicken, in leau of fresh salad and vegetables. I tried several restaurants but none were able to replicate that authentic western food feel with the garden aroma. \n\nI had decided since this morning that I'd be trying something new instead of my usual pick (Golden Dragon, Food centre, Mr. Burger) etc. Then I found this group called San-which? which was a food restaurant. The food looked good enough in the pictures but I was still not sure. I posted for reviews here and seeing that this \"San-which\" was approved by our big boss Nezihe Hussain, I gave it a shot. I ordered the greek salad through Urbanite at 8:15 pm, I was given a call at 9:45 pm that the rider had the wrong address and will be at my place in 20 minutes. The rider reached at 10:15 pm, apologizing and compensating me with a delicious Ice cream by Lal's. A good start ;)\n\nThe packaging and the presentation was perfect! As soon as I opened it, I could smell that similar garden aroma fragrance that was sweet tomato's key point gainer. I immediately realized the search is over. I've finally found the taste I had been looking for. Everything was perfect! The quantity, the quality, top class ingredients. It was just delicious. I could taste each and every ingredient that it consisted of, from the sun riped tomatoes to the black olives to the feta, that how different it was to the traditional stuff, how high quality it was compared to any other thing I have eaten recently, including subway or the traditional gyros.\n\nMy food experience of San-which: 9/10. I never give full marks because in my opinion there is always room for improvement, but this little outlet has just won my taste buds, and will surely be my go to place besides golden dragon from now ownwards.\n\nI usually never write such big reviews on food experiences unless its a bad one, or upload pictures of the food I am about to consume. Infact, I hate the habit. But this one deserves it.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-07-23T18:07:02+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-24T08:06:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1566590707","name":"Zainab Quli"},{"id":"100004102427163","name":"Malyha Shuja"},{"id":"100000126232501","name":"Habib Hashim Pal"},{"id":"628998190","name":"Shahvez Fazail"},{"id":"100001857259546","name":"Umer Awan"},{"id":"100000547472472","name":"Hasan Khan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1707529920","name":"Amna Tariq"},{"id":"612550201","name":"Muhammad Furqan"},{"id":"595581062","name":"Asma Saiyed"},{"id":"100005558611444","name":"Rana Arslan"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"602924593","name":"Aneeta Nasir"},{"id":"100000155371840","name":"Sabih Kirmani"},{"id":"520882045","name":"Ghulam Ali"},{"id":"1071636036","name":"Syeda Javeria Hassan"},{"id":"750786806","name":"Faixa Shah"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"584105847","name":"Sabin Jawed"},{"id":"586610094","name":"Sara Omar"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"100004544739993","name":"Anum Shafi"},{"id":"547996286","name":"Shahzaib Javaid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQ3OTk2Mjg2","before":"MTU2NjU5MDcwNw\u003d\u003d"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_591230300928124/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTQ3OTk2Mjg2"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"591230560928098","from":{"name":"Shahbaz Lalani","id":"100000311538556"},"message":"P.S Don't mind the bed sheet on the right side, I am too lazy to have my food on the dinner table.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T18:08:06+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591242360926918","from":{"name":"Zubair Azmat","id":"844086066"},"message":"How did you know about the food before consuming it that its worth taking a picture of. :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T18:42:09+0000","like_count":12,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591249600926194","from":{"name":"Faizan Mukarram","id":"1023815310"},"message":"It must have been the love at first sight wala scene :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T19:00:06+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591256954258792","from":{"name":"Shahbaz Lalani","id":"100000311538556"},"message":"Lol its a yahoodi sazish :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T19:23:30+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591259294258558","from":{"name":"Hafsa Azhar","id":"543845188"},"message":"^oppxxzz...!! :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T19:28:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591262827591538","from":{"name":"Anum Zainab","id":"100000073259186"},"message":"Me three :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T19:41:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591309677586853","from":{"name":"Mariam Lary","id":"1089603658"},"message":"where is this outlet?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T21:49:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591375824246905","from":{"name":"Mostafa Mo","id":"1684751893"},"message":"I Am Sorry But Is This A Niswaar Kii Puriyah Besides The Paper Glass ???","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T23:31:23+0000","like_count":9,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591419824242505","from":{"name":"Sania Lakhani","id":"1667656022"},"message":"^^LOL...I think it's chutney","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-24T01:06:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591474557570365","from":{"name":"Saroasha Eng","id":"508588993"},"message":"I loveeeeeee sweet tomatoes.

So we left from there and went to look for another restaurant in the same vicinity. Ended up at the sports bar in the basement of Kamamishi. The sports has been converted to cavaili lounge. It was a HORRIBLE experience. The place was gaudy and interior decorators nightmare. With red and purple lights and Cheetah print sofas it looked like a set from a B grade movie. Hunger made us stay and listen to kishore kumar weepy songs. We ordered corn soup, lemonatto drinks, beef tippenyaki, spicy chicken wrap and grilled chicken burger. Out of all the food the burger was eatable. Beef was cold and chewy. Wrap was dry. Soup was just starch. They served dinner when we threatened to leave after waiting for more then half an hour.

The difference tonight was Irfan Malik's presence, who thanks to his love for Turkish food, designed the spectacular menu! And my God, he's a genius! The star of the evening was Kar???k Pide clubbed with Doner.. in easier terms, it was Turkish Pizza overloaded with a very generous serving of juicy Doner beef. This merger of two separate items was an off-the-menu brainchild of my husband and wow, I was blown away! The pizza even without the extra meat was scrumptious and crispy! The slivers of doner beef were tender, juicy with just enough flavour. \nThe rest of the meal included Ezogelin Soup (lentil soup), Durum Doner (doner wrap), and Soslu Tavuk (which is quite like Chicken Shashlik). The soup was a bit bland but the sauces helped. Durum Doner has become a personal favourite of mine. Soslu Tavuk was fantastic, although it may be considered as an acquired taste since I'm quite sure some lamb fat goes into it to give it that authentic flavour. \nAll in all, a very scrumptious and fulfilling meal it was, and my love for SOLEN has increased manifold!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-28T20:45:28+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-30T02:57:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"100000510679894","name":"Kanwal Hafeez"},{"id":"780381887","name":"Samar Husain"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"704566421","name":"Zubair Uddin"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"707220178","name":"Zohra Rajpar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzA3MjIwMTc4","before":"NTAxNDE1NzE2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"529520373765784","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Irfan Malik I know who to take when Shaikh Fawad convinces me to go to DMC for the Turkish meal.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-29T05:42:36+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"632567679","name":"Irfan Malik","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad","type":"user","offset":36,"length":12}]},{"id":"529520460432442","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Saira Malik the pics look yum and incredibly tempting","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-29T05:43:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"529544690430019","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"Pide with donner... we used to do that too...

Special WOK Soup (white) is refreshingly different in taste from other special soups being offered by Chinese food outlets. Butterfly Prawns for starters were excellent. Prawns were of good size and just the right amount of batter. We were recommended fried fish with crumbs by the order taker (not in menu I guess) and although it's not really Chinese food but perhaps best fried fish you can have in Karachi. I requested for something in beef and was suggested Beef Bulgoki, another stellar dish which was adequately spiced, and meat was tender as compared to any normal Beef Dry Chilly. Thai Chowmein is also a great offering for people with taste for Chowmein, again a recommendation from the gentleman who took order. I found WOK great in terms of value for money as portions were generous (specially rice) and food arrived well in time (about 35 minutes, but then I live in Clifton) and in piping hot condition. Definitely a must try for Chinese food fans.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-20T07:12:40+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-20T07:12:40+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"656462656","name":"Mustafa Ahmed"},{"id":"585054134","name":"Helal Enver"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTg1MDU0MTM0","before":"NjU2NDYyNjU2"}}},"restaurantName":"Soup"},{"id":"165861103465048_522873424430479","from":{"name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed","id":"786471893"},"message":"Where exactly is Xander's and what all should be ordered there?

When we informed the waiter that it was cold - he offered to take it away only to zap it in the microwave which completely dried out the chicken breasts.

As per your recommendation, if I am naming it correctly, I ordered the Big Log Cheesy Beef Cheese Burger which was just D-I-V-I-N-E!! Sir, you just never disappoint us with the food. It was nostalgic having it as the taste just reminded of this one burger we used to have in our childhood. It was juicy, flavorsome and to add it all, it was HUGE and certainly did fulfill my appetite. We will definitely be dropping in next time to have the ?PAYAS?.

Not everyone on my table liked the different taste of it but I found it really yummy. A great break from the Hot n Sour soups I have had before. \nIt was a bit heavy so avoid having it much if you want to enjoy the actual food.\n\nChicken Lettuce Wraps-I liked the whole idea how they were served. Chicken, lettuce and the sauce, all three were served separately so you have to make your own wrap. It stays crunchier this way. Tastes great.\n\nHoney Glazed Beef Ribs-This was a hit. Everyone liked it. Beef was cooked to perfection and it tasted divine.\n\nWasabi Prawns-Loved the texture, the taste. A must try!\n\nSzechuan Chicken-It was one of the best Szechuan Chicken I have had so far. The sauce tasted really well.\n\nKung Pao Chicken- It had a very balanced taste. But I liked Szechuan over this\nChicken Chownmein-Yummy! cooked well. A must try for everyone who likes chowmein.\n\nOverall the experience was great and so was the service. The whole atmosphere was great too. It was pretty packed when I went so if you are planning to go then do get a reservation done.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-01T05:56:44+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-01T21:17:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575486349","name":"Amber Rizvi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"702746868","name":"Sharmeen Sharif"},{"id":"504176735","name":"Ali Farookh Rizvi"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"507400925","name":"Adil Mufti"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA3NDAwOTI1","before":"NTc1NDg2MzQ5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"466907550027067","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Or sit outdoors.

It was not the first time ordering but this time I would like to try something different. Placed my order directly with Qamarunnisa , specifically told her what I wanted and even the time for delivery. All was taken care of and at exactly 5pm, the rider came with the piping hot food. \n\nI ordered a meal for 3-4 people @ Rs 1250. It consisted of Chicken Corn Soup, Egg Fried Rice, Chicken Chowmien, Chicken Szechuan and Fried Wontons. They even gave me a complimentary steamed wontons :) Thank you! I baked a Chocolate Happy Birthday Cake recipe from Food Diaries Zarnak Sidhwa - and boy it was a really yummy cake! Everyone tasted it and now Im left with only a small slice of it. Thanks Zarnak!\n\nWe had all the dishes at 7pm and the food was still warm. Even though it was for 3-4 people but the whole family of 6 adults and 4 children (under 8yo) had a full meal and believe me, there is still some left. Really great value for money! \n\nEveryone commented the food was delicious & kids loved the soup! \n\nThank you to Golden Dragon & Qamarunnisa for the delicious food, everyone enjoyed it and happy to say that we are all Goldenzied :)","type":"photo","created_time":"2012-11-21T05:08:45+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-23T16:06:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"100001603784203","name":"Bilaval Qamar"},{"id":"575820034","name":"Maheen Kamran"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"100002785190370","name":"Vseem Gaved"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"1016847377","name":"Zartaj Mohmand"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"786471893","name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nzg2NDcxODkz","before":"MTAwMDAwNjg4MTgyNTAy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"462887963762359","from":{"name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed","id":"786471893"},"message":"The wontons look great!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-21T05:19:47+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"462924240425398","from":{"name":"Bushra Joyo","id":"1421223164"},"message":"I love GD food !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-21T07:51:22+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"463006203750535","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Need.To.Order.GD.Soon.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-21T13:49:35+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"463018913749264","from":{"name":"Zartaj Mohmand","id":"1016847377"},"message":"Golden Dragon and Zarnak Sidwa never disappoint:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-21T14:28:31+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"463019223749233","from":{"name":"Ezwana R-Zaman","id":"701414399"},"message":"Zartaj Mohmand - totally agree on that! now waiting for an occasion to try our your yummy breads!! :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-21T14:29:14+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"463020930415729","from":{"name":"Zartaj Mohmand","id":"1016847377"},"message":"Anytime dear:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-21T14:34:34+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"463446603706495","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Thanks Ezwana!!!!

The kids loved it!\nPaneer Reshmi Handi.. Delicious, but a tad bit over-rated. Honestly speaking, it tasted just like pasta in white sauce sans the pasta! This was pointed out by my 7-year old, and after that I had a hard time eating it with naan. :/\nSeekh Kababs, Behari Chicken Boneless, and Malai Tikka.. all were good but I've had better! Malai tikka was slightly undercooked. (Seriously!!)\nGarlic naans: the first two were dry and hard, the third one was soft and fluffy (since we had complained about the first batch) and then the fourth one was again like the first two.  \n\nAll food was delivered hot and fresh (barring the naans), and stayed so despite the open air seating. The floor manager was very interested in our feedback and we did point out the shortcomings. \n\nI wouldn't mind going to Kolachi again for its serene and magical surroundings.

After picking Saffron as our second choice, we ordered clear vegetable soup, avocado and prawn salad, mediterranean chicken, shishtaouk chicken. Soup and salad arrived after waiting for quite some time but that wasn't too long plus a complimentary starter platter with hummus crackers and vegetables was served, hummus was good. Soup was good but salad was an absolute winner, loved it and won't mind going back just for the salad. I had shishtaouk for main, chicken was tender and flavourful and rice it was served with had a nice arabic flavour, though chicken was a little too spiced up. mediterranean chicken had a good flavour too but the chicken fillet i tasted wasn't tender at all, it was hard and chewy, so i mentioned it to the floor manager and he apologetically offered to replace it, but we declined as we were full by then. So the dining experience that started beautifully with that perfect salad ended not so perfectly due to badly cooked chicken. But so far so good as we were already offered a replacement which we declined ourselves. Then the bill arrived, and they charged us for mains ordered by the table next to us(it was server's fault) so it had to be rectified and then we were sent a bill for the items that we ordered. But again there was a mistake as some items were billed higher than they were listed on the menu(that had something to do with software not being updated as per menu prices). So that had to be corrected as well. Overall the staff showed courtesy to fix all the issues and apologized appropriately(though after so many hiccups in one night, there should be something complimentary offered LOL, greedy me). And all that made the overall experience rather average what could have been something much better. Not rushing back anytime soon.. And yes Patio here we come(soon)!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-24T12:21:49+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-24T12:21:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"764425006","name":"Alisa Zulfiqar Zuberi"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTgyOTYwNTc1","before":"NzY0NDI1MDA2"}}},"restaurantName":"Soup"},{"id":"165861103465048_414880538563102","from":{"name":"Saira Malik","id":"1133719630"},"message":"Forty4, I am in awe!! and I am sad too! In awe of your superb lunch deals that we tried today, and sad because we did not try them earlier!! \n\nThe three course lunch deals with mocktails at Rs 644 + tax are actually too good to be true. Although I wanted to sample some of the strongly SWOT-recommended entrees, one glance at the deals, and I decided we were all going for them. And am I glad that we did! \n\nNot only was the food scrumptious to the core, the portions were more than ample. (we were quite skeptical about the portion sizes.) I took the Seafood deal and Irfan opted for the Beef deal while our daughters shared the Pasta deal. \n\nSo here's what came to our table: \nStarters: \n  Hot & Sour Soup: tangy, fragrant and flavourful. Loved it!\n  Som Tam (papaya salad): fresh, crunchy and fiery. just as I like it!\n  Chilli Honey Glazed Wings: the quantity (five wings) was impressive, taste was a little ketchup-y but it fared well with the girls. \n\nEntrees:\n   Wok Fried Beef with basil chilli oyster sauce served with steamed rice: Verrry generous portion, scrumptious, a tad bit less flavourful than Fuchsia's. \n   Tamarind Chilli Fish with Basil served with rice: Thank God for the separately served tamarind sauce!! The lightly battered fish was very crisp and did not turn soggy as it usually does after being doused with the sauce. \n   Fettuccine Alfredo: Looked awesome. and the girls polished it off! \n\nDesserts:\n   Bread & butter pudding with ice cream: ohmygodthatwastoogood!! I am definitely going to be dreaming about it for days to come!\n   Chocolate Molten Lava Cake served with ice cream: The chocolate was not strong enough, although the cake was very moist. Ice cream was awfully crystallized. \n\nDrinks:\n   Pina Colada, Lemon Margarita, and Fresh Lime with 7-up: All good!\n\nNeedless to say, we were stuffed beyond imagination! The place is lovely and very pleasant. The seating is highly comfortable. The outdoor patio is such a romantic spot. :)\nThe servers were very courteous and prompt. However, somehow our server was not knowledgeable enough about the lunch deals. He missed our drinks totally and was kind of puzzled when we asked about them. So the drinks arrived after we were done with our main course. But this was the only hiccup in our otherwise absolutely fantastic dining experience.

The place has 180 seats at three different levels inc a lounge. We started off with Roasted Tomato and Broccoli Soup, for starters we had Spinach and Artichoke Dip, were also served complimentary bread basket, warm and fresh bread, the Soup was good topped with goat's cheese and well flavored. Main course comprised of Kalamata Chicken ? Marinated chicken with kalamata, green olives and sun-dried tomatoes and \nGrilled Fillet of Chicken with Rocket Grilled chicken topped with rocket leaves drizzled in delicate garlic olive served with Saut?ed mushrooms and vegetable timbale. The food was served hot and excellent presentation but the meat needed to be a tad bit more tender. For drinks we had Falsa Juice less sugar, a bit sour but authentic not artificial in flavor. Last but not the least desert was Warm Apple crumble with Ice cream, baked apple pie was a bit hard and required an effort to break but combined with Ice cream was delicious. Service was excellent, staff was polite, attentive and the manager was kind enough to ask us \"How was your meal\". One of the reasons for me to swot this place was to have an objective analysis as to how well team Aylanto is performing! after reading many negative reviews and not many reviews these days, Aylanto finally seems to be on track now, after weathering the storms, as the place was packed with people and they kept coming and coming till about 2:15 pm......which means they are delivering on quality of service.....only one thing seriously needs to be looked into, that is when the bill was presented it was simply on a piece paper with GST being charged at 16% and no proper bill was given with a valid GST no. The server was called and he gave the excuse that the machine was out of order, then the manager was summoned and he gave the excuse that the accountant is not present, and if we need the proper bill we will have to wait, as it will take HALF AND HOUR, then he under took the responsibility to have the bill delivered to our give address, we advised him to make it, scan it, and email it us, he committed he would do so, but unfortunately even after a passage of three hours when I write these lines no proper bill has been emailed. Cafe Aylanto which is one of the most prestigious and respected restaurants in Karachi, has done very well on all counts accept this one. This is a serious matter which they need to investigate and get back asap. If I am being charged GST, it is my right as a customer to insure that it is being accounted for in the proper manner, and not only charged, but accounted for and deposited in the respective gop account. This is not an allegation but an observation, early also they presented a bill which was on a piece of paper and not a properly printed one with GST no, complaint lodged and no action was taken which does not reflect well on this establishment. I am sure someone would like to clarify this issue.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-19T12:49:46+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-19T12:49:46+0000","restaurantName":"Soup"},{"id":"165861103465048_413910038660152","from":{"name":"Aamna Saiyid","id":"565939122"},"message":"For their 26th wedding anniversary, my parents decided to go to Cafe Blue Ginger tonight.

Golden Dragon - My new love for Thai and Chinese food. Hot favourites: American Chopsuey, Crispy Beef, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Hot and Sour Soup, Thai Soup, Thai Green Curry, Wontons, Zingers and Chicken Karhai (the last two from their Lunch Xpress section)\n\n2. Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb's warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I'm not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away. Will go soon to be blown away by other things too.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-25T18:59:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-27T14:47:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"505164013","name":"Yasmeen Agad-Kothawala"},{"id":"515396294","name":"Danish Ali Dahraj"},{"id":"100003249618202","name":"Heer Ahmed"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"500907007","name":"Murtaza Moiz"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNjUxNzIy","before":"NjU3MDMxNzQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"404073356310487","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"i see myself featured here too, obliged and humbled Hajra Amir","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T19:33:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir","type":"user","offset":52,"length":10}]},{"id":"404123489638807","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Thank you Hajra :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T21:13:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra","type":"user","offset":10,"length":5}]},{"id":"404386042945885","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"These places are on my fingertips 24/7!!!

After being more than highly disappointed in the food at Baan Thai and Royal Elephant(at P.C), a friend & I decided to dine at Fuchsia for lunch today. My previous post on SWOT was about recommendations so as to make the dining experience worthwhile. A thanks goes out to all of you for taking out the time & putting in efforts (in the form of comments on that post) to provide recommendations & assist me in making valuable selections from the menu at the aforementioned restaurant.\n\nAt the entrance, we were given a warm welcome by the smiling staff who upon checking with our preference, lead us to our table on the ground floor, in the non-smoking area. Since it was a weekday, not too many diners had crowded the floor. Unlike many people out there, I like to eat at peace & do not prefer over crowded &/or noisy eateries. After finding ourselves comfortably seated at a corner table, our order for appetizers, main course & beverages was taken by a cooperative & friendly waiter. We ordered the Creamy Coconut Soup with straw mushroom & lime leaf. An assortment of add-on spices and sauces were served to spice it up according to our taste. For main course we ordered  Red Snapper with chilli tamarind oyster sauce & Red Curry Chicken with bamboo shoots and sweet basil. While we were enjoying the flavour packed soup, a group of 4 kittie party aunties arrived & were seated on the table for 8, next to our's. They hadn't even properly greeted eachother when the rat race of fashion & who-spent-how-much-on-which-nail-salon-this-week gossip began. Their gossip or the topic of discussion was none of my business ofcourse, had they not turned their get together into a fashion expenditure war when one of the wannabe girl-aunty started to boast 'n' brag soooo loudly that I had to request the staff to move us elsewhere & escape from that material-war in process before their remaining guests arrived. Yes I was expecting atleast a few ounces of speaking etiquettes & decent body language from them.\n In no time, we were shifted in the smoking area upstairs, since the stuck-up group had the entire restaurant involuntarily all ears to them. The staff didnot become annoyed with my request & infact, very happily served our meal at the new table. Our main course was served in a matter of only ten to fifteen minutes of placing the order.\n\nThe  red curry (with  rice) was divine, flavoursome, and wow! However, the fish failed to impress us. It was too stiff (not crisp), lacked freshness, was dry to the core & not actually something I would order next time or recommend to anyone. I didnot ask for a replacement or complain about it because I  tried it for the first time at this restaurant & felt maybe it was meant to look & taste like it did. When offered to fill out the comment card, I did provide a written honest feedback  about the fish not to be at par with my expectations/ liking. I felt that would suffice, along with complementing on the things I liked about Fuchsia.\n\nRestaurant  ambience was pleasant, staff were clad in smart,  clean uniforms, were very attentive & alert to the needs of diners & order timeliness was observed to be quite impressive!\n\nOverall a great experience! I look forward to visiting Fuchsia again to devour in the various other specialities of the 'loved' place.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-19T16:28:49+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-20T13:10:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzkyNDcwMTcw","before":"NjI1OTY4OTUz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"400766493307840","from":{"name":"Rabiya Syed","id":"1453901313"},"message":"You should have requested a replacement for the fish  immediately.Its normally very succulent,crisp on outside but really soft inside and its sauce is absolutely delicious!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-19T23:51:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400856599965496","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"Fuschia is one of my favouritist places ever!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T03:52:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400948083289681","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"@Rabiya Syed I thot of doing that first, then I thot shayad aisi hi hoti hogi, so didn't bother","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T09:36:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400948269956329","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"@Charmaine u were correct, the red curry was actually to die for!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T09:37:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401016543282835","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"I told you!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T13:10:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDAxMDE2NTQzMjgyODM1","before":"NDAwNzY2NDkzMzA3ODQw"}}},"restaurantName":"Soup"},{"id":"165861103465048_400084836709339","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"So finally couldnt wait for the night and ordered Chinese from Golden Dragon.

The best thing about Gunsmoke was even though it is located in a mall, in no way it gave one the feeling... It is an entity on its own... Overall a brilliant experience, Thank You AC :)\n\np.s: AC's burger in the french 'baguette like bun' was a totally different ball game :) would recommend it highly to people who want to be adventurous with their burgers :) (I Know I would next time that I am there)\n***********************************************************\nAmbareen Khan\nDear fellow swotties..I was on the table next to yours during the Gun Smoke food tasting today. Must say I agree in most part with your reviews. However there were some issues I pointed out. Firstly the cheese nachos were too 'processed' for my taste. They were simply spicy doritos covered in canned cheese dip and salsa. I was told that corn chips were not available locally(??) and therefore they had to stick to doritos. Secondly all of us ordered our burgers with the orginal bun which I feel does not do the juicy burger justice. Again I was told that Dawn is the only option so choice is limited. Salads, a few of them like the eggplant tomato was outstanding, wheras the pasta salad lacked oomph. However would I go again? Most certainly because I feel Gun Smoke will be ironing out minor glitches in no time and will live up to expectations set in part ,but obviously not solely,by its amazing ambience...\n***********************************************************\nAdnaan Chaudhary\nGun Smoke. Perfect wings. Grilled to perfection. The grilled prawn cocktail is divine. The burger in the french baguette bun was awesome. Head grill master personally delivered. Soup was great. Salad bar needs tweaking. Service still rough around the edges. But for day one it was miles ahead of any newbie joint. Prices equate value for money. Harris and kamran sheikh. Your Genesis is standing proud and tall. Bravissimo.\n***********************************************************\nNezihe Hussain\nWhat a day. Strike, heat, humidity all combined couldnt take away the wonderful time spent with fellow swotties....lovers of food. Many a noble bovine race sacrificed their lives for todays gastronomy of protiens.\n\nAt the SWOT Opening (soft) for GUNSMOKES latest venture at Dolmen Mall Clifton, met up to sample their menu and service.\n\nThe place has a fun feel. Perfectly chilled in this weather it was a pleasure to walk into the vibrant alive place.\n\nGun Smoke is synonymous with \"hutke\" \"something different\" and they have lived up to their promise.\n\nThe food thu limitedmin option today since it was a soft opening was really good. The burgers amazing. But i resent the favoritism being shown to lumboo when he got the french baguette bun and i got the regular soft bun.\n\nThe wings thu grilled and not crispy (as i like it) were cooked to perfection and yum. The nachos on the other had were doritos (not nice) the grilled prawns on a stick were perfection and i think even the BOTS spy got some tips.\n\nA place to head to on a hot Karachi summer or just for a bite of something yum. Guns are surely Smoking this time.\n\nWell done Kamran Sheikh and team.\n\nThank you Adnaan Chaudhary for arranging the lunch.\n***********************************************************\nShaikh Fawad\nGuess u guys heard Huh??? Yeah we went to Gun Smoke's- DollmenCity soft VIP opening courtesy AC. Felt a bit superstarish walking in as a line of envious eyes watched in jealousy? or may be in just hunger, as it was Lunch time, and the smell of a burger grill may have been more of a reason for wide&wild-open-eyes than the long list of SWOT celebrities : P.... anyWho, here are the dirty details:\nMuniza and I started w/ the soup and salad. Thought the flavors of the fresh&gr8 ingredients would have been enhanced if more seasoning was applied, but a dash of salt did the trick there:)\nNachos: I really didn?t think that classic Doritos could make such gr8 Nacho?s?talk about authentic : P ? wings were gr8 & perfectly succulent but I prefer both crispy on the outside & succulent on the LogINN,) side.\nBurger: I had the Mushroom Cheese, which was awesome!!! I could tell the cooking- time was something they take into consideration, as I had a perfectly cooked patty that was soft to bite in to : ))))))))))))))))) Muniza had the Pesto Burger & from what she told me it was also excellent :)\nI personally like thick home fries, but the perfectly crispy, skinny ones offered were piping hot, and only needed a dash of salt too make it deliciously savory.\nI thought the falsay drink was fantastic, so was the mint drink, but the former won my heart, as it wasn?t too sugary yet tasted natural and very refreshing!!!\nAll?n all, a gr8 opening!!! congrats Harris, and Kamran on yet another franchise : )\n***********************************************************\nHussain Tariq\nWent on the soft opening of Gun and Smoke on the invitation of Adnaan Chaudhary - Found the place extremely welcoming and lively!! of course had the company of amazing swotties Nezihe Hussain, Shaikh Fawad his lovely wife, Ally Aadil Bhamani Ryeaan Anwar Chaudhary Luciferz Angel and many many more... since it was a soft launch so few hiccups were expected but service was perfectly fine!! Tried a spoon full of doritos in Jalapeno dip (guess they were not served as Nachos) the dip / dressing was spicy and nice..wings were nice crispy and had amazing spicy tinge to them...and for the main course had a Jalapeno burger - the meat was perfectly char grilled and burger was good though bit crumby from the top but like always I remove the soggy part the one that has extra cheese and sauce and have my patty with the top part because it is always crispier so ended up enjoying my burger a lot! The mint lemonade was little over sweet but perfect, perhaps that is how it should be if not specified otherwise! My son would be a regular there because he is a huge burger fan!! The best part about the place is its location though its part of the mall and yet its away from the madding crowd..so one does not feel that he is sitting in a mall with crowd staring at you from everywhere!! All in all a very good experience!!\n***********************************************************","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T16:27:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-14T10:19:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"711705428","name":"Basit Nasir Ahmed"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"643423090","name":"Junaid Zuberi"},{"id":"592813967","name":"Umme Hamdani"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcwMTAwMTk4","before":"MTAwMDAyOTY3NTA0MTU5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397349016982921","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Luciferz Angel Ambareen Khan Nezihe Hussain Adnaan Chaudhary Hussain Tariq Shaikh Fawad Najam Quddusi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T16:31:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14},{"id":"676177213","name":"Ambareen Khan","type":"user","offset":15,"length":13},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain","type":"user","offset":29,"length":14},{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","type":"user","offset":44,"length":16},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq","type":"user","offset":61,"length":13},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi","type":"user","offset":88,"length":13}]},{"id":"397349063649583","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"thanks","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T16:31:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"397352813649208","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Raheel.

Enough said!\n\nTutti fruti Froyo: I love the fact that they keep bringing in new flavors every week. So far, my favourites have been lychee and peach\nBreakfast at Xanders: Tried their soft scrambled eggs, Xanders Club Sandwich, berry daiquiri and strawberry smoothie?absolutely loved the sandwich! I just wish they had pizza in the mornings too. I can have their pizza at all times of the day!\n\nKolachi:  Had heard alot about their makhani handi?taste was alright but left me feeling too heavy?could not have more than a few bites. I really liked the nachos there! The service there deserves special mention. I would definitely go there again.\n\nA One Rolls: Though I used to love the rolls there as compared to eaton, hot and spicy and other roll places, the past couple of times when I went there, the rolls were soggy and extremely oily. \n\nCup a Soup Chicken Laksa at Aghas: I was very hungry (starving actually lol) when I had it and really liked the lemony coconut soup. Would have preferred if it was just a tiny bit more on the sour side as that is the way I?ve had it in Malaysia. A little more punch can make it really Wow! Btw I tried to make it my way at home the next day (just added a little extra imlee ka pani) and it was fabulous!\n\nButlers for lunch today:  Turkey Club Sandwich was good to taste?however, it was falling apart and not too easy to manage. I did not try the spicy chicken sandwich and Butlers Club Sandwich but my friends seemed satisfied with them. The chocolate decadence and hazelnut dessert (oops forgot the name but the dessert itself was pretty forgettable :S!) were fine. I guess I wasn?t in the mood for sweets. \n\nOh I also attended a dinner event at Marriot.

After consulting with Qamarunnisa Asim and Asim Mohammad Ali, we ordered Fish Cakes, Prawns in Red Curry, Chicken in Green Curry, Beef with Tamarind & Chillies and Steamed Rice. Everything was superb. Intensely flavoured and fragrant.. Tasted splendid and all made for an exotic meal. The only minor change that I'd like to suggest is in the size of the prawns in the red curry.. These were very tiny, albeit abundant.. The rest was perfect and relished by my entire family!

Was advised on the phone to make it 8:30 to which I showed my inability so they very kindly acceded to my request to accommodate us at 9:00 for which I am extremely grateful to the management of CK.  reached at 8:50 pm to find the restaurant empty but soon other customers started to arrive and by the time we left at around 10:00 the place was still half empty (CK management, why was I asked to make my reservation 8:30 instead of 9:00 when the restaurant was not booked to full capacity?) the servers were very courteous and the food didn't take much time to arrive at the table - 10/10 for service. Starters - Hot & Sour Soup - was liked by all 4 of us but it was a bit too sour, would taste even better if the vinegar is put on hold, Wasabi Prawns - 4 decent sized prawns fried and coated in wasabi/creamy white sauce served luke warm and Crab Rangoon - creamy crab meat wontons served cold - 6/10 for starters.  Main courses, Mu Shu Chicken - DIY paper thin pancakes served separately with chicken qeema and a black sauce - very desi stuff, Kung Pao Chicken - chunks of boneless chicken in red sauce with veggies and cashew nuts which were liked by all, Beef Steak - chunks of beef with veggies in black sauce, again liked by all, egg fried rice and chicken chowmein (very salty with excessive use of soy sauce with hardly any chicken meat in it) - 7/10 for main courses.  Prices reduced since my earlier visit and quantities much improved, the above order would suffice 5 persons easily. Total damage approx 5K inclusive of soft drinks and 16% GST.

Moreover, the service was very prompt and we were well looked after. I would've however liked more Spanish/Mexican/Italian music as it would've gone better with the setting. \n\nWe were first served with a complimentary basket of garlic bread, which was fresh and hot! In starters, ordered mushroom soup and the fried basket. Soup (although hot) was just so - so but the fried basket (comprising of chicken strips, fries, dip) was nice!\n\nIn the main course had grilled fish (my dad really liked this), chicken tarragon and beef tarragon. Everyone liked their dishes, the only thing I feel that could be improved upon is the serving size (which I felt was small). For drinks we ordered the mint lemonade which was very refreshing and is highly recommended. \n\nThe highlight was the Mother's Day deal which made my mum's entree and lemonade on the house and she was very happy! Good experience overall, will be going there again to try their signature dishes :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-13T17:47:04+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-13T19:55:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"537275209","name":"Faisal Iftikhar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTM3Mjc1MjA5","before":"NTEyMDkxMjYx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"378479772203179","from":{"name":"Sarah Ashraf","id":"643405172"},"message":"Wow.

Blue Ginger yesterday with Jasmine . . .\n\nThe ambience , the rococo styled interior and the way walls that qualify as  individual pieces of art that have been delicately put together to hold their own amongst all the hospitality that fills in this little place , it all looked great .\n\nAs soon as we entered , we were cordially greeted by the manager and ushered to my favorite table (the farthest one on the left)\n\nThe Bread Basket was as usual at it?s freshest best and with all those zesty condiments and sauces , it set the mood just perfect for the mother-son duo .\nThe Cream of Chicken Soup reached us piping hot and it was denser in consistency then the last time and trust me on that it changed for good , the grilled chicken chunks added to the flavor too .\nThe Grilled Chicken in Grain Mustard sauce , well here comes a creation that demands rather commands to be eaten with utmost care so that one can actually savour the taste of it and with the mashed potatoes (better than what?s served at many a places) it makes up for a filling and satisfying experience .\nThe CBG burger , that we ordered was accompanied with hot and crispy French fries and Coleslaw . The burger went well with my palate and it had that distinctive aroma of char-grilled beef patty ; my only pet peeve was the assembly , may be the bun (which I?d admit was fresh) could have been a tad bit smaller , but all in all it was scrumptious and I enjoyed every bite of it .\nThe Cr?me Brulee qualifies as the most favorite dessert as per the standards of my na?ve and humble palate , It looks gorgeous rather ravishing with all that detailing in the way it is presented ; add to it , it?s just the right amount I would fancy considering how highly spissated it is with those calories (change the topic already !)\nBurnt Caramel Custard is yet again a dessert that holds on to it?s roots , perfect with the pristine and rich flavor of burnt caramel in every bite , it?s just awesome . . .\n\nThe service , well if my memory is serving me right , the manager was kind enough to visit us thrice to make sure if everything was going fine or not . Our waiter (prefer naming people but then don?t know the name as it wasn?t mentioned the way it usually is) was courteous, attentive and the fact that he was enjoying serving food to us and many others around was apparent from his body language.\n\nA little pet peeve of mine would be the size of the tables , had they been a little bigger . . . but then it gets nullified as long as the food that lands on them is perfection personified .\n\nSeeing the ever fastidious Jasmine enjoying her food was in itself an amazing experience and then she declaring the fact that if there?s one place she?d like to enjoy her Mother?s Day treat it has to be CBG ; it very well was a testimony to the culinary expertise that the team CBG embodies . From the time when we entered till the time we left , we felt being taken care of , and that?s the best an eatery can provide it?s customers with . Having said that , not to forget the ambrosial food that comes along with all that care ..\n\nThank you Mr Hussain Tariq . . . :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-11T22:16:49+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-12T05:20:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"646818624","name":"Qazi Tauseef Uddin Ahmed"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ2NjY0NTM4","before":"ODM0MjcwMDY0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"377507792300377","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Why does Afroza and hussain always like each others posts.

I had opted the deal for three with Hot and Sour Soup which was very ketchupy and not at all thick the way soup should be, the wantons were good, the Chicken chilly vegetable had very little chicken and predominantly more of raw and uncut vegetables which should have been finally chopped, they refused me Chicken fried rice and instead gave me Garlic rice which was under cooked (Katcha) and had a funny smell in it. The need to work on their rice and cook it properly so it retains its flavor and is soft not hard and dry. Last but not the least the Chicken Chowmein noodles were also undercooked and could be much better in quality. I agree the helping was good but its no use if they cannot maintain the quality and match flavor and taste of the competitors.

The sleepy little nook of a restaurant in Zamzama (are there truly any other types) is still a quiet eatery and almost seems forgotten. Thyme has probably managed on its loyal clientele. \nI revisited the restaurant on a whim and found that it was still a delightful little place that has managed to serve good, though not exceptional, food. We started the meal with Couscous Salad with fried eggplant chips and Clear Chicken Soup with vegetables. The salad was a little bland and could have done with a drizzle of olive oil but it was a good start to the meal though the eggplant chips were a great touch. The Chicken Soup was also good but lacked the umami body usually associated with chicken soup in general as a comfort food; the chicken and vegetables were nice. For the main course we had the Tuscany Beef Fillet and Citrus Prawns which were as good as they sound and thankfully cooked well and not tough in texture. Surprisingly the roasted balsamic garlic served with the bread basket was what we enjoyed the most! Sweet, juicy garlic on not so fresh bread but we didn't mind eating it raw. \nIf Thyme concentrated on the little flourishes and added them to the menu as a whole I think the restaurant would be packed.\nRating: 3 out of 5\nHave you been to Thyme and what were your thoughts? Will you be giving it a go?","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-20T09:09:56+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-20T14:41:19+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"281021845282306","from":{"name":"Ahmed Shahnawaz","id":"100000759794024"},"message":"i am quite a thyme customer,have visited it often,i do like the food very much but i always find it empty,don't know why i know the owner as well,and i often ask him why is it empty,and says it happens,but it is a nice cosy place to eat","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T09:18:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281022635282227","from":{"name":"Omer Sattar","id":"100001643122805"},"message":"i go there often..  i really like the food","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T09:22:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281022945282196","from":{"name":"Sana Adnan","id":"891395441"},"message":"I love it too.

Perfect weather and time of day for a leisurely stroll up and down the broadwalk. Decided on the Aylanto Bistro, drawn by its very mod glass facade. Scanning the Menu kept outside when joined by young and intrusive waiter who insisted on giving me a running commentary, having come to the conclusion no doubt that I was faking it and looked like the type who couldn't read. Even more offensive was his casual 'hands in the pocket' manner. Anyway, ordered Shrimp Vegetable Soup-of-the-day. Excellent. Followed it up with a Classic Beef Burger. Thick juicy pattie, and all going well until encountered unchewable bits in the pattie testifying to the presence of 'charbi' in the mincemeat. Terrible! and very irritating having to spit it out. French fries scored passing grade, but the thick creamy white sauce in the burger interfered with the taste of the pattie, and kept it slipping in between the buns at crunch time. Smart, well appointed and clean toilet. But there were issues with the Menu comprising black fonts on dark blue background making for a difficult reading proposition. Black fonts on white backgrounds please. Keep it simple. Also, your printer needs a new cartridge. Could barely make out the bill. And now that you have a view of the Creek, its time to clean up the Creek.
