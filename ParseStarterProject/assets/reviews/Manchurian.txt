Prompt on time serving, extremely courteous waiters and to my surprise they were trained in english. The service made my day.  \n\nOk secondly a big WOW to the person who created the ambiance of that place. It looked and felt spectacular.\nAll red and really cozy. The upper decks had an even better feel.\nI award it the best looking restaurant at do darya *if there is such an award*\n\nI bounced around on all three decks and 3 different spots after finally deciding to settle down on the very first one :p. *salutes their level of patience*\n\nOk now food..\nOrdered chicken corn soup for starters, chicken fried rice, chicken manchurian and chicken chilli noodles.\n\nSoups:\nThick creamy with lots of corn that is exactly how i like my soup and that is exactly what i got.  So thumbs up.\n\nChicken Manchurian:\nI am the self proclaimed queen of manchurian lol and after searching through half the city i have finally found my manchurian spot !! It tasted spot on. Had the perfect hit of tanginess and the sweet and sour ka combo. One spoonful and i was dancing with the fishes. *moment of pure joyy*\n\nChicken Chilli Noodles:\nI just had a taste of them since im not a noodle person but my friend who is a freak o noodle enjoyed them enough to chow down the whole bowl. *they gotta be good*\n\nFried Rice:\n10/10 \n\nOverall:\nWith the total being around 2k with drinks i give it a yes for value for money.\nLoved the food and i learned its only their soft launch ka phase.

Though it was more on the spicy side for me.\n\nI did not try the other one but according to another fellow swottie it was also quite good.\n\nStarters:\nFor starters we had Chicken Drumsticks, Prawn balls and Prawn Toast.\nThe starters were cold initially but after requesting them to change it we were served with fresh hot ones. \nPrawn toast was a personal favorite .\nI found the prawn balls to be quite bland.\nThey being cold ruined the taste for me a bit.\n\nMains:\nFor Mains there was\nChicken Manchurian:\nMy much raved about personal favorite. Was a Disappointment at RE. The CM lacked gravy and was quite dry and too sweet. But had generous amounts of chicken. It was more of a mashed mush rather then a saucy Manchurian.\n\nBeef in Oyester Sauce:\nDefiantly got me going back for more. Was super yum soft and moist. Bit on the oily side though.\n\nVegetable in Coconut Curry:\nTasted okayish. The veggies were cut quite large making it hard to eat.\nThe coconut curry was an interesting blend of flavors though.\n\nVegetable Chowmein:\nAgain I found it quite bland. Nothing to write about.\n\nThere was one more dish I'm forgetting.\n\nDesserts:\nThere was 5 kinds of desserts \nChocolate moose. Cheesecake \nCustard. Fruit chat. Walnut muffins.\n\nThe cheesecake was loved by everyone.\nI personally loved the chocolate moose.\n\nFRUIT CHAT on a Chinese buffet. Like seriously bhai kia chah rahay ho. Iftari thori hai :P \n\nOverall:\nHad an amazing time meeting up with the people who share the similar love for food. \nThe food was quite cold would have appreciated warmer servings.\nFor taste I would give it a 6/10\nChoice of dishes 5/10\n\nService on the other hand was exceptionally good.\nMeeting the owners themselves was quite pleasent.\nLoved our complimentey cups of greentea.\n\nPriced at 1100 per person.

How thin, how thick & what shape to cut the food will produce a different effect on eating,the Beef Chilli,prawn tempura and the fried prawn balls main characteristic was their weak,thread-like shape.Both the prawn dishes were heavily coated in layers upon layers of batter and literally the taste,and the prawn content, of each was,non- distinguishable.we were hoping for a Deep-fried, crisp, fluffy batter surrounding juicy, perfectly cooked prawns.The deep fried prawns ?tempura,? and the fried prawn balls were most similar.\n Stir-fried meats are often seared prior to stir-frying, creating sauces and dishes that exude comfort and this is exactly something I couldnt find tonight. Their signature Popular dishes from be it in beef or chicken swimming in spicy sauces , or their hot crispy fish or their fun and fresh sushi ordered in the lazy,mindless TV hogging state failed to create a meal for us and dissapointing the consummate Chairman mao fan.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-11-01T23:39:33+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-01T23:39:33+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100003698171140","name":"Asra Mushtaq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAzNjk4MTcxMTQw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"picture":"http://photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/602122_316466355162407_2129422081_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d316466355162407&set\u003dpcb.643599412357879&type\u003d1&relevant_count\u003d3","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif","restaurantName":"Manchurian"},{"id":"165861103465048_640494456001708","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"Anyone tried the new Chinese place at Do Darya?

Sadly the line was HUGE & I was starving.\n\nEnded up at China Grill.. ordered the deal for 4 people and we were just two (i have no idea what I was.thinking)\nWe ended up with a chicken Manchurian, a Generals chicken, Chicken chilli dry, chowmein and 4 soups...\n\n\nThe soups were yumm both the chicken corn and hot and sour were yummy..\nThe rice were pretty decent.\nThe serving time was pretty decent.\n\nThe Chicken Manchurian: I'm a freak for CM, but this didn't make my tounge twist at all. The rice were good but the gravy didn't taste good at all.\n\nGenrals Chicken: I personally liked it more then the Manchurian.\n\nChicken Chilli Dry: too spicy for me to taste or review. According to the friend she has tasted better ones.\n\nChowmein : was tasteless. I mean it's noodles how can they go wrong with NOODLES... \n\n\nOverall:\nThe quantity was very poor.\nAnd very average taste.\nBut since I was very hungry and.they have good customer service I'd give them a 6.5.\n\nWill I go again. Yes the soup is a must try so only for that.\nFor the rest of the food.

We had no prior booking and arrived at around 6:50pm. There were just 2 of us and due to some no show(s) we got a table. It was not the best table as it was right above the kitchen and smoke from there making things a little uncomfortable but when we asked the section staff to find another table for us, they were quite keen to find us another table but it was packed to full capacity. We are off to not so good start, as ambiance which is always a crucial part of any Kolachi experience was quite ruined due to that. But hey it was not all over yet.\n\nIftar was served and there was plenty to choose from; pakoras, samosas, chana chaat, dahi phulkis, chicken wings, chicken drumsticks, lahori fish, fruit chaat.. among drinks there was roh-afza, lemonade, mango squash and lassi. I tried chana chaat, chicken wings and drumsticks and lahori fish. everything was quite good, esp chicken wings and drumsticks were both high on taste. I didn't try the rest even though it looked so tempting but I was saving space for dinner. \n\nDinner was followed by iftar and the variety just got wider. There was a salad bar. Prawn tempura, chicken Manchurian, oyster beef(frankly I don't remember the sauce), chicken chowmein, fried rice, thai curry, julienne beef, alfredo pasta, mini burgers were among non desi items. Also hot and sour and corn soup. Those dishes can be avoided in favour of what Kolachi is actually loved for. But still if too tempted go for julienne beef, it was moist and succulent. \n\nAmong desi items there was biryani, nihari, haleem, white karhai, kunna. Again I only tried haleem among it all as there is so much one can stuff oneself with. \n\nKolachi's favourties included hunzai handi, paneer reshmi, peshawari karhai, malai boti, bihari tikka, seekh kebab and 3 types of naan. That's the section one should save most space for. Everything was usual delightful and you get half your money's worth just in that section.(As if rest of the variety was any lesser).\n\nFor rest of the half your money's worth, there is a speciality called oozi. Lamb served with rice, it was love at first bite. I am sure most of you would be going back for a second serve.\n\nThere were plenty to choose from the desserts section. I am sure I have missed out on some items from that extensive menu.\n\nAs far as variety goes, it can't get any better. 10/10\n\nService was usual friendly and attentive. Esp youngsters running the show are very dedicated and you see them passionately working with their staff to make sure everything is going right. Hats off to them.\n\nOverall 8/10, since I couldn't get a better table which was in no way Kolachi's fault but it did make a slight dent in my overall experience and some non desi variety was not Kolachi good. \n\nTo those who are annoyed by the mention of Kolachi, sorry guys but we need to appreciate good things in life and Kolachi has definitely earned it. way to go !!\n\nHighly Recommended any time :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-01T09:23:14+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-02T02:36:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100003553069288","name":"Chanelle Adam Khan"},{"id":"622532960","name":"Ayesha Qureshi"},{"id":"1091359728","name":"Anila Noman"},{"id":"543131941","name":"Morag Khan"},{"id":"1257283317","name":"Aymun Zafar"},{"id":"1368416951","name":"Muhammad Jamal"},{"id":"777939362","name":"Faaiz Deda"},{"id":"1248903988","name":"Amal Faisal Ashoor"},{"id":"672220217","name":"Sukaina Ali"},{"id":"1285044693","name":"Sami Ibrahim Tamimi"},{"id":"592929129","name":"Aqsa Jaliawala"},{"id":"517470504","name":"Nida Ali"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"511130593","name":"Layla Rizvi"},{"id":"100002643873225","name":"Fatima Haider"},{"id":"586930217","name":"Maheen Ahsan"},{"id":"751819688","name":"Erum Hamza"},{"id":"1346742308","name":"Ijlal Malik"},{"id":"520115164","name":"M Usman Khaled"},{"id":"547996286","name":"Shahzaib Javaid"},{"id":"1586595597","name":"Khurram Iqbal"},{"id":"555766150","name":"Faruk Lania"},{"id":"696432032","name":"Samiullah Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk2NDMyMDMy","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_596242730426881/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjk2NDMyMDMy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"596249420426212","from":{"name":"Rizwana Shamim","id":"663526141"},"message":"happy reading :) Go kolachi Go :):)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-01T10:00:11+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"596251557092665","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"Shazeb Siddiki","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-01T10:07:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"745715077","name":"Shazeb Siddiki","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]},{"id":"596253257092495","from":{"name":"Hira Saiyed","id":"867800502"},"message":"Oh thank you.

Except for the Manchurian Of which the chicken was a bit hard all was great. From beef section we took beef chilli which was absolutely delicious and Sichuan fish which I even though not a Sea food lover, loved. Oh and not to forget the hot n sour soup which was also great.

PATHETIC with a capital P. I did tag the damn location but it didn't appear here :( and neither did my cute emoticon :p\n\nKher. Firstly, it was the 10th iftar yesterday so there should not have been the problems that occurred yesterday, The menu was chicken in sticky red sauce, manchurian, fish tamarind, beef chilli gravy and vegetable rice. \n\nWe were the 1st ones to arrive...around 630ish. The place is tiny and cosy in the first look. The wall and ceiling look cool. Every and I mean EVERY single chinese place I have been to has the soya sauce, vinegar with chillies and red chilli sauce but not at Lantern. Anyways. the place was houseful by iftar time and even the tables outside were filled. We thought its a promising sign. \n\nIftar platters were placed with literally miskeen looking drumsticks. They had ZERO salt in them so all went back. The chicken meatball thingys were consumed by 1 of us, the other 4 didnt like the hardness and no-taste fact. The only saving grace were the fried wontons. Missed GD a lot at tht time. \n\nOh there was no TV, no announcement - nothing about the iftar time. AND no arrangement for prayers for ladies. The server had very conveniently informed us that u can go pray with the men in the garden and we were like  ----\u003e :o\n\nOk, then a server comes and takes our order of soup. Options: Hot n Sour Red and white. We ordered both. All I'll say about the soups is that usually the red chilli sauce and vinegar and soya sauce makes the worst of soups consumable. BUT not Lantern. Firstly the sauces came when the soups got cold...and they were the most bland and horrible tasting soups I have tasted. I mean places like Karachi Broast and Chips have served me with better tasting soups.\n\nWe asked the server can we eat coz it was 8 already. (There were 2 tables who were still asking for their soups at 8...poor souls). He said yes and when we reached, all the silver thingys were empty. 2 minutes later, the food (labelled on the silver lids) came but was incorrectly placed and a lot of food was spilled all over the table. I swear I felt like I was in some shadi hall at that time.\n\nNot too much of a fish person, I took the other 3 things. The Beef Chilli Gravy, like the soups were bland and utterly disappointing. The chicken in red sticky sauce had to be cut with steak knives. The sauce was just ok. Not worth the calories. The Manchurian was nice. Thank God, I could at least eat SOMETHING from the table. When I went for the second round, none of the dishes had meat in them and no one had bothered to check.\n\nThe operations manager had apologized for the mishaps saying today everything was going wrong. Well, after paying 970 per head, not even 1 of us wanted to give them any benefit of doubt. The comment card was photocopied with stuff doodled behind it. Gave them a very honest review and wished them the best of luck in the future as the 5 of us wont be going back at least. \n\nWORST IFTAR EXPERIENCE. \n\nOne day before iftar at Nandos was SUPERB. Pics and review following.

I expressed what I felt like, upon which the head waiters manager (a lady) and their another head waiter or someone came to me, asking about the comments.

After our complimentary crackers and green tea, we were served our appetizers Prawn Toasts (10/10, delectable!), next up we ordered Crispy beef, Lemon Prawn, Chicken Manchurian, Vegetable fried rice and American Chopsuey for our main course, and everything was divine. I've sampled Chinese from numerous restaurants around the city but I have to say the Crispy Beef and Lemon Prawn here was impeccably done!

Golden Dragon - My new love for Thai and Chinese food. Hot favourites: American Chopsuey, Crispy Beef, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Hot and Sour Soup, Thai Soup, Thai Green Curry, Wontons, Zingers and Chicken Karhai (the last two from their Lunch Xpress section)\n\n2. Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb's warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I'm not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away. Will go soon to be blown away by other things too.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-25T18:59:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-27T14:47:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"505164013","name":"Yasmeen Agad-Kothawala"},{"id":"515396294","name":"Danish Ali Dahraj"},{"id":"100003249618202","name":"Heer Ahmed"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"500907007","name":"Murtaza Moiz"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNjUxNzIy","before":"NjU3MDMxNzQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"404073356310487","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"i see myself featured here too, obliged and humbled Hajra Amir","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T19:33:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir","type":"user","offset":52,"length":10}]},{"id":"404123489638807","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Thank you Hajra :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T21:13:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra","type":"user","offset":10,"length":5}]},{"id":"404386042945885","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"These places are on my fingertips 24/7!!!

The crispy beef and chicken Manchurian were not bad, not great or out of this world or anything but decent enough to order again when you have a craving for Chinese.

We ordered the Mezzah Platter, and as usual 5 star to the platter which was awesome, feta and  olives along with humous my favourite on it! As it was just two of us, by the time we were done with bread and platter, we felt stuffed! because both were soo good! Anyhow, i had already ordered Chicken Roulade. and despite being full, i still managed to eat 70% of it because it was veryyyyyy good! and the frnd ordered Braised Lamb--again a large serving however she thought the taste was slightly bland. But i would also discount that we had quite heavily satiated our taste buds with the starters!\n\nAnd well, this did not leave any place for desserts! But overall as usual after 18months, the Okra experience ws still the same! so three cheers for them!\n\nNight time shift was my initiation to Port Gran with 14 other odd frnds and family frm abroad. and what a place it is!!! amazing! makes me feel even more proud of karachi..:):) And i am already eagerly looking forward to the expansion and addition to the place. There was a live Sindhi Musical cultural performance while we were there, which i thought was a great idea, kept the public very entertained, depicted the culture of Sindh and should be continued as well. For dinner, we landed at Chairman Mao, (being their regular customer in my karachi-days for delivery). Ordred Pizza, and well how much i am a fan of Mao, the pizza tasted very mediocre. We ordered Chicken Tikka pizza, and the pizza had too much of chaat masala! whch kind of lowered the taste! so ws slightly disappointed. Then went for Chickn Manchurian and Chicken in Oyester Sauce, both were fine too, but lacked the 'kick' that i used to get after having a Mao-meal! they tasted like a very ordinary meal from a desi-chinese place. Either Mao's port grand branch hs different recipe, or the quality has just deteriorated slightly.\n\nBut the port Grand experience was marvellous! cant wait to be back next year with even better PG!\n\nTommorow's lunch-- Olivetto!!
