Never has this been the case with food at Fuji.

Second visit today. Again, didn't comment earlier as it could've been beginner's luck but today...WOW. I can easily name it my new favourite sushi place but we can always do with more than one.

Situated up above Pearl Continental Hotel, the place was no less than magnificent when we walked in. The subtle ambiance, the pre-50's music playing, the extra-courteous waiters, I had a feeling it was going to be one amazing dinner. I had ordered the Chicken Dijon Steak and my friend ordered the Lobster Tail. After approximately twenty minutes of waiting, we had our food served to us. I can describe the food in one work, HORRIBLE! When a place is charging more than RS. 1000 per steak, one would obviously expect it to be amazing, but it was the worst steak I've had in the city. And don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind paying extra money if the food is worth it, sadly this wasn't even close. I would go as far as saying Arizona Grill serves better steaks than this place. It's terribly overpriced for the horrible food they serve. The portions were extra-small, and the steak tasted like something that would be made at home. I rank this high-class restaurant, not classy enough to go to.

It was a group of 14 and were there by 930p.  Appetizers were ordered, were served in time, and tasted good.  After that it was all downhill.\nNothing out of the ordinary was ordered for main course, most ppl ordered the usual teppanyaki/teriyaki etc.  Four major issues that we had after that:\n1)  Dinner was served quite late.  I guess preparing for 14 people takes time but it was being served piecemeal.\n2)  I ordered tuna avocado roll.  When it was served, it looked good.  Took the first bite and guess what, I tasted apple.  Why in the world would u use an apple in tuna avocado roles.  They have never done that before and I'm quite frequent at Kamamishi.  If they didn't have avocado, say so and I'll order something else.\n3)  Drinks were ordered with dinner.  People were finishing their meal and drinks would just not show up.  Kept on asking, but they just won't serve it.\n4)  And the worst of all:  One guest ordered beef teppanyaki and it was brought out when everyone else was done with their dinner.  I'm not talking a little late.  I'm talking good 30mins after when everyone else was served.  Twice the waiter was asked about it and even once the manager was notified.  They kept saying, \"sir, abhi aa raha hai.\"  Ofcourse it was sent back because he was put off by the miserable service by then and was no longer hungry.\nOver all the staff was inefficient, clueless and didn't know their own menu.\nI forced everyone to go there last nite as majority favored Sakura.  I didnt hear the end of it and was quite embarrassed.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-16T08:57:53+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-17T17:02:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"686445178","name":"Fahim Bilwani"},{"id":"580750864","name":"Murtaza Salim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTgwNzUwODY0","before":"Njg2NDQ1MTc4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"398764280174728","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Please complain to the concerned party.

The other option would be for us to reduce the prices by not using the best ingredients available in the market, something which we are not prepared to do. As an example, the beef burger or the roast beef sandwich is the same cut and quality used for our steaks at Cafe Flo. We hope that you visit us and judge for yourself and of course any comments that you may post after would be given attention. Sabah Rahman glad that you like the crab ravioli. The reason the crab ravioli is not as much as you expect is because crabs are one of the most difficult ingredients to clean, prepare and we have someone dedicated just for that. We can increase it but the price would have to as well, which would make us a full fledged restaurant instead of a trendy, gourmet cafe that we hope and wish to be. Nevertheless  all comments are appreciated and connstrucive criticism is the only thing that can help us improve at our weak points.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-11-30T16:51:20+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi","type":"user","offset":3,"length":10},{"id":"530610724","name":"Sabah Rahman","type":"user","offset":704,"length":12}]},{"id":"269265146457976","from":{"name":"Bilal Alvi","id":"641495625"},"message":"Alexandre Rizvi, i love your approach, and now, solely due to this very courteous post, I shall visit your caf? very soon and try out the food that I have heard so much about.
