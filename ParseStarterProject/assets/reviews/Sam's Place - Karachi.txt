It is located right above Butler?s Chocolate Caf? on main Zamzama (where New York Caf? once was).\nRight from the entrance in the side lane to the restaurant itself, the management seems to have paid a good deal of attention to detail in the d?cor and have kept the place spotless (so far).\nWe ordered a bunch of things, but what really stood out were the ?Parmesan Crusted Chicken in Orange Sauce?, and their ?Seafood Salad?.\nWe were served complementary bite-sized appetizers, and an assortment of bread with sundried-tomato butter and garlic butter.  Although these were pretty good, but I?m still a fan of the bread they serve at Pompei Restaurant.\nThe chicken had 2 generously-sized juicy fillets that had been batter fried and topped with orange sauce. This combination of flavors made a perfect blend (unlike most people have been able to do with pretty much any dish that has an orange sauce). The dish is served with side of vegetables and gratin potatoes.\nThe Salad was extremely impressive on its own and is a great meal for any seafood lover who?s looking to eat something refreshing! It had an assortment of shrimps, calamari, lobster and scallops served with iceberg lettuce. This was a very substantially sized serving that seemed perfect for a healthy lunch, or a filling dinner if accompanied with a starter or desert.\nUnfortunately we were so full after this meal that there was no room to even think of ordering anything for desert (note for my next visit: order less in the appetizers and save space for desert) \nIt was disappointing to see the low turnout at this restaurant ?unlike most Zamzama eateries (even on weekdays). However I?m assuming one should make reservations if you plan on going on a weekend.\nWould highly recommend Sam?s Place for a quiet dinner (ironically right in the middle of Zamzama), or a bright and sunny lunch (the space has great big windows to let in loads of natural light in the day).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-20T07:05:35+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-20T13:28:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"882650316","name":"Sabah Shaikh"},{"id":"646760193","name":"Rehma Tirmizey"},{"id":"814525594","name":"Sohaib A Junaidi"},{"id":"505596876","name":"Samia Salman"},{"id":"591827743","name":"Tuba Arshad"},{"id":"515754753","name":"Hala Anjum Syed"},{"id":"505430448","name":"Nabeel Da"},{"id":"665006600","name":"Cyma Almakky"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY1MDA2NjAw","before":"ODgyNjUwMzE2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"621729241211563","from":{"name":"Zainab Abidi","id":"502297291"},"message":"Dude we wnet there and their service was painfully slow which ticked me off","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-20T07:08:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"621753764542444","from":{"name":"Amal Anis Makda","id":"542900496"},"message":"same here went there... ordered one of their mushroom steak... dont exactly remember the name of the entree'..Despite, being a  beef steak  it wasnt juicy as expected.There was a weird stinking smell in the beef like something had happened to their meat in the fridge.The flavor was bland and tasteless to the extent that i had pack the whole thing and give it to the beggar on way.All they had served was a huge chunk of beef in the plate with the same bizzare creame mushroom sauce on top of it..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-20T09:29:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"621828617868292","from":{"name":"Maryam Maqbool","id":"652495530"},"message":"Agreed Mikail.
