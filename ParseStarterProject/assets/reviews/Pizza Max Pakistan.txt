But now, I regret that I did that. And this is the reason why.\n\nMe and my friends went for Iftar at Pizza Max on Wednesday. To start off with, the iftar timing on the said day was around 7:15 or 7:16. We were served Pizza at exactly 7:59pm. It is understandable that it takes time but THIS MUCH TIME IS PREPOSTEROUS.\n\nSecondly, when we protested with a waiter to serve us, he came back with a pizza and literally \"shoved\" 3 pieces of pizza slices on our platter like he is feeding a dog and started mumbling something as if \"HUM MUFT PIZZA KHANAY AYEN HAIN\".\n\nWe went to the manager to register our protest who in turn apologized and told us to return to our seats. But our self-esteem did not allow us to return. We did not take a single bite of the pizza, we just had 2 drinks, a date and a meager amount of salad as we were waiting for the pizza. And the height of disrespect was when they charged us PKR.600 for 2 drinks and some pineapples that we had.\n\nMe and my friends are never coming to Pizza Max again and we would certainly advise others to follow suit.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-09T07:24:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-09T07:24:41+0000","restaurantName":"Pizza Max Pakistan"},{"id":"165861103465048_591503710900783","from":{"name":"Syed Wajahat Ali","id":"537307784"},"message":"Went to Pizza Max Pakistan (Near 5 star) yesterday and I must say, for Rs. 600, the food was zabardast. It was an all you can eat deal with fresh salad, drinks and of course pizza. The service was impeccable, the place clean and hygienic, and the seating comfortable. \n\nWhat else do you need I must ask? I give it a 8/10 ( -2 because it had Amir Liaquat show turned on on high volume -_-)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-24T06:19:55+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-25T02:14:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"1316130943","name":"Madiha Gillani"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000961720252","name":"Nouman Soorty"},{"id":"1149289051","name":"Syed Adeel Ahmed"},{"id":"100001259041364","name":"Foziya Mobeen"},{"id":"1285044693","name":"Sami Ibrahim Tamimi"},{"id":"716506757","name":"Amaan Aziz Zuberi"},{"id":"530061740","name":"Annum Qadri"},{"id":"100000385922820","name":"Alina Maniar"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"567065615","name":"Ruba Mehreen"},{"id":"100006355740453","name":"Fatima Zehra"},{"id":"789059761","name":"Asim Mashkoor"},{"id":"505055634","name":"Umme Ifrah Arif"},{"id":"549415486","name":"Yasir Ahmad"},{"id":"567195014","name":"Asfandiyar Dayan Khan"},{"id":"592375298","name":"Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah"},{"id":"100001523526000","name":"Anas Khan"},{"id":"543845188","name":"Hafsa Azhar"},{"id":"693890937","name":"Hafsa Akhtar"},{"id":"100002850760185","name":"Nayab Ali"},{"id":"100000312804506","name":"Huzaifa Kardame"},{"id":"866095436","name":"Eesha Nasir"},{"id":"649237316","name":"Farhan Siddiqui"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ5MjM3MzE2","before":"MTAwMDAwOTIwMTAyMjgx"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_591503710900783/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjQ5MjM3MzE2"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"591512930899861","from":{"name":"Farhan Siddiqui","id":"649237316"},"message":"LOLz @ -2 explanation.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-24T06:58:23+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591516657566155","from":{"name":"Wishal Pirzada","id":"100001627460337"},"message":"I would give +5 for that .. lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-24T07:16:40+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591516670899487","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"Its a nice place, copied everything from pizza hut................... ambience, seating arrangements etc, just the taste of pizza is way better then pizza hut :))","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-24T07:16:44+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591517654232722","from":{"name":"Rehan Baig","id":"100001740461590"},"message":"I would have given -5 for that","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-24T07:21:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591519480899206","from":{"name":"Sheharyar Mujahid","id":"500846017"},"message":"You actually had food while watching Amir Liaquat show?
