We settled on Xander's since a couple of people have recommended it and it has a courtyard where we could sit outside and the little one could putter around. As it turns out the courtyard was swarming with flies so that was a non-starter and we moved indoors. The decor was nice and the staff courteous and friendly. My daughter loved the Christmas Tree and got a complimentary chocolate which she scarfed down in no time. I was a little disappointed with the menu selection which seemed limited and at first I couldn't really find anything that took my fancy, however when a couple of plates of fish and chips wafted by for the neighbouring table, both my wife and I were tempted since it looked like genuine battered english-style fish and chips.\n\nThe service was swift, but as it turns out the fish was very poor. It just tasted off somehow (my wife claimed one of the pieces she got tasted fine so it may have been the fish was a bit old - I'm not sure) and the tartar sauce was also strangely sour - I'm not sure if that was because of something in it or it was also getting on in age. The quantity of the fish was nothing to write home about but since neither of us liked it that wasn't an issue. The fries were standard mon salwa type stuff and in good quantities. We regretted not getting different dishes, though as I said earlier I wasn't too impressed by the diversity of the selection. We unanimously decided to forgo desert at Xander's and go elsewhere instead (ended up going to Hotspot where the desert was great as usual but the experience slightly spoilt by a table-full of 14 year-old girls smoking like chimneys).\n\nBut as it turns out our troubles at Xander's weren't over. I paid by credit card but was told by the cashier that they were getting an error and it wasn't charged. So I paid in cash but then checked my phone to see I had received an sms from the credit card company saying it had been charged. I showed the msg to the staff who said I should ignore it since it hadnt been charged. I called the card people who confirmed it had been and informed the staff. To cut a long story short it took over 20 minutes to sort the matter out by which time the kids were going stir-crazy and I had a splitting headache. The problem probably wasn't the staff's fault and they were courteous throughout but it made the whole experience all the more disappointing. When my wife asked me later if I'd ever want to go again I thought I wouldn't completely rule out the idea but probably not for a full meal.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-25T11:26:15+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-26T06:46:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1359810443","name":"Nuria Munir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM1OTgxMDQ0Mw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTM1OTgxMDQ0Mw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"283942944990196","from":{"name":"Nida Huq","id":"850419690"},"message":"I agreed with you.

Being a regular steak eater and NOT into bunches of non-carnivore dishes, imagine the horror of me planning a visit to Raj Rasoi! But my beloved wife, Mariyam Masood wanted to go; so today we went for lunch with a couple of friends! Happy to report that it was a great experience. Nice little touches like the hand washing before and after the meal. Enjoyed many of the options available ... not a big bhindi or baingan person so I passed on those but was very pleasantly surprised at everything else. The daal was great, the chicken was surprisingly good as was the mutter paneer. Combine this with great puris and attentive yet non-intrusive service, it was a really enjoyable meal in a nice setting. The dessert was channay ka halwa, not one of my staple favourites but still enjoyed it. Mariyam will post her own comments but both our friends also had nothing but praise for the Raj Rasoi experience. The final icing on the cake was the surprise of buy one, get 50% off the second lunch special that I had no idea about but was grateful for!! With tip, the total was about 700 per head which is infinitely reasonable for a good meal, great service and ambiance. I would say that even if its not a place you might frequent, it is well worth a visit!!","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-13T15:53:41+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-14T06:20:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"100000578236531","name":"Naheed Asim"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nzc3NjQ3ODAy","before":"MTAwMDAyMzc0OTE3MDM5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"277240342327123","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"As with any food place, one must keep an open mind and be flexible.
