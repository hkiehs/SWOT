So it was my best friend Bisma's birthday celebration today so my friends and I went on a 'eating spree' you could say today and thus, I will write the reviews for all the places we went to and the things we ate.\nThe first place was McDonald's :p amazing caramel shake! One large shake between 4 girls. Hehe. And fries are always good. Then we went to Dolmen ka Gloria Jeans. We ordered the Aussie cheese fries and a mixed berry chiller. Both were, in my friend's words, outstanding. The cheese fries at Gloria's are the best! \nNext, Golden Dragon. We ordered the lunch box deal for one with egg fried rice and Szechuan chicken, though I personally insisted on the dinner deal which has 2 drumsticks as well (for lunch, I might add) and even though they said it was not possible, Qamarunisa is such a sweetheart that we spoke to her and she made it happen. Love her for that because we got drumsticks (that i was desperate for cuz they are so yummy). So overall drumsticks, Szechuan, rice, everything was divine as usual. Lastly, Grub. From what I can tell, this place is highly underrated and has amazing food so I think it deserves a good review. We ordered Grub Mush burgers, one pepperoni pizza, and their chocolate cake. The burger was huge and yummy as usual. It was the first time for all of us in ordering the pizza. It was quite yummy, cheesy and filling. The cake was soft, moist and just the right amount of chocolately goodness. Overall, an excellent day :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-10T16:05:16+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-10T18:41:00+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002403038747","name":"Noor Jamil"},{"id":"100004798268639","name":"Suha Qasim Memon"},{"id":"100000046931487","name":"Rida Ahmed"},{"id":"100000030480095","name":"Mehak Fatima"},{"id":"1406568558","name":"Ayesha Rehman"},{"id":"100002532210597","name":"Sana Ahmed"},{"id":"1000064178","name":"Kifah Memon"},{"id":"1371113498","name":"Danyal Sopariwala"},{"id":"851800404","name":"Aamna Mansoor Badshah"},{"id":"540790569","name":"Safa Cochinwala"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"759420423","name":"Huzefa Marvi"},{"id":"512864890","name":"Scidra Usman"},{"id":"532368457","name":"Areesha Junejo"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"598492138","name":"Hamza Shaikh"},{"id":"523035550","name":"Afifa Ali"},{"id":"100001246692407","name":"Bakir Hussain"},{"id":"100002046384968","name":"Usman Daudpota"},{"id":"547960510","name":"Husnain Minawala"},{"id":"574808344","name":"Kiran Dada"},{"id":"100001791165202","name":"Asjad Nadeem"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"509315108","name":"Daniyal Qazi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5MzE1MTA4","before":"MTAwMDAyNDAzMDM4NzQ3"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_664653446919142/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTA5MzE1MTA4"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"664656560252164","from":{"name":"Afnan Iftikhar","id":"604430259"},"message":"\"dear diary ...\"","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-10T16:13:24+0000","like_count":23,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664657286918758","from":{"name":"Akbar Chaudry","id":"549896211"},"message":"that is an exceptional escapade. do all of your best friends receive such treatment? if so, i would like to throw my hat into the ring","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-10T16:15:07+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664657350252085","from":{"name":"Talha Habib","id":"100001830205217"},"message":"Marvi Shah How in the world u manage to gulp down all this much  food in one day","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-10T16:15:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664657710252049","from":{"name":"Marvi Shah","id":"522705412"},"message":"Lol all shared everything and ate everything with time intervals beech beech main","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-10T16:16:17+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664657740252046","from":{"name":"Khurram A Khan","id":"566660881"},"message":"Happy b'day Bisma \ncheerzz","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-10T16:16:21+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664658536918633","from":{"name":"Sundus Qasim","id":"1213637082"},"message":"What a cute review ^_^","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-10T16:19:01+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"664658626918624","from":{"name":"Marvi Shah","id":"522705412"},"message":"Sundus Qasim Bisma Patel Sakina Qutub\nQamarunnisa Asim","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-10T16:19:28+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim","type":"user","offset":0,"length":12},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel","type":"user","offset":13,"length":11},{"id":"548242045","name":"Sakina Qutub","type":"user","offset":25,"length":12},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","type":"user","offset":38,"length":16}]},{"id":"664658996918587","from":{"name":"Kiran Dada","id":"574808344"},"message":"So does it mean u started off with lunch and finished with a perfect dinner :);)\nKidding!

I was still reeling from that traumatic experience when I read 2 weeks later that the Al-Baik outlet was NOT affiliated with the actual Al-Baik in Saudi .. I have a feeling I might be reading something similar about BK in the local Dawn a coupla weeks later .. \n\nTo elaborate the BK outlet was at seaview .. was on a high after watching Gravity in 3D and appreciating our world and everything in it .. walked in to find very few people which was heartening .. finally I'd get my favorite BK mushroom n swiss without having to wait 2 hrs in line & without having to drive 2 hrs to Hardees .. Whopper is not my favorite due to both the presence of ketchup & the similarity to Mcdees quarter pounder .. Juggled between shroom n swiss & the BK fish burger before deciding on the double mushroom n swiss (Rs. 560). Then the series of Debacles:\n\n1. Waiting time after order placement - Instead of the standard 5-6 min, waited for 15 min before requesting for delivery at the table.\n\n2. While waiting for the order saw the floor manager take a cup meant for customers, pour out some soda, drink it and put it back in the cup holder .. he left .. I rubbed my eyes; maybe the space movie from earlier had messed with my senses .. realized he really had done the unthinkable .. called him, confronted him about it, he denied initially then admitted his mistake, took the cup out of the holder and discarded it and went about his business without a 2nd thought.\n\n3. Ok maybe they're learning, lets cut them some slack, the double shroom'll put everything right, I thought ... till the burger actually came at my table .. folded in a whopper jr wrapper .. a tiny kid's burger .. Aah it's ok they messed up my order, gave me the whopper jr meant for the 6 yr old cutie at my adjacent table .. I told the server \"Ye barabar walon ka order hai, mera nahi\" .. \"Nahi sir ye apka order hai, double mushroom n swiss!\" .. \"Aik min, yaheen kharre rahe raho\" .. opened the wrapper to find a tiny sandwich that begged to be forgotten .. postmartemed it to find a slice of local cheese over a single slice of 'pasanda' with 5 tiny shrooms on top .. i say pasanda because this pattie was half as thin as Mcdees cheeseburger .. and that's pretty damn thin .. I asked for the restaurant manager; he came all serious-faced asking what's wrong .. I asked him if this was a double mushroom n swiss? He said \"Sorry sir, single mushroom n swiss hai yeh, mai abhi double karwata hoon issko\" ... I questioned the size of the burger, the thickness of the pattie, the presence of the local cheese instead of swiss cheese and 5 tiny mushrooms & he confirmed me that the double version had an extra pattie, that being the only difference .. I asked him how he could justify selling this local pasanda burger, that wouldn't fill up my toddler's tummy, for Rs. 560 and how he could live with himself trying to sell this off as a Burger King burger? From serious-faced to Ashen-faced. He mumbled something inaudible. I decided the mushroom n swiss was off the cards and I best change my order. \"Please get me 2 Fish Burgers & chicken nuggets instead. Maybe you'll redeem yourself then\". I rued not having taking a snap of the burger to dissuade all you good people thinking of visiting.\n\n4. Asked for 2 fish burgers because the price (Rs. 290) made me realize that would be tiny too. But little did I know that I'd get a microwaved burger containing a fried then 'poached' fish pattie .. yes poached! .. the photo attached will show you moist bubbles in the center of the fish with 2 wrinkly soft burnt bun halves! ... Horrible!!\n\n5. The nuggets, their last chance at redemption were drier than an arab's sandal! .. fried to the extent that all the goodness, all the juice had been squeezed out of the chicken.\n\nI walked out in disgust, without paying the extra charge for the nuggets or the burger difference. I exercised exceptional self-control not further berating Mr. Ashen-face like he deserved. Gordon Ramsay'd probably burnt the place down if he'd visited instead of me. \nI expect to visit the wikileaks page in a coupla weeks time to read that the Burger King outlets in Karachi are knock-offs of the real thing .. low quality imitations (not even!) of the real product.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-11-02T22:51:10+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-09T04:40:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1620471256","name":"Shahbaz Javed Khan"},{"id":"587291629","name":"Saad Muhammed Sheikh"},{"id":"514440277","name":"M?ri?

Dinner at Olivetto after a long hiatus, and I doubt I'll be going back again.  The place has a formal ambiance, with Eminem talking about someone's mother, and some guys rapping about flying high like a Gulfstream.  The music being played was a disaster, and the place rivaled McDonalds and Burger King in playing the most retarded music.  \n\nThe bread served with Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar was fresh, and reminded me of the standard starters served on the Mediterranean coast.  Wouldn't mind having a more generous serving of Olive Oil, as what was served was barely sufficient for one person.\n\nOrdered the Arabic Platter, Meaty Lasagne, and Chicken Florentine for main course.  The Arabic Platter was brilliant, the lamb was moist, succulent, and juicy -- while the beef was cooked to perfection.  The pita was fresh, and the serving of Hummus was generous.  \n\nThe lasagne was a disaster -- it lacked texture, and the taste was just off.  Pizza Hut served a better lasagne once upon a time.  The Chicken Florentine was decent, but can't figure the nomenclature when it lacked the primary ingredient, i.e. spinach.   Also ordered Chocolate Molten Lava - it was grainy, and better offerings are served by other eateries.\n\nThe place levies a service charge, which basically means the patron pays a component of staff salaries, which is supposed to be built in the prices on the menu.  Soon enough, they may also start charging Generator Charges, Gas Charges, etc.  \n\nAs a policy, I don't like to go to places which have 'service charges' in place -- so I guess, I will be avoiding Olivetto for good.  If (almost) European prices are being paid in Karachi, and there is nothing special about the food -- a place is better off being avoided.\n\nOverall Rating -- 6/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-02T21:07:14+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-03T15:14:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1360134242","name":"Fahima Mubashir"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"},{"id":"1031220895","name":"M Saquib Khwaja"},{"id":"1086930427","name":"Ali Saif Memon"},{"id":"776525430","name":"Khadija Tahir"},{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"1198610816","name":"Maheen Siddiqui"},{"id":"746376004","name":"Sameen Shahid"},{"id":"851275369","name":"Belinda Fonseca"},{"id":"100001185864732","name":"Faryal Noman"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1247552277","name":"Abdullah Farooq"},{"id":"844625322","name":"Goher Zaman"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

I would venture to say that McDonald's is wildly successful both in sales and brand loyalty. As far as quality and pricing go, I would say that statement is inaccurate too. Other than Johnny Rockets which is yet to open, based on my personal experience as well as the comments of others, the rest are very comparable to other countries in both food quality and prices. Remember, these are Pakistani businesses even though they carry an international logo and we should stop bashing them without any factual basis.

Tried this a few days ago, finally getting the time to write this now.\nDomino?s used to be a regular at our home, but had stopped ordering due to lapses in quality. Decided to order again after reading good reviews on food forums combined with prompting by the parents (who have always loved Dominos)and I am happy to say that the old Domino?s taste is back notable improvements. \nOrdered the Tandoori Feast (Chicken), Italiano Feast (Beef) & the Stuffed Tex-Mex Cheesy Bread  and the food came in 30 minutes on the dot. The best part about the Pizza ? the beautiful crust, crisp yet soft & chewy, with a dusting of cornmeal at the edges! I became a fan of McD?s when they launched their cornmeal burger buns and exact same experience with Dominos! Toppings wise, there could have been more chicken and a little bit more consistency across slices might have prevented fights over the best pieces. However, both flavors were loved by the family. \nThen the Cheesy Bread ? Domino?s is known for its Pizza, but the bread could easily have been the star of the evening! Breadsticks stuffed with cheese & tex-mex chicken topped with cheese made for 8 pieces of delicious cheesy indulgence!\nMy only complaints: the lack of condiments ?there was no garlic & red chili flakes. Secondly, one small container of marinara sauce is not enough for the breadsticks, so more would be preferred. \nLastly, they need to update their menu on their website! The current deals link does not work, and they don?t have any delivery deals for ?x? number of people mentioned. Since the order taker told me about a deal for 4 people, I am sure there are some and updating them would save time in order placement. \nP.s. deleting & posting again because had mistakenly posted a really small picture earlier!","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-10-19T21:31:03+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-20T12:16:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"512777667","name":"AMmar Mursalin"},{"id":"100002971695699","name":"Syeda Tehseen Zehra Naqvi"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"579933313","name":"Ali Daudpota"},{"id":"675647072","name":"Ambreen Ashraf"},{"id":"1035196445","name":"Anusha Ahmed"},{"id":"521905536","name":"Umair Durrani"},{"id":"100003698171140","name":"Asra Mushtaq"},{"id":"500846017","name":"Sheharyar Mujahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAwODQ2MDE3","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc0MDgxMjMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"636902953027525","from":{"name":"Shahroz McRashid","id":"100003629416976"},"message":"where are the all the (Y) s?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-19T22:21:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"636945583023262","from":{"name":"Hasnain Hanif","id":"770944605"},"message":"this made me emotional :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T01:12:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637048449679642","from":{"name":"Khalid Saleem","id":"657031744"},"message":"your review is quite appealing and would definitely give it a try soon but i wonder why the pictures are so bland saying more of otherwise what you expressed","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T07:05:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637058733011947","from":{"name":"Kiran Afzal","id":"635810442"},"message":"Could be either of two issues: not great photography and pizza doesn't always photograph well, especially when its beef! ..better pictures next time, hopefully!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T07:40:10+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637089983008822","from":{"name":"Nasim Ahmad","id":"1343979604"},"message":"Very nice.

In such chaotic and troubled times if someone has taken an initiative and managed to open up 3 of the outlets of a brand which is famous worldwide, then it is indeed very daring of him and definitely requires a lot of support from the citizens. Secondly stop comparing BK with burger shack. BK is a little bit on the dryer side worldwide and its fan following is accordingly. Hardees and burger shack are in a different league of greasy burgers so comparing BS with Hardees seems more appropriate. Thirdly get your arrogance and pessimism off your heads. BK is serving pretty decent burgers and fries.

For sure, teething problems on the operations side and a limited menu. However, the Whopper with Cheese was 80% like the burgers that I have eaten at BK in other countries. The main difference being that this was more well done and a touch drier than the prior experiences. That may be a personal thing since I also eat my steak medium rare! The basic taste of the burger was the flame grilled rather than fried that I prefer but it did seem a tad hastily prepared. My sense is that within a short period of time, the minor issues that exist will be ironed out and BK will be the same in Karachi as it is for an occasional fast food indulgence abroad.\n\nPreviously, my biggest complaint, and main reason why BK was not usually in my fast food options, were the fries. The new BK fries are 300% better than before and were a pleasant surprise! No, not quite as good as McDonalds or OPTP but pretty darned good ... and I even think they will be better in a few days!! I didn't try the Pepsi but was told by a member of my dining group that it was quite good.\n\nAgain, please keep in mind that my positive comments do not seek to compare a fast food burger to the exceptional offerings that can be had at restaurants such as Forty4. For a fast food burger, I personally prefer the Whopper to the Big Mac... and might think about trying the Angus version too. So, all in all, happy to have BK here in Karachi as another dining option.\n\nFinally, the Dolmen Mall food scene has truly become something special with tons and tons of reputable options for quick food as well as restaurants.

It was home to a culinary delight of mythical proportions, called The Whopper. As time passed and consumerism ruled, places similar to Burger King started their slow but deliberate invasion of our fine country. However, as they came one after another, Burger King remained elusive. And as with all things elusive, they more it played hard to get, the more we craved it. When we travelled abroad, we would have BK at every available opportunity - in some cases, people even went to extreme lengths like buying it from the DXB airport (where it was conveniently located near gate 210, where the morning Karachi flight invariably was) so that it could be brought back and enjoyed with the family. \n\nAnd then one day, there was an ad in a newspaper, advertising jobs at? gasp? Burger King Pakistan! It has been a journey of epic anticipation, waiting (thankfully not with baited breath) until today, when I lined up with many others in the glaring sun outside BK Nishat to have my ever favourite - the Double Whopper. The queue moved relatively fast and in about 30 minutes, I was in. Another 20 minutes and I was at the counter, where I found out, to my utter dismay, that there is no Double Whopper. A minor misstep, I thought, and promptly ordered three Whopper meals and two Chicken Royale meals. There was some confusion about whether fries are being served to customers or not, as there was a shortage and perhaps fries were only being provided to customers who had placed their orders well before mine. But that was quickly sorted and I was assured that five lovely packets of fries would accompany the burgers. There was a wait of 15-20 minutes for the food to be served, although it felt like eternity. And then, suddenly, there it was: a Whopper, in front of me, in Pakistan. Fast forward twenty minutes and there you have wrappers on the trays, empty Pepsi glasses and fry packets. The fries, by the way, are absolutely mind-glowingly good. Its hard to believe they're from a fast food outlet. The burgers? are a slightly different, more complicated story. They were good, but as we left, I couldn't help but think that the whole experience was somewhat underwhelming. So I really thought about it - yes, it wasn't a Double Whopper which is what I always have, but that wasn't it. And its not as though the burgers were bad: they're just like BK everywhere else. The size is good, its a nice filling meal without making you feel stuffed. Even the Pepsi was really good :) But the problem is this: when I first visited Burger Shack, I couldn't wait to go back. And sadly, I don't feel the same way about BK. In fact, I'm not really feeling the need to go back. And I think the reason is this: we've been spoiled by offerings like Burger Shack. The advent of the gourmet burger into our lives means that as good as the Whopper is, its just not good enough. I know I'm not alone in comparing Burger King to Burger Shack - at least four people in BK were doing the same thing. \n\nIn conclusion: Burger King is, or rather, the Whopper, Angus and Chicken Royale are just like their foreign counterparts. I'm sure that the others, including the Swiss and Mushroom will be just as good, whenever they are launched. The onion rings too, when they become available, should be good. They're having a lot of management related issues right now and the staff is clearly under-trained, but that will be fixed over time. You can go to BK and know that you'll get the same taste you get everywhere else - just don't go expecting BK to blow the local offerings out of the water. Because, as I'm unbelievably proud to say, the local offerings are better. Which reminds me, I haven't had Burger Shack in a while...","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-06T12:20:33+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-07T12:06:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"569196654","name":"Maria Sultan"},{"id":"786471893","name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed"},{"id":"648091964","name":"Saba Sadia"},{"id":"732705760","name":"Nishat Aleem Khan"},{"id":"752174107","name":"Urooj Imran"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1371113498","name":"Danyal Sopariwala"},{"id":"571881277","name":"Sna Nm"},{"id":"565157664","name":"Sarah Farooq"},{"id":"100000223684855","name":"Sana A.

It was home to a culinary delight of mythical proportions, called The Whopper. As time passed and consumerism ruled, places similar to Burger King started their slow but deliberate invasion of our fine country. However, as they came one after another, Burger King remained elusive. And as with all things elusive, they more it played hard to get, the more we craved it. When we travelled abroad, we would have BK at every available opportunity - in some cases, people even went to extreme lengths like buying it from the DXB airport (where it was conveniently located near gate 210, where the morning Karachi flight invariably was) so that it could be brought back and enjoyed with the family. \n\nAnd then one day, there was an ad in a newspaper, advertising jobs at? gasp? Burger King Pakistan! It has been a journey of epic anticipation, waiting (thankfully not with baited breath) until today, when I lined up with many others in the glaring sun outside BK Nishat to have my ever favourite - the Double Whopper. The queue moved relatively fast and in about 30 minutes, I was in. Another 20 minutes and I was at the counter, where I found out, to my utter dismay, that there is no Double Whopper. A minor misstep, I thought, and promptly ordered three Whopper meals and two Chicken Royale meals. There was some confusion about whether fries are being served to customers or not, as there was a shortage and perhaps fries were only being provided to customers who had placed their orders well before mine. But that was quickly sorted and I was assured that five lovely packets of fries would accompany the burgers. There was a wait of 15-20 minutes for the food to be served, although it felt like eternity. And then, suddenly, there it was: a Whopper, in front of me, in Pakistan. Fast forward twenty minutes and there you have wrappers on the trays, empty Pepsi glasses and fry packets. The fries, by the way, are absolutely mind-glowingly good. Its hard to believe they're from a fast food outlet. The burgers? are a slightly different, more complicated story. They were good, but as we left, I couldn't help but think that the whole experience was somewhat underwhelming. So I really thought about it - yes, it wasn't a Double Whopper which is what I always have, but that wasn't it. And its not as though the burgers were bad: they're just like BK everywhere else. The size is good, its a nice filling meal without making you feel stuffed. Even the Pepsi was really good :) But the problem is this: when I first visited Burger Shack, I couldn't wait to go back.

The advent of the gourmet burger into our lives means that as good as the Whopper is, its just not good enough. I know I'm not alone in comparing Burger King to Burger Shack - at least four people in BK were doing the same thing. \n\nIn conclusion: Burger King is, or rather, the Whopper, Angus and Chicken Royale are just like their foreign counterparts.

Got there to find 3 people waiting in line with the counter closed and a sign on the monitor that the staff is on a '10 minute break' on account of isha namaz. Fair enough. The wait stretched to 15 minutes and the line stretched by a further 10 persons behind me, on to the road. At this point a couple of people left the line and I asked the guard how much longer, to which he replied \"Abhi to jamaat khari hee nahee huee, time lagayga\" pointing to the adjacent masjid. Not wanting to wait any longer, I left. Suggestion: Whereas I (or the customers) may understand that you want to close shop and attend prayers, and if this will take 30 mins end to end, just say so! No point in saying 10 mins and keep customers hanging. \n\nTook the car around the block to find Big Thick Burgers and placed my order there.

Picked the burgers up from the 'shack', and had the 'Full House' with Loaded Fries.  The order was ready in like 15 minutes, despite a lot of demand.  They were easily churning out a dozen burgers every 5 minutes.\n\nThe succulent beef patty was probably the best I've had this side of the Suez, and is clearly a couple of notches better than the standard burgers served by fast food joints, including international franchises.  The bun-patt ratio was just perfect, and the buns were fresh.  The condiments were not overflowing, and complemented the overall taste.  And finally the price was pretty reasonable, relative to burgers served by fast food franchises.  Not much to write about fries -- they were just the usual fries, cut in a fancy way.  It will be great if they can provide a choice of burger buns as well!\n\nThe burger can't really compete with gourmet burgers, but its probably the best fast food burger out there, and definitely way better than the eagerly awaited Burger King, and the now mini-Mac of McDonalds.  Hardees is in a different league though, as the patty there is charbroiled. \n\nOverall, a good experience.  Would rate it at 8/10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-04T01:06:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-04T20:00:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"512577683","name":"Salik Sajid"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"810870516","name":"Talha Sufi"},{"id":"901860640","name":"Mohammad Rafil"},{"id":"557576643","name":"Shariq Riaz"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"1579891410","name":"Erum Siddiqui"},{"id":"712751198","name":"Zareen Sultan"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"547005284","name":"Adeel Azhar"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"593385155","name":"Mubashir Zuberi"},{"id":"828050472","name":"Maisam Ali"},{"id":"568465423","name":"Yasir Hasan"},{"id":"500172130","name":"Agha Hamza Pathan"},{"id":"544070599","name":"Farhan Saleem"},{"id":"1285044693","name":"Sami Ibrahim Tamimi"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"600961078","name":"Azzah Sharif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAwOTYxMDc4","before":"NTEyNTc3Njgz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"597862913598196","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"nice review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-04T03:02:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597868500264304","from":{"name":"Em Jay","id":"100000065623735"},"message":"Onion rings are much better than their ordinary fries","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-04T03:22:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597869446930876","from":{"name":"Adnan Yasin","id":"723675110"},"message":"Every burger chain has its own uniqueness except for those who are completely waste of money.\n\nThose who are good ...have at least one burger of different type.\n\nHARDEE'S ......

Not just a minute or two late, but I got my orders in 45-55 minutes instead of the promised (maximum) 30 minutes. Each time I lodged complains, but the pathetic management did not pay heed. A week back, I ordered and as usual it came late so I returned the food. Tonight I ordered again (yes, it was quite stupid to order again) and told the order taker that I would NOT pay a rupee AND would take the order if it came even a minute late. To which he said that it would be there inside 30 minutes. \n\nAs usual, the order arrived in 48 minutes. I live on main Shahrae Faisal, max 5-8 min drive from the Tariq Road McDonalds. I told the rider and the manager (on phone) that I would not pay, as I had specifically told so to the order taker. The manager had the guts to ask his rider to stay outside my house as long as I don't pay. The guy waited there for 30 minutes before I paid him. \n\nMcDonalds is quite pathetic but I ordered since it is near my place and I was late for dinner. I assume that being food lovers, most of you don't eat it anyway, but if you do, I'd say stay away specially from ordering it! Pathetic service even by our extremely low standards.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-07T17:51:16+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-08T06:46:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"750185550","name":"Shayan Ali"},{"id":"100001523526000","name":"Anas Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNTIzNTI2MDAw","before":"NzUwMTg1NTUw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"568251243226030","from":{"name":"Farhan Sultan","id":"100000271785679"},"message":"How can u eat food without paying for it ????","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-07T17:53:20+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false},{"id":"568251356559352","from":{"name":"Saima Achria","id":"518308086"},"message":"why don't you try ordering from Urbanite Pk - u can choose from a number of different places online, there delivery time is typically on point","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-07T17:53:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100003613396124","name":"Urbanite Pk","type":"user","offset":32,"length":11}]},{"id":"568251409892680","from":{"name":"Faizan Mukarram","id":"1023815310"},"message":"I for one have never had a bad experience with mcdonalds delivery :/","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-07T17:53:53+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"568252029892618","from":{"name":"Asad V.

Had it been done, i would have opted to go for something else that day and get back to them later. the burger was fine, but the onion rings and fries were a challenge to chew, the staff there fried them for 30 minutes almost, and had my fingers soaked in cooking oil, where as the crumbs/coating on the onion rings was soooo hard (yes i mean hard) that i had to fight, pulling them with my teeth....and managing to give up and lose the battle. we had a take awaym considering they dont have a dine-in yet. i wanted to go back and challenge them to chew those hard rings, but wasnt able to manage it after i left that area...otherwise iv loved their burgers.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-31T16:46:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"564828926901595","from":{"name":"Zubair Aziz","id":"1627178378"},"message":"Try Burger Inc.

Initial impression: Clean, spare, light and airy. We were on a quick stopover, so 2 Americanos, one cupcake, one order of fries with garlic Mayo. Being the 'quiet zone' Nazi I am, asked the waiter to tone down the music, after which we settled in and sampled their fare. Coffee, taste 7/10, temperature 6/10, presentation 8/10. Fries; taste 8/10, quantity 9/10, presentation 9/10. Chatted with the young owner and got to find out more about the place/pricing/customer profile (its mostly women btw).

I had a feeling that all the beef burgers tasted the same o: Maybe it was just me? The delivery service had also started to suck .. The drink was not always was in a very impressive condition .. The fries they came up with used to be literally ice-cold and nearly impossible to swallow without the drink. The buns were stale and most of the times the drink used to spill all over the burger making the bun sweet and soggy but guess what? That was an old story c: Just ordered 'The Turkish' I guess their limited edition burger. The food was received with in twenty five minutes where as the limit was forty five minutes (y). The drink was ice cold and the orangy fanta flavour was still intact .. The fries were super crispy and full of that salty kick .. Oh well the burger? It was a hit :) Pickles in nearly every other bite .. Crunchy ice berg with a heavenly taste of that tangyy mayo .. The patty was huge .. Bigger than the bun (y).

Miss Farah hosts these elaborate dinners and lunches at her house. \n\nwe were recommended this place by an Aunt of ours who raved about her food and the place. The place has just two options 1500 per head set menu or 1700 the only difference between the two is the option to add seafood to the menu. \n\nwe went with the 1500 option which was to include 8 main dishes, luxurious salad, one starter guava drink, soup, water, soda drinks, tea/coffee and three different types of desserts. Sounds good doesn't it so far ?\n\nit wasn't just the menu we were impressed with it was also the ambiance which we were to be served in. Pool side for gents and hall way for ladies. \n\nBut as soon as booked and we gave our hefty advance payment things turned sour \nthe \"aunty\" farah introduced us to her manager Asma and said she will take care of you, that should have been hint for things to come.\n\nThe day of the party came and we hosts arrived early to check everything it started out smoothly all the guests were served with starter drinks ( although we had asked for the guava half were served with mix fruit drink and the other half guava ) no matter it wasn't so bad so we were good with it. Than everything came down like a house of cards the soup ( hot and sour was much better than cream of chicken but still pretty good ) and the salad bar opened service to gents first as there was only so much space to allow 30-35 people at once. the gents raved and went to the pool side we asked Asma to refill the salad and refill the soup. We were informed that there would be no refilling the salad as we only provide one serving ..... and soup was finished as it was just complimentary ( and although we had asked if she had any problem when making the booking we can count soup as one of our main dishes but were told that no i will not give any discount but this i can do)..... i was completely dumb struck and my wife knowing my anger said she will go speak to Miss Farah herself when she went to speak to her she was told very rudely that you are \" knit picking \" and your people are eating a lot. Not wanting to ruin the mood of the guests we served the ladies with half a bowl of cream of chicken soup and messy and almost empty salad ( and let me remind you this is for 1500 per head ) after a while they filled a few salad dishes the awesome coleslaw was replaced with chopped up lettuce and mayonnaise ( they made it up after alot of heated arguments ) which was just crap the tasteful salsa dipping sauce replaced with tasteless tomato sauce. anyhow we survived that we were asking Asma why isnt the water being served to the guests and by this point she was just freaking out and lashing out at us to stop saying anything to her she was like we serve guests the water after dinner ..... can you imagine. and there wasn't even mineral water bottles they were jugs of water. \n\nThe food came and i have to be honest in the whole experience food was the only bright spot in otherwise sorry of an excuse of a party hosted. Our dishes were \n1 lamb chops\n2 chicken lasania\n3 chicken manchurian\n4 Chinese fried rice\n5 Dry beef Chilli\n6 Chicken stuffed satays\n7 Chicken pepper steak\n8 Ginger Chicken\n\neach one was excellent no doubt. Once more we asked gents to take service first and by the middle of it some guests told me that the food is cold. AND THAN TO MY SURPRISE THE FIRE THAT IS SUPPOSE TO BE ON UNDERNEATH THE BUFFET DISHES WERE NOT ON AT ALL. and in my experience it is suppose to be on for at least and hour before the service they pour some water in the steel dish when putting the fire so as to steam the steel dish so when the food tray is kept on top it would keep the food steaming hot for at least another 30-40 minutes. And obviously once more the ladies were at the receiving end of it all they came for food other than the food refilled everything was ice cold and trust me when you are paying so much for a luxurious party you would get boiled up. And when tried to speak to Asma about she said \" i don't know what you are talking about this is the first time guests have complained so much \" really were the people before me just did not care for the food they ordered or how there guests were treated I highly doubt that. The women was under quiet the pressure than came the time to serve drinks there was nobody serving drinks or water all guests had to get up and take the drinks themselves in fact they were so understaffed we were serving the drinks ourselves to the ladies. The lone guy in gents filling drinks and water for 30-35 people got really pissed off and told one of our guests asking for water that if you want water go in that alley way there is a cooler and go fill it yourself. Can you imagine your guests being told like that ?? Than came the time for dessert  we ordered the following : \n\n1 chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup\n2 caramel custard\n3 Blue berry cheese cake sort of thing\n\nfirst we got all three desserts and they were lip smacking good all three of them than again by this point it was no surprise at all they had only made so much that only 15-20 gents could try these dishes let alone females. Than to add to the shock they brought store bought igloo vanilla and mango ice cream .... what kind of fools do they take us for i told Asma do you think we are stupid this is not what we ordered this is store bought and you have just bought it now. My assumption is they forgot for how many the party was for. than they also bought there left over kheer from maybe a party before. oooh and the best part is the bride for whom the party was hosted for had to wait 10 minutes for the dessert bowls to arrive to eat an igloo ice cream. She was polite enough to pretend she enjoyed it but my wife and i did not like looking at this situation after waiting for half an hour no coffee no tea and when just 30 guests left they bring out the tea and coffee with just 10 cups and saucers. let alone party of 70 they cannot even handle party of 30 i tell you. \n\nI don't know how these committee defense aunties thought this was a good place maybe they were small in numbers but apparently according to Miss Farah she has been doing this for over 2 years and hosted a maximum of 200 guests at a single given time. I highly doubt the 200 guests part. \n\nWe waited for the guests to leave in order to give her a piece of our mind there was not a sight of apology in fact the manager Asma apparently thought it was a big threat to us by telling us that her husband is a pathan as if we give a ....... Miss Farah after finding out everything told us the salad was enough for 70 .... i would like to tell her i dont give a **** what you think it wasn't enough for even 40 let alone to remind her it wasn't ala carte but a buffet. After reminding Miss Farah that asma failed to put the fire on the buffet dishes she scolded her a little and told us \" what do u want ? do u want me to apologize ? there i am sorry do u want my staff to apologize ? what are you looking for a discount ? \"\nSeriously women you embarrassed us in front of our guests our party was a total bust and this is all you could think about and not even a sincere apology.  When someone is willing to spend 1500 per head on a party they are not thinking about discounts you arrogant women. if it wasn't for my elders i wouldn't have given them a cent more than the half already paid in advance but they did not want any bad blood they simply paid around 1100 per head and left but what a disgrace. \n\nI DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE NOT EVEN FOR ONCE NO MATTER HOW SWEET THE WOMEN WAS AT THE START SHE WAS THE OPPOSITE AT THE PARTY ONCE ONLY SHE ADMITTED THE MISTAKE AND THAT AS IF WE WERE SOME BEGGARS. TRUST ME IT WAS WORST THAN DESCRIBED. IT MIGHT SEEM HARSH BUT THAT IS HOW IT WAS.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-29T09:03:28+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-31T11:35:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000879687062","name":"Ghazala Siddiqi"},{"id":"519619487","name":"Shajiaah Jafri Ahmad"},{"id":"704536123","name":"Muhammad Salman"},{"id":"717445135","name":"Rukaiya Karim"},{"id":"558346280","name":"Amber Faisal"},{"id":"698885102","name":"Aamir Ghaffar"},{"id":"1652751344","name":"Rameen Alvi"},{"id":"783100180","name":"Kumeil Hussain"},{"id":"890140023","name":"Madiha Rashid"},{"id":"689771441","name":"Riffat Fawad Bukhari"},{"id":"575820034","name":"Maheen Kamran"},{"id":"512868559","name":"Halima Sadia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEyODY4NTU5","before":"MTAwMDAwODc5Njg3MDYy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"480032612047894","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"oh my abdul shakoor.
