Was not expecting Karachi's weather to be this cold and windy. There was only one family before us and by the time we left only two more came. The place was largely empty. \n\nOrdered Chicken boneless karahi and spicy fish tikka along with paratha, garlic nan and roghni nan. \nThe food was superb. Karahi was better than many places I tried recently, and fish was also excellent. The prices are also reasonable, and food for 3 costed only Rs. 1,700.\n\nThey only need to improve on their service. They brought naans without a napkin and in that weather they turned cold pretty quickly. Had to ask for a napkin. They served fish and raita uncovered too. Otherwise, the staff was courteous and service quick. Overall a pretty good experience. Will definitely recommend.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-22T08:27:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-22T13:36:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"691642690","name":"Hira Tariq"},{"id":"762775146","name":"Syed Faraz Baqar"},{"id":"851800404","name":"Aamna Mansoor Badshah"},{"id":"601955407","name":"Rashid H Ansari"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"},{"id":"100001263140827","name":"Fahad Tariq Bhirya"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100006186248618","name":"Sehr Shaikh"},{"id":"1282983841","name":"Hamza Kapadia"},{"id":"100000720206680","name":"Shazia A.
