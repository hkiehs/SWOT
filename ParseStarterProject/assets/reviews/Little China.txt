Ended up at Peking (this AWKWARD Chinese place at Bahadurabad) and I have been forced to share my review since i spent ...oh sorry wasted 1600 bucks. P.S the following pictures and reviews are about to notify serious competition to Golden Dragon, Red Emperor, Ginsoy and Chairman Mao....\nThe burger qaum (DHA/Clifton residents) is set to dine in at pricey places! Well long live all u eateries.....u guys charge for hygiene, standard and items mentioned on your menus!\n\nSo me and Shahroz Ali visited PEKING....the place was really really really shady but fully crowded with families since it was a sunday night. To my utter disappointed, the moment i opened the menu, my jaw dropped wide open! Nothing for less than Rs.500. Since i found it way to awkward (thinking i wud have rather bin to Red Emperor or Ginsoy for Chinese Dine in) i thought i'd place my order. We ordered 1 Chicken Fried Rice, 1 Lemon Chicken and 1 Hot n Sour Soup. The waiter told the servings were for 2 and my heart sank further. (so i was about to have 250 k sabzi chawal. 250 ka laal paani and nimboo murgi for 250! My hard earned Quaid e Azam :'( ) The order arrived within  15 mins while I kept observing the place. The trays they used were the steel ones used at burns road k tikkay wale....Neways this is what I got\n\nHot N Sour Soup. Simply liquid Ketchup, loaded with Hara Dhania (coriander) for God knows what reason\nLemon Chicken : Boiled chicken, cornflour in the stock as the gravy and literally half a litre lemon juice along with more lemon slices compared to the chicken\nChicken fried rice: Tasteless, completely raw veges\n\nHad a few bites and eventually got it all packed, since it got really late...ended up at Indus for Biryani! The portions were actually scanty and...v tried this place just for the heck of it.....Never Again\nFor all those who thought i can never criticize a place, here it it. I never post reviews about my bad experiences since if i just like to let go off being mean, but this place got my pukes stuck within my throat only!
