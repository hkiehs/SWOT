Minutes before the iftar, ppl started coming in.\n\nSamosey and Dahi barey were stale (in the iftari items). Rather, samosey were mixed, as in stale and fresh.. :/\n\nI liked the Chholey, they were fresh and tasty! :D\n\nThen the buffet dinner, those so called 35 dishes lol\nHot n Sour - pathetic, as if someone dropped a bottle of ketchup in there by mistake\nManchurian - as above.. bad taste\nFish and Chips - I found a hair in their fish, that I politely handed over to the waiter. Fish tasted like it was fried in a million times recycled oil (hope it was edible oil)\nChicken lolipop - :/ it was LOL-iPop, not hot or anything and not tasty at all\nSteak - the only thing i could eat. it was fairly well, but not as hot as it should have had been.\n\nI didnt try everything there, since the more I tried, the more i lost interest in eating.\n\nJumping towards the end, they brought me the comment card. I expressed what I felt like, upon which the head waiters manager (a lady) and their another head waiter or someone came to me, asking about the comments. I explained but they kept on begging, so I asked for another comment card and gave a good feedback, cause they were pretty much concerned!\n\nIm attaching the other comment card that I actually had written. (I kept it, and didnt give it back, despite their attempts)\n\nService, as in courtesy of the staff, is good. Food, pathetic!\nIts a BIG NO to Capsicum.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-15T22:54:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-16T21:30:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"541180758","name":"Hannia Waqar Shah"},{"id":"634991065","name":"Shazya Iftekhar"},{"id":"551195654","name":"Ali Daud"},{"id":"504621889","name":"Aisha Nadeem"},{"id":"100003495204029","name":"Noman Faysal"},{"id":"614747510","name":"Tariq Hameed Siddiqui"},{"id":"524740437","name":"Ahsan Khawaja"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI0NzQwNDM3","before":"NTQxMTgwNzU4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"586400714744416","from":{"name":"Ahsan Khawaja","id":"524740437"},"message":"Thats bad...:(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-15T22:57:03+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"586403821410772","from":{"name":"Tariq Hameed Siddiqui","id":"614747510"},"message":"Disappointed with the food quality, expected so much better!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-15T23:04:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"586409338076887","from":{"name":"Saadia Tariq","id":"567975179"},"message":"I hope that's a fictitious mobile # or Ms Shazia Gondal's number just appeared on  thousands of ppl's fb notifications home","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-15T23:16:01+0000","like_count":17,"user_likes":false},{"id":"586410244743463","from":{"name":"Ahsan Khawaja","id":"524740437"},"message":"lolx","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-15T23:18:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"586416871409467","from":{"name":"Ahsan Mateen","id":"517894082"},"message":"Zoha Sohail hahahahah ;) check this out!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-15T23:23:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1476330208","name":"Zoha Sohail","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"586417134742774","from":{"name":"Tariq Hameed Siddiqui","id":"614747510"},"message":"Haha anyone who'd call that number is in for a surprise! ;) These are consolidated contact details of all three of us.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-15T23:24:26+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false},{"id":"586417324742755","from":{"name":"Zahid Qureshi","id":"1560344939"},"message":"Ms. Saadia Tariq its been taken care of. lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-15T23:25:14+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"586419094742578","from":{"name":"Zahid Qureshi","id":"1560344939"},"message":"Tariq Hameed Siddiqui next time, evaluate the options wisely! lol lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-15T23:28:37+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"614747510","name":"Tariq Hameed Siddiqui","type":"user","offset":0,"length":21}]},{"id":"586420311409123","from":{"name":"Saadia Tariq","id":"567975179"},"message":"Oh drat, there goes the free meal opportunity!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-15T23:31:17+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"586438524740635","from":{"name":"Tariq Hameed Siddiqui","id":"614747510"},"message":"Xahyd I suggested capsicum based on a couple of reviews I read on this forum.
