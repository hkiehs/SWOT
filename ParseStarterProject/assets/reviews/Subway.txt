For sure, teething problems on the operations side and a limited menu. However, the Whopper with Cheese was 80% like the burgers that I have eaten at BK in other countries. The main difference being that this was more well done and a touch drier than the prior experiences. That may be a personal thing since I also eat my steak medium rare! The basic taste of the burger was the flame grilled rather than fried that I prefer but it did seem a tad hastily prepared. My sense is that within a short period of time, the minor issues that exist will be ironed out and BK will be the same in Karachi as it is for an occasional fast food indulgence abroad.\n\nPreviously, my biggest complaint, and main reason why BK was not usually in my fast food options, were the fries. The new BK fries are 300% better than before and were a pleasant surprise! No, not quite as good as McDonalds or OPTP but pretty darned good ... and I even think they will be better in a few days!! I didn't try the Pepsi but was told by a member of my dining group that it was quite good.\n\nAgain, please keep in mind that my positive comments do not seek to compare a fast food burger to the exceptional offerings that can be had at restaurants such as Forty4. For a fast food burger, I personally prefer the Whopper to the Big Mac... and might think about trying the Angus version too. So, all in all, happy to have BK here in Karachi as another dining option.\n\nFinally, the Dolmen Mall food scene has truly become something special with tons and tons of reputable options for quick food as well as restaurants. Others may differ in their opinion, and I respect that, however I am quite pleased!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-07T14:04:53+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-08T05:20:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"633230637","name":"Mahnaz Hadi"},{"id":"850785116","name":"Iruj Khawaja"},{"id":"527720164","name":"Sara Khan"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"100004201268402","name":"Shakil Ahmed"},{"id":"524548090","name":"Saba Shaikh"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"514079467","name":"Noor Rehman"},{"id":"794615955","name":"Adnan Qureshi"},{"id":"739067064","name":"Rakhshanda Khan"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"530485619","name":"Hana Faisal"},{"id":"514492150","name":"Syed Adeel Rizvi"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"864470709","name":"Syed Muhammad Taha Askari"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"100000223684855","name":"Sana A.

To my surprise, in less than hour after I commented, I got a phonecall from a Food Panda manager by the name of Haya, who was very apologetic and sincere, and repeatedly said that she hoped I'd try Food Panda again and not have any complaints this time. I was pretty impressed by their diligence so today, I decided to give FP another chance. I ordered two sandwiches from Petaco's via FP, my total bill was Rs. 755. I gave the rider exactly Rs. 780, and instead of giving me Rs. 5 change, he asks for Rs. 50 more. I'm very dreamy-minded and tend to miss the obvious so I checked the bill, and asked why I had to give Rs. 50 more. The rider then says that those Rs. 50 charges are for HIS delivery. Like, I already paid Rs. 100 for delivery, but the rider gets a special Rs. 50 tip. I called up FP and they picked up after MUCH delay. Thankfully I wasn't passed from one rep to another, they were prompt in getting someone to talk to me and I explained what was going on. The rep apologized and said I didn't need to pay any more amount at all and he'd call the rider and speak to him. The rider didn't even return the Rs. 5 he owed me, btw. And I know the trolls will be commenting here saying its just Rs. 5, etc. but I'm more pissed off on an ethical level. This was my third time ordering from Food Panda and honestly, one or two hiccup here and there is normal, I've had them with Urbanite as well but this is just the limit! If anyone is thinking of trying out Food Panda, DON'T! At least Urbanite will respond to you and apologize and their bad hiccups happen once or twice. Food Panda hiccups with each order, and the severity of their problems only increases with each incident.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-12T16:07:07+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-14T21:11:29+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1324057559","name":"Safi Ahmed"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1497320748","name":"Fauzia Farhan Hashmat"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"507563555","name":"Sara Omran"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"783958571","name":"Rabia Rajput"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"1406140922","name":"Sufyan Khan"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"100004754324237","name":"Usman Kabir"},{"id":"554875549","name":"Imran Siddiqui"},{"id":"882650316","name":"Sabah Shaikh"},{"id":"100001565357082","name":"Sinan Charania"},{"id":"605974561","name":"Aneeba F.

If you dont waste time on the road then you can have your evening tea at PTDC Motel in Bahawalpur. If you are staying at PTDC, they do a decent dinner as well but more adventurous food options are available inside Farid Gate and near fawara chowk. Next morning PTDC will do a good early breakfast for  you. If you are taking the detor off the N5 towards Kabirwala, Shorkot, Jhang to join the motorway from Faisalabad, then you can have lunch at Bhera services which has a number of options including a KFC, a Subway and a Berrylicious. You will reach Islamabad by sunset. My favourite eating places in Isloo are Omar Khayyam and Kabul also Polo Lounge and Des Pardes in Saidpur village. If you start early next morning then you can have lunch at Balakot, there is this place  by the Kunhar River just after you cross the bridge I dont remember the name but great Karahi. There will be a great temptation to stop at Abshar Cafe at Kawai to have tea/cold drinks and pakoras with your feet in ice cold mountain stream, but it would best left for the return journey if you are going all the way to Naran and not stoping at Shogran. Plenty of eating options at Naran but not many beyond the usual chicken karahi, for trout its best to eat at PTDC Naran, or at one of the Pine Park hotels in the valley (the best being the riverside property at Khania.

Its clearly mentioned on the flyers that its free delivery. The deal commences at 11pm & ends at 1am. \nThe surprising part is that this 'additional fee' is not the same for every branch & doesn't vary according to the distance of ur location from the branch. The branch farther from my house charges lesser than the branch that's hardly 3 minutes drive from my house. When I probed as to what this additional charge consists of, I was told its just a fee that I have to pay, without any reason & where they charge Rs. 60 on midnight deal delivery, they wud be fine even if I pay Rs. 50 or 40 even. To confirm if this was justified, I called up KDA branch & asked them y I was being made to pay this charge which had no purpose & was not fixed or even mentioned anywhere on the flyers or menu cards. The staff at the KDA branch said that the Bahadurabad branch maybe charging me this 'additional fee' because they 'felt like it' and 'unho ne aisay he boldya hoga!!' They assured me that no subway outlet was charging this fee and next time I should place my order with the KDA branch. I did that last night & they too charged me the extra charges that they have never been able to explain to me. When I told them about my conversation with them last time, they said 'madam aisa actually hota nahe hai, chalein aaap 40 rupees dey dein! Without it they wudnt deliver any midnight meals.

Have had Fuchsia couple of times in the past week followed by the ever tantalising and unparallelled chicken biryani from none other than Cafe Students. Today it was Chinese. Frequent diners at Golden Dragon have spoken really high about this place so I decided to give in & let G.D play with my taste buds. Today was the second time I ordered in from there. I didnot find the deals attractive since I'm not a fan of atleast 2 out of the 4 dishes they offer in those deals. So, I selected & ordered 3 dishes from their menu online: The ever famous American Chopsuey, Kung Pao Chicken (on basis of strong recommendations by family & friends alike) along with a Thai item, Chicken in Coconut Red Curry. Food was delivered exactly in the one hour time that was communicated to me. The rider (unlike the ones at most of the other food delivery restaurants) had no problem locating my address. As per my instructions, the rider did not ring the door bell, instead called on the mobile number fed in the restaurant's computer system. (This was worth mentioning because I've experienced some major mishaps with riders from Dominos, Mc Donalds, Subway etc. ringing my doorbell & calling my name inspite of having the order takers make special note to NOT ring the doorbell, as it would awake my entire family in the middle of the night, & instead to call on my cell once they are at my doorstep; but all efforts in vain!)\n\n Anyways, food as expected, was delivered piping hot, in the most convenient packaging. It looked & tasted scrumptuous! The quantity was sufficient for 5 people. Family loved every bite of it & endlessly sang praises! Beginning from the order taker whose cooperative behavior & courtesy makes u feel cared for, to the chefs & service staff in charge, till the rider who assures ur delivered the ordered items in perfect timing & perfect condition,, Golden Dragon, ur doing a WOW job! When I'm baffled with what to order, you come in at the right time and make life easier! Got to tell u, u ROCK!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-10T21:02:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-11T15:46:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000522564819","name":"Imran Bahadur"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"849555062","name":"Hira Aslam"},{"id":"1258402550","name":"Ateeka Ovais"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQ1MzkwMTMxMw\u003d\u003d","before":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"411511492233340","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Thanks for the lovely review and kind words.
