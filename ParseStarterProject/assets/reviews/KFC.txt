And warm. \n\nThankyou KFC for destroying my tastebuds and not even filling my tummy. *hunts the fridge*","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-09T14:25:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-12T17:13:10+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002945595749","name":"Hasanaat Tahir"},{"id":"100000579313166","name":"Xobi Shah"},{"id":"827180267","name":"DrJoyo Tabsheer"},{"id":"838344921","name":"Wajeeh Hasan"},{"id":"525691598","name":"Zohaib Waqar"},{"id":"1747519106","name":"Aimen Asad Gill"},{"id":"100001262753914","name":"Musti Khan"},{"id":"100001259041364","name":"Foziya Mobeen"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"1781512632","name":"Vishal Preetam"},{"id":"537012748","name":"Abdul Ahad Parekh"},{"id":"516120343","name":"Kiran Majid"},{"id":"524665437","name":"Saher Najam"},{"id":"100001252885971","name":"Marium Sultana"},{"id":"100000223684855","name":"Sana A.

So I guess they can be forgiven if the quality not consistent at this time. At the same time I believe that the owners of BK same as Pizza Hut. Judging from the sad decline of Pizza Hut over the past years (especially past year) I hope they don't do the same with BK.

That's what going into the food business is all about: It's about returning that kindness and trust someone has for you and responding with the best quality possible for that money. I can't judge BK until I try it myself (maybe in a week or so when the crowds lessen a bit). Let's see how it goes. P.s. Have been a McDonald's fan ever since a kid and although we know the barrage of criticism and jokes McDonald's gets in the commercial aspect I respect them because they always maintain the quality and product, and that's especially important here in Pakistan. Only once or twice I had a bad experience with McDonald's here (stale bun) in many years. A friend of mine from L.A. who owns 3-4 Taco Bells, KFC's and a Pizza Hut there had McDonald's here and said it was far superior to any McDonald's in the US (the halal beef probably helps).","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-08T06:10:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"630288763688944","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"Why do people in our country in particular compare and expect the taste to be the same worldwide?

Though their was no line when i went, only 3 ladies and one man still the counter was relatively crowded and two managers were arguing pretty loudly with each other in full view of the customers, and the ppl who were supposed to take the order were counting cash.\n\nAnyways finally ordered a whopper and chicken burger both meals. The whopper looked very unimpressive, it was cold, patty was super thin and dry and tasteless even the KFC frozen patty is better, total disappointment. I don't know what all this hype is about, the whopper is a disappointment, the chicken burger is like a sub, patty is decent and well flavored, was served hot and much better than beef. The fries were limp and bland, total turnoff. I have not tried the Argus Steak House but will try it soon, maybe that may fares better on my scale.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-08T11:09:17+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-08T11:09:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTU0MjY2OTM5Mg\u003d\u003d","before":"MTU0MjY2OTM5Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"restaurantName":"KFC"},{"id":"165861103465048_629971923720628","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Burger King gets a B+ today. For sure, teething problems on the operations side and a limited menu. However, the Whopper with Cheese was 80% like the burgers that I have eaten at BK in other countries. The main difference being that this was more well done and a touch drier than the prior experiences. That may be a personal thing since I also eat my steak medium rare! The basic taste of the burger was the flame grilled rather than fried that I prefer but it did seem a tad hastily prepared. My sense is that within a short period of time, the minor issues that exist will be ironed out and BK will be the same in Karachi as it is for an occasional fast food indulgence abroad.\n\nPreviously, my biggest complaint, and main reason why BK was not usually in my fast food options, were the fries. The new BK fries are 300% better than before and were a pleasant surprise! No, not quite as good as McDonalds or OPTP but pretty darned good ... and I even think they will be better in a few days!! I didn't try the Pepsi but was told by a member of my dining group that it was quite good.\n\nAgain, please keep in mind that my positive comments do not seek to compare a fast food burger to the exceptional offerings that can be had at restaurants such as Forty4. For a fast food burger, I personally prefer the Whopper to the Big Mac... and might think about trying the Angus version too. So, all in all, happy to have BK here in Karachi as another dining option.\n\nFinally, the Dolmen Mall food scene has truly become something special with tons and tons of reputable options for quick food as well as restaurants. Others may differ in their opinion, and I respect that, however I am quite pleased!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-07T14:04:53+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-08T05:20:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"633230637","name":"Mahnaz Hadi"},{"id":"850785116","name":"Iruj Khawaja"},{"id":"527720164","name":"Sara Khan"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"100004201268402","name":"Shakil Ahmed"},{"id":"524548090","name":"Saba Shaikh"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"514079467","name":"Noor Rehman"},{"id":"794615955","name":"Adnan Qureshi"},{"id":"739067064","name":"Rakhshanda Khan"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"530485619","name":"Hana Faisal"},{"id":"514492150","name":"Syed Adeel Rizvi"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"864470709","name":"Syed Muhammad Taha Askari"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"100000223684855","name":"Sana A.

Well they said it for some reason surely.\n\nSattar Buksh with its catchy name and riding high on the internet media publicity and that too very creatively I have to give it to them the creativity behind SB is something out of your marketing text book. So the name is catchy it was very successful in creating the hype so how did it fare ? \n\nWell firstly the environment I would like the name of the interior designer and the architect it was so in sync with the name and the place. And they did a wonderful job and creating spaces where you don?t feel like you are all eating together with every other table in the house but rather how a caf? should be something espresso caf? and others could learn from. The flooring the walls the ceilings the artwork it isn't too much in your face yet not to subtle keeping it in line with the name. \nWell since it?s a caf? let me first talk about the chai and coffee. I think the elachi chai was amazing pretty good as good as the best chai dabas around in a comfortable environment but than again I don?t think I would be used to paying for 175 + tax for a mere cup of tea I mean you may have had it in your meetings in five star hotels but going for a casual cup of tea for 175+ is a big no no for me but heck I might go maybe but not for the tea probably for the coffee maybe because I love coffee more than my chai and they seriously did have pretty good coffee just the right temperature I had managed to try both hot and cold both were up to standard of your Gloria jeans or any other international coffee shop, priced similarly but I wouldn't go there in so much rush maybe when it dies down. \n\nHowever that is where it all goes downhill I seriously question if the idea is for  caf? or a restaurant because if they plan to make their earnings based on it being a restaurant with people occasionally ordering tea and coffee it is bound to fail they should immediately hire a new chef or something because the food is ridiculous no offence intended to anyone but the food was pathetic they don?t know how to make a pizza, a Panini in SB?s definition is a big fat loaf of bread with a bit of stuffing inside ( try butlers any given day and you will know what a Panini is ) butler is a nice example here they are not too fancy about their food but what they serve is pretty good. We were six people so I will tell the other four dishes the besharam burger again a very catchy name kudos to the guy who thought of it love the idea but the execution I have had burgers with sunny side up eggs in them but the chicken its bland no not just bland its pathetic to put it in your kitchen. Now the so called Bolognese roast burger seriously I know you guys want to be desi / angrez all at once and you have even kept the menu of bun kababs but this Bolognese burger was in the angrez section why did it taste like a bun kabab ? And not the good kind  either. Stuffed chicken penne pasta, admittedly the stuffed chicken was good but the pasta are you kidding I have made better pastas in my university days without even trying too hard. Stuffed Chicken with rice was nice because of one reason only was the chicken was the same as the pasta and that was nice. The waiter forgot our jeengalala dish which we thanked god for because after such disappointments I don?t think we could have bared another one. \n\nSheesha the only reason I mention sheesha in a separate section Is because I am big fan so I know what I am talking about well the sheeshas were nice very hygienic lots of options but 900+ tax for a sheesha I mean nowhere in Karachi have I had such an expensive sheesha. This is beyond expensive it?s a sheesha for gods sake the whole cost of making one is less than 100 rupees. Heck one whole sheesha itself costs you 3000 rupees 900+ tax for a sheesha is ridiculous Arabian or pink cadilac or for ppl of mohd ali good ol fakhir. \n\nService; well given the place was jam packed you could be forgiven for delay in service but what is unforgivable that the waiters don?t have a pen or pad to remember their orders I heard a few around me complaint about their orders and one of our dishes completely went missing when the food arrived.\n\nMy parting words I like what you are trying to do is a fusion between west and east, chai and coffee, burger and bunkabab but please change your food menu keep dishes on the light side rather than dishes with rice keep decent sandwiches nice pastas . Bring your price to a reasonable range because people might come for the hype but they need something else to come back for even those who have money to burn. But you never know Road Side caf? is still in business you might too with the same menu.As only SB can put it let me give it a try \" free advice hai leny hai tou lo warna tel lo \"","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-15T14:54:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T11:05:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"686500226","name":"Maira Uzair"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"61407780","name":"Zahrah Sehr Vayani"},{"id":"100000674735601","name":"Muhammad Patel"},{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"542900496","name":"Amal Anis Makda"},{"id":"1014345458","name":"Sadek Motiwala"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"630510285","name":"Azeem Afzal Motiwala"},{"id":"100003205271578","name":"Mahnoor Mukhtar"},{"id":"1292953231","name":"Aakash Kumar"},{"id":"597946799","name":"Alishba Shah"},{"id":"512868559","name":"Halima Sadia"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"701530707","name":"Zubia Ilyas"},{"id":"892195391","name":"Tehreem Fatima"},{"id":"647225359","name":"Sana Javeri"},{"id":"535320159","name":"Muhammad Saqib Khan"},{"id":"504319826","name":"Sarah Masood"},{"id":"1364547192","name":"Rabya Sultan"},{"id":"577409061","name":"Maaz Jamal"},{"id":"100003917951343","name":"Kiran Jabeen"},{"id":"672460650","name":"Yousuf Ali Sayeed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcyNDYwNjUw","before":"Njg2NTAwMjI2"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_619166518134502/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjcyNDYwNjUw"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619168601467627","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Omg...

Originally my family and I wanted to go and have sehri at bbq tonight but there was a 20-30 minute waiting and since it was already like 3 in the am we decided against it. Ended up going to boat basin and the family members wanted to have handi/saalan type food we ended up going to Nihari Inn. I, personally was not fond of this place as is because I had gotten food poisoning the first time I ate here which was around 6 years ago. But the second experience was the cherry on top. Ordered the boneless chicken handi which tasted like chicken karahi..when we asked the waiter he said it was chicken karahi cooked in a handi.. Then we asked the manager and HE said it was infact chicken handi cooked in a karahi! Wth? Ordered the dhaaga wala kabab.. Which i didnt have because I dont like it. But according to my family it was good. Ordered plain nan and when I asked for garlic naan the manager was like we dont have that here.. Dude how hard is it to make garlic naan?? And I ordered the boneless chicken boti. The boti was ok but too spicy and there was no salad with it. The dhaga wala kabab didnt have salad either..upon enquiry we were told that the salad was infact the bowl of onions on our table and that too for both of our dishes COMBINED. When the waiter asked for drinks I ordered pepsi and he told us sorry sir pepsi thandi nahi hai but I let that go and ordered a mountain dew. Aaaaaand that wasnt cold either -_- Never going back there again! I prefer Chick n Chips over this place anytime of the day now!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-07T23:51:35+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-08T21:04:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"509209694","name":"Sheheryar Khan"},{"id":"100000383834376","name":"Hamza S.

I ignored all this as I can understand that they were fasting and these kind of things do happen mean while they both stopped and my food was ready I took it and went to home. When we started to eat during Iftar time I must tell you that some chicken pieces were really under cooked of the rice n spice and were not in a condition to chew, as we are peace lovers :p so we just ate the rice and some cooked chicken pieces and threw rest of them in the bin. I did go after Iftar and conveyed my message to the supervisor he told me calmly \"sir if you could bring those boxes I can give you another one\" I said I don't want them I just wanted to bring this thing into your knowledge.\n\nI guess that loud argument made other chefs under pressure or their concentration got diverted as a result the consumer suffered so my message to the managers/supervisors is that you should always handle the situation calmly that's why you are a manager you have to manage things within the limited resources. I told the supervisor the same thing and he was embarrassed and he also apologized me.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-26T19:32:22+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-26T23:32:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"609252981","name":"Ross Wahid"},{"id":"100001089240373","name":"Abdul Basit Sivany"},{"id":"650275419","name":"Rafida Bader"},{"id":"822260471","name":"Arisha H Qureshi"},{"id":"860510556","name":"Sabeen Qamar"},{"id":"1340156857","name":"Rohail Karimi"},{"id":"100000904344944","name":"Usman Akhter"},{"id":"100001081337199","name":"Ali Saeed"},{"id":"520882045","name":"Ghulam Ali"},{"id":"517361095","name":"Muhmmad Mehdi Siddiq"},{"id":"685820726","name":"Mehmood Hamid Hussain"},{"id":"653913361","name":"Ahmed I Mehanti"},{"id":"577409061","name":"Maaz Jamal"},{"id":"652430244","name":"Afira Faisal"},{"id":"854470690","name":"Sadiqain Khoja"},{"id":"750786806","name":"Faixa Shah"},{"id":"846205643","name":"Natasha Owais"},{"id":"1368416951","name":"Muhammad Jamal"},{"id":"623976190","name":"Zurva Salman Hasan"},{"id":"602924593","name":"Aneeta Nasir"},{"id":"676581807","name":"Erum Adil Gul"},{"id":"1178325277","name":"Dania Asim"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"622532960","name":"Ayesha Qureshi"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI5MzYxNzk3","before":"NjA5MjUyOTgx"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_593013430749811/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjI5MzYxNzk3"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"593019120749242","from":{"name":"Aneeta Nasir","id":"602924593"},"message":"Bravo !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T19:51:56+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"593019387415882","from":{"name":"Erum Adil Gul","id":"676581807"},"message":"I had ordered zinger last week and it was under cooked and I called them they said to give the burger to the rider when he comes and they delivered in 15 minutes but this undercook thing happened thrice with me, KFC should take notice","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T19:52:54+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"593073920743762","from":{"name":"Mohammad Ahsan Dahar","id":"594590024"},"message":"kia baat hai Umer bhai,, aap toh hero nikle-- autograph dena! :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T21:09:03+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"849920390","name":"Umer","type":"user","offset":13,"length":4}]},{"id":"593074544077033","from":{"name":"Umer Rashid","id":"849920390"},"message":"lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T21:11:34+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"593183770732777","from":{"name":"Jehanzeb Aftab","id":"737997112"},"message":"well i guess you just costed the cook his job.. the manager was already pissed at him for some reason.. and you told him that he was serving the customers raw food..\nPretty sure he wont be there the next time you visit..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T22:41:07+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"593216994062788","from":{"name":"Talha Shahid","id":"668642026"},"message":"I wonder why people eat KFC in Pakistan.

Not just a minute or two late, but I got my orders in 45-55 minutes instead of the promised (maximum) 30 minutes. Each time I lodged complains, but the pathetic management did not pay heed. A week back, I ordered and as usual it came late so I returned the food. Tonight I ordered again (yes, it was quite stupid to order again) and told the order taker that I would NOT pay a rupee AND would take the order if it came even a minute late. To which he said that it would be there inside 30 minutes. \n\nAs usual, the order arrived in 48 minutes. I live on main Shahrae Faisal, max 5-8 min drive from the Tariq Road McDonalds. I told the rider and the manager (on phone) that I would not pay, as I had specifically told so to the order taker. The manager had the guts to ask his rider to stay outside my house as long as I don't pay. The guy waited there for 30 minutes before I paid him. \n\nMcDonalds is quite pathetic but I ordered since it is near my place and I was late for dinner. I assume that being food lovers, most of you don't eat it anyway, but if you do, I'd say stay away specially from ordering it!

If you dont waste time on the road then you can have your evening tea at PTDC Motel in Bahawalpur. If you are staying at PTDC, they do a decent dinner as well but more adventurous food options are available inside Farid Gate and near fawara chowk. Next morning PTDC will do a good early breakfast for  you. If you are taking the detor off the N5 towards Kabirwala, Shorkot, Jhang to join the motorway from Faisalabad, then you can have lunch at Bhera services which has a number of options including a KFC, a Subway and a Berrylicious. You will reach Islamabad by sunset. My favourite eating places in Isloo are Omar Khayyam and Kabul also Polo Lounge and Des Pardes in Saidpur village. If you start early next morning then you can have lunch at Balakot, there is this place  by the Kunhar River just after you cross the bridge I dont remember the name but great Karahi. There will be a great temptation to stop at Abshar Cafe at Kawai to have tea/cold drinks and pakoras with your feet in ice cold mountain stream, but it would best left for the return journey if you are going all the way to Naran and not stoping at Shogran. Plenty of eating options at Naran but not many beyond the usual chicken karahi, for trout its best to eat at PTDC Naran, or at one of the Pine Park hotels in the valley (the best being the riverside property at Khania. Plenty of local fruit available from roadside stalls.

Golden Dragon - My new love for Thai and Chinese food. Hot favourites: American Chopsuey, Crispy Beef, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Hot and Sour Soup, Thai Soup, Thai Green Curry, Wontons, Zingers and Chicken Karhai (the last two from their Lunch Xpress section)\n\n2. Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb's warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I'm not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away. Will go soon to be blown away by other things too.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-25T18:59:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-27T14:47:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"505164013","name":"Yasmeen Agad-Kothawala"},{"id":"515396294","name":"Danish Ali Dahraj"},{"id":"100003249618202","name":"Heer Ahmed"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"500907007","name":"Murtaza Moiz"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNjUxNzIy","before":"NjU3MDMxNzQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"404073356310487","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"i see myself featured here too, obliged and humbled Hajra Amir","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T19:33:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir","type":"user","offset":52,"length":10}]},{"id":"404123489638807","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Thank you Hajra :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T21:13:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra","type":"user","offset":10,"length":5}]},{"id":"404386042945885","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"These places are on my fingertips 24/7!!!

It was \"Shan-masala\" made.\n4. Daal - Didn't try\n5. Mix Sabzi - 10/10 Brilliant.\n6. Chicken Khara Masala - 5/10 Bland.\n7.Creamy Pasta - 3/10 Kept this for the last. Couldn't eat more than one bite. Too much methi or something, wasn't creamy or cheesy. Totally tasteless.\n8. Fried fish - 10/10 Delish!\n9. The soup - I don't know what soup it was but it wasn't good.\n\nFor Desserts:\n\n1. The caramel biscuit was my winner tonight. Soft and crumbly with a yummy biscuit base, it was just divine.\n2. Great caramel pudding....but then haven't seen ANYONE messing that up :)\n3. Chocolate pastry was nice. But a little dry.\n4. Mom loved the shahi tukra, the rasberry shortcake and the trifle.\n5. The blueberry cheesecake was awesome.\n6. Chocolate souffl?' - nice and airy\n\nOverall, a great time at the place but having said that, it didn't match up to the high KFC gave me yesterday :D LOL!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-27T19:52:39+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-27T20:14:13+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"643405172","name":"Sarah Ashraf"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI1OTY4OTUz","before":"MTAwMDAyMzc0OTE3MDM5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"387319667985856","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"yes the fish is delicious!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-27T20:14:13+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzg3MzE5NjY3OTg1ODU2","before":"Mzg3MzE5NjY3OTg1ODU2"}}},"restaurantName":"KFC"},{"id":"165861103465048_385816134802876","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"DEALS AT LUNCH XPRESS.....","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-25T08:31:00+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-25T08:58:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"650981818","name":"Salima Aziz"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"676000707","name":"Tasneem Murtazaalibhai"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA5ODQwOTE3MQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NjUwOTgxODE4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"385821461469010","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"Qamarunnisa Asim can i have u guys as my suppliers, these are killer prices, Sarwat Najam lunch for u","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-25T08:45:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","type":"user","offset":0,"length":16},{"id":"100000251252445","name":"Sarwat Najam","type":"user","offset":77,"length":12}]},{"id":"385824571468699","from":{"name":"Saeed Jamal Tariq","id":"100000444703801"},"message":"Isnt 'Zinger' a brand registered by KFC ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-25T08:52:13+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"385824964801993","from":{"name":"Tasneem Murtazaalibhai","id":"676000707"},"message":"i was about  ti  right that   there was  a time  when zinger  word only showed  up on kfc menus  but now  even  a  bun kabab  wala is now making  a zinger burger :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-25T08:53:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"385825244801965","from":{"name":"Tasneem Murtazaalibhai","id":"676000707"},"message":"Qamarunnisa Asim is lunch xpress urs too if it is  i got ot try the burgers","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-25T08:54:54+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","type":"user","offset":0,"length":16}]},{"id":"385825881468568","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Tasneem Murtazaalibhai:yes, it is :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-25T08:58:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"676000707","name":"Tasneem Murtazaalibhai","type":"user","offset":0,"length":22}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzg1ODI1ODgxNDY4NTY4","before":"Mzg1ODIxNDYxNDY5MDEw"}}},"restaurantName":"KFC"},{"id":"165861103465048_384715174912972","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"Need some assistance, i plan sending crispy fries instead of regular fries on all take away and delivery orders.

The pastries over there were divine , I had the rasberry cheescake and the caramel eclairs WOWZA! They're pretty pricey at around SAR 10 - 15 a piece but totally worth it. You can also buy a cup of Coffee over there , so it makes for a great breakfast. There are loads of small ghetto-ish looking Turkish Cafe's in Makkah they do awesome \"Doner Kebabs\" \"Iskander Kebabs\" and \"Qabsa\" definitely head to one of them ask any local in the city where the nearest \"MATAM TURKIYE\"  (Arabic for Turkish Restaurant) is . There are a bunch of Sudanese and various African run establishments slightly away from the Haram circle look for the signs saying \"FUUL\" (in Arabic) , just for being adventurous try Fuul its like an African delicacy made of beans, chickpeas and various spices .  If by any chance you start to miss Pakistani food head to the Hotel Ravi in Madinah its right across the street from Al Baik if I am not wrong there's only one Al Baik in Madinah. OMG that place does the best Pakistani food I've had outside Pakistan , great Chicken Karahi , Chicken Achari and by far the best Lassi I've ever had (seriously even Lahore couldn't beat it ).

The pastries over there were divine , I had the rasberry cheescake and the caramel eclairs WOWZA! They're pretty pricey at around SAR 10 - 15 a piece but totally worth it. You can also buy a cup of Coffee over there , so it makes for a great breakfast. There are loads of small ghetto-ish looking Turkish Cafe's in Makkah they do awesome \"Doner Kebabs\" \"Iskander Kebabs\" and \"Qabsa\" definitely head to one of them ask any local in the city where the nearest \"MATAM TURKIYE\"  (Arabic for Turkish Restaurant) is . There are a bunch of Sudanese and various African run establishments slightly away from the Haram circle look for the signs saying \"FUUL\" (in Arabic) , just for being adventurous try Fuul its like an African delicacy made of beans, chickpeas and various spices .  If by any chance you start to miss Pakistani food head to the Hotel Ravi in Madinah its right across the street from Al Baik if I am not wrong there's only one Al Baik in Madinah. OMG that place does the best Pakistani food I've had outside Pakistan , great Chicken Karahi , Chicken Achari and by far the best Lassi I've ever had (seriously even Lahore couldn't beat it ). One word of advice the best food in both of the cities is in areas slightly away from the respective Haram circles.

We ordered the mutton raan, mash ki daal, brain masala, seekh kebab, palak gosht, mutton handi green masala, and steam roast chicken?.yes a bit over the top for five people but we hadn't been in ages.  This came with a variety of naans and parathas.  The mash ki deal was truly legendary (the best i have ever had) and I have not used that term to describe many things. The mutton raan as expected was also really good!!! The seekh kebabs were below average and in fact we didn't even finish them :-(  The brain masala again a super hit, we ordered a second round of this as the quantity was a bit stingy?..the palak gosht I thought was spectacular but others at the table felt it was good and not beyond.  Mutton handi green masala again very good with the mutton just melting in your mouth.  The surprise hit of the day was the steam roast chicken?.I was expecting it to be very average but was completely blown away?it had some churan type masala on its coating which was quite addictive?the same type of addictive feeling you get when you start eating a pack of party slims chilli chips!!! All in all a great experience .. everyone must go and try all the dishes mentioned above minus the seekh kebab? and yes the place really needs to be done up again it is really lacking in the renovation department?.but then again a true foodie will always over look that and concentrate on the food!!!  After this went to TUC's to wash down all the goodies with the best Froyo's in town?had the natural and the chocolate and both hit the spot!!!!
