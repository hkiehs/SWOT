Another person came and gave Menu. We ordered food and they told us that it ll take 30 minuts after Iftaar,Iftar was free as they advertised, they served few things for Iftaar, iwe thought that person ll bring water or drink.... but we no1 bother to come back. So sad there was no water or any other drink.... and You can undrestand that literally we need Water after 15hr Fast\nHowever the place was not full But strange and unusual thing, they inform us after Iftaar that  \"Sorry sir its already finish\"\nServed food around 21:00 after asking again and again becoz we were not able to move any other place. Chicken Tikkah was not juicy and fresh. portion was SMALL, Food is pathetic.\nMy impression was their chef does not know how to cook! specially bbq, but they made their Food Menu to look fancy.\nThey could hardly notice us, took more 9 minuts to serve soft drinks..... and for more bread(naan) when we were waiting, a person came was holding a \"PR\" position with Lame Excuse. He had an unpleasant looking on everyone all the time. Took long time to serve Naan, Took long time to serve. \nThey also have deserts but we didn't even ordered and I can't say anything on this.\nThe service was absolutely disappointing. They were yelling each other  In addition they could hardly notice us when we wanted something (water, more Naan, the bill etc.). in the end waiter was demanding for more TIP\n\nWe spend almost 6000 Rupees (a little more than 1000Rs per person!) but the price is not comparable to the food and service - too much money. In conclusion the whole experience was  VERY BAD, I would never go again to this place for any reason and I don't recommend this restaurant, not even to my worst enemy.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-21T22:49:11+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-22T11:50:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"100002053607278","name":"Hammad Yawer"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"100004934224675","name":"Faisal Raza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDA0OTM0MjI0Njc1","before":"NTI0NDc2NzM1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"589930781058076","from":{"name":"Faisal Raza","id":"100004934224675"},"message":"u paid alot for some good crap my freind!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T22:54:35+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589936487724172","from":{"name":"Ali Faaiz","id":"717105405"},"message":"ya :(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T22:57:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589938001057354","from":{"name":"Hamzah Khan","id":"747525261"},"message":"That's a big waste of money!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T22:58:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589972447720576","from":{"name":"Dania Obaid-Naseem","id":"1241494164"},"message":"n not safe either!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T23:03:26+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589977267720094","from":{"name":"Ali Faaiz","id":"717105405"},"message":"Dania Obaid-Naseem very true bt for best food can go ...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T23:05:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1241494164","name":"Dania Obaid-Naseem","type":"user","offset":0,"length":18}]},{"id":"590068954377592","from":{"name":"Talha Idrees","id":"510349226"},"message":"I visited day before yesterday and had fabulous evening and waiter was also friendly and they did gave us free drink in iftaar...  :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T23:47:35+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590095061041648","from":{"name":"Yasir Hasan","id":"568465423"},"message":"Who with his sane mind will go to the freaking highway for iftar!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T23:59:09+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590095127708308","from":{"name":"Erum Siddiqui","id":"1579891410"},"message":"I guess waiters ko roza lag raha hoga ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T23:59:24+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590111951039959","from":{"name":"Agha Muhammad Asim","id":"100000669698315"},"message":"I disagreed\nI ve visitied in this ramzan,Food was good as usual and they served Iftar free as far as water concerned they gave us Rooh afza instead of water as you know water has some cost there.\nThere are large number of waiters on differnt shifts a one who served us was a nice man.\nI had many visit there every time i satisfied from there service\nI dont know how your experice is bad.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T00:05:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590271514357336","from":{"name":"Ali Faaiz","id":"717105405"},"message":"the person who told us about Al-Habib, was also sad after this kind of Great Service","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T07:02:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590279354356552","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"That is a horrible experience especially for iftari","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T07:31:32+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590279891023165","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"I always have a good experience at Al-Habib Highway................. never went for the iftar though.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T07:33:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590280881023066","from":{"name":"Ali Faaiz","id":"717105405"},"message":"Sajjad Naqvi u r lucky that never went Al-habib for Iftari...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T07:37:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590292631021891","from":{"name":"Rehan Latif","id":"547465214"},"message":"How can two people have such different experiences at the same restaurant. \nVery sorry to hear about how you were treated.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-22T08:31:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"590294747688346","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Rehan Latif the highway restaurants were famous for their great food but have always had poor service.
