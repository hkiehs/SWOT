I just happened to see the lines at BK at the Boat basin branch and just bamboozled by the rush. I will probably have to wait at least a couple of weeks before I can go with my family to sample BK. So I guess they can be forgiven if the quality not consistent at this time. At the same time I believe that the owners of BK same as Pizza Hut. Judging from the sad decline of Pizza Hut over the past years (especially past year) I hope they don't do the same with BK. The problem is many of these owners are only interested in profit or loss and not the passion or quality that makes a great eatery. Anyways, good luck to BK and I hope to visit them when the rush comes down.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-07T07:14:54+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"629875973730223","from":{"name":"Taimur Shaikh","id":"100004788035460"},"message":"best meal or deal cause I might be going","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-07T07:50:03+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"629875977063556","from":{"name":"Taimur Shaikh","id":"100004788035460"},"message":"best meal or deal cause I might be going","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-07T07:50:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"629876050396882","from":{"name":"Taimur Shaikh","id":"100004788035460"},"message":"best meal or deal cause I might be going today bk..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-07T07:50:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"629899763727844","from":{"name":"Rabia Tariq","id":"100002509519038"},"message":"Just came back with my whopper from BK  a huge disappointment  the opposite of succulent juicy and thick :(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-07T09:46:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"629900467061107","from":{"name":"Mazahir Ali","id":"520175866"},"message":"Rabia Tariq Not their fault there are a lot of people lined up there.

If BK owned by the same people who owned Pizza Hut then its bad news unless they totally revamp their quality control and dedication to providing a top quality product for a customer who had the kindness, courtesy and trust to part with his/her money for a reasonable dining experience. That's what going into the food business is all about: It's about returning that kindness and trust someone has for you and responding with the best quality possible for that money. I can't judge BK until I try it myself (maybe in a week or so when the crowds lessen a bit). Let's see how it goes. P.s. Have been a McDonald's fan ever since a kid and although we know the barrage of criticism and jokes McDonald's gets in the commercial aspect I respect them because they always maintain the quality and product, and that's especially important here in Pakistan. Only once or twice I had a bad experience with McDonald's here (stale bun) in many years. A friend of mine from L.A. who owns 3-4 Taco Bells, KFC's and a Pizza Hut there had McDonald's here and said it was far superior to any McDonald's in the US (the halal beef probably helps).","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-08T06:10:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"630288763688944","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"Why do people in our country in particular compare and expect the taste to be the same worldwide?

Their menu very interesting. Wife had the dry chicken chili, kids shared a chicken tikka, and I had the Thai red curry chicken. All entries were quite nice and excellent price. Our server Manzoor very nice and helpful guy. The place is small, I think maybe 4-5 tables. We like to go out early, so were lucky the place was empty at 8pm. Later, people started coming in quick. I heard there is a branch at Zamzama, so will try it there. Would love to try their chicken and mushroom and the other Chinese entries.

The formal SWOT RATING will be done after my 3rd visit. But my first impressions will be as follows.\n\nDisclaimer:- review on three places so will be a little long, but hopefully easy to follow.\n\nCAFEELA.\nGreat concept of combining all the popular cuisines in one menu and putting in a dine-in at one the posh locations in Zamzama. Great flavours, attentive service and very easy on the wallet. A must repeat soon - my fav items - starters mein sev poori, paani poori, brain masala crispy laal atae ki naan and a glass of lassi. \n\nKHANJI\nfantastic ambiance, one of the best locations on PORT GRAND. attentive and efficient staff - also very accommodating (they actually went got us an order from another place since we had a hard core aalu-eater wi us) and great food. The items I would recommend (on just my first trip) are the mutton boti and mutton ribs (we had numkeen and I look forward to the spicy ones next time) the chicken thu well made unfortunately never scores well with me unless exceptional. The elaichee chai was just amazing and will be even more fabulous when the weather gets colder.\n\nSATTAR BUKSH\ngreat location and was access. Funky decor and an interesting place that has the potential of becoming the favourite hangout for all those looking for a place with wifi and good chai/coffee/drinks. Since they are in their infancy days (not even weeks) I will over look the few glitches. The few things that were tried today and recommended were - the bhinnote bunkebab, the daam bun kebab, the daal chawal (but didnt like the shaami kebabs) the thyme chicken, and the lassi (hmmmm yes I kinda like that over milkshake and will order it anywhere I see it on the menu) I love the little paaparde (papadoms) they served with the bun kebabs and the  best green chutney I have had outside my house. \n\nAll in all I am looking forward to SWOTTING all these places again and soon. Will rate them once I have been at least 3 times to each","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-15T19:38:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T05:49:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715251102","name":"Sophia Nazeer"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"100003247463950","name":"Murk Mustafa"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"100002814495361","name":"Studioc UpCake"},{"id":"592090015","name":"Javeria Ahmed"},{"id":"100000675092971","name":"Fahim Farooq"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"574052713","name":"Harun Aziz"},{"id":"500778016","name":"Hammad Munir"},{"id":"100003303131853","name":"Samad Fansia"},{"id":"611294921","name":"Irum Chaudhry"},{"id":"1292953231","name":"Aakash Kumar"},{"id":"709724895","name":"Annie Abbasi"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"741205131","name":"Maleeha Ahmad Qureshi"},{"id":"1324057559","name":"Safi Ahmed"},{"id":"739231013","name":"Aiya Quli"},{"id":"719028214","name":"Rehmat Ebrahim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE5MDI4MjE0","before":"NzE1MjUxMTAy"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_619277281456759/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzE5MDI4MjE0"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619278494789971","from":{"name":"Mahrukh Abbasi","id":"519901828"},"message":"i enjoyed their tea menu:  cheeni rok ke, patti thok ke, and elaichi chai :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-15T19:40:59+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619279201456567","from":{"name":"Humera Jawed","id":"644820164"},"message":"But their tea is for 175 dunt u think so it's too over price dey r not sitting in any 5 star hotel dey should cut down deir prices","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-15T19:43:28+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619281048123049","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Humera Jawed as I said there were glitches.

Even the complimentary salad that come to the table within a minute of us settling down, was super fresh. Very generous staff and a calm and pleasant environment.

I love their muttons chops, bhindi and haandi the best! Went to the new Cafeela in Zamzama Lane 9, last night with an out of towner friend. Both of us had a cold and wanted something thai. We ordered some fried prawns and a hummus platter as starters which I have to be honest don't recall much since we were busy catching up on some gossip but tasted fine or else I would have definately remembered. My friend ordered the Thai baked fish and i played safe and ordered the Thai chicken in red curry. My friend liked his fish and I loved the curry! Servcie was very prompt and courteous.  We skipped dessert but was a relaxing and quiet dinner.

Its just amazing how Mr Big with Egg n Cheese is perfect every time . It feels like they have time frozen the entire process for the last 20 years . Succulent , Flavoursome , Juicy Satisfaction all wrapped up in One little Piece of Heaven. I'd rate it 12/10 , 2 extra points for that smile on my face every time I take the first bite.\n\n2- Al Asif Square : Though a bit risky for some fellows but to be honest the place was packed . We had food at MADINA RESTAURANT which is located inside Al Asif Square and to some people's surprise there were few families around there as well ( well to do families at that ) enjoying food , the atmosphere was friendly we were greeted as warmly as always . We had the famous Dumba Boti , Afghani Pulao , Namkeen Gosht and Karahi.  Now i don't want to waste time in describing the brilliance of food . \nThat is the best Authentic Afghani food out there, Period , 11/10 . One extra point for the Afghan brethren for their every gracious hospitality. \n\n3- Tayyabi Restaurant : Located in Hussainabad. It one of the few unsung heroes of Karachi. We ordered Prawn Masala , KataKat , Chicken Chargha Fry, Malai Boti and Tikkas . Food was served a bit late as they prepare all the dishes fresh and from the scratch. \nPrawn Masala is one of the best in town as the prawns just melt in your mouth and mix with that zesty masala . THE DAMN ! \n\nKatakat and Chicken Chargha fry are good too . All in all yet another place you wont come out unsatisfied or cheated, EVER . 8/10 . -2 for the stolen side mirror of my friend's car from the parking :P\n\n4-  The Burger Shack: I have Shake Shack every week so it did not impressed me much. But i'd like to commend the owner for doing the best damn possible thing by cloning a famous international franchise's menu and making it possible to offer taste in it as well. I was not disappointed to say the least. 7/10\n\n5- Cafeela : Simply put , Zahoor bhai you rock . Okra Jalfarezi , Malai Boti , Nathiya Gali Qeema , Shahi Tukray , Chicken Yakhni Pulao are all yum.

Earlier this week I went with friends twice to the actual Shabaz outlet to eat, plus ordered in loads of food for the whole family a couple of days later so ended up trying more variety than usual (feedback on dishes below) - and everyone I have introduced to Cafeela has been seriously impressed, and wondering how they haven't discovered it before. The Sizzling bhindi, which has always been delicious (and more importantly light and healthy - as most bhindi dishes in Pakistan are cooked heavy on the oil), was even more so when we actually had it fresh and crispy in the restaurant on the sizzling hot plate. The Paneer tikka which has recently been introduced to the menu (after I've been pestering them for nearly a year to add it, as I love it as a dish and knew Cafeela's chef would do it well), was soft and flavoursome. Palak Paneer was packed full of taste, and as ever very light on the oil, my friends were raving about the Moong masoor daal and Anda ghotala, though didn't much care for the Daal chana fry (too oily). The Fish barbq boti is great (although on that dish I will say the pieces could be bigger), and Papaya salad and Thai beef salad (the latter they will substitute paneer for the beef if you're vegetarian) was better than at the Thai restaurants I've tried. As for chicken and meat dishes, I can't review them as I don't eat meat apart from seafood, but my fam / friends who tried those dishes really enjoyed them.

I was told Ill get a call back in a few minutes. Then the guy from the outlet calls me up and starts to explain how their not late and the order was confirmed late etc etc. I read the time off their own slip (the one printed at the outlet at the time of delivery) which still showed the order was 45 mins late. Again the guy on the other end went into technicalities trying to give lame excuses. By this time I was really fed up. \nThen the guy just says \"aap ko nahi dayna tou nahi dain\" and shuts the phone.\nI really liked Dominos customer service and if they had just admitted their mistake and apologized I would have happily paid.

Any desert makers out there that wish to supply please get in touch with me on 03002020555 to discuss and arrange a meeting to go through what you have on offer.  All the deserts will not necessarily come from one source.  For example on the desi side we are going to put CAFEELA'S SHAHI TUKRA which is one of the best Shahi Tukra's I have had for a long long time...we intend to credit the desert supplier with the credit on the menu...so for example if we have Cafeela's Shahi Tukra ...then that is what it will be called on the menu.   We will not take credit for it....Why we wont make our own deserts? ..that is a question that has a simple answer...we will be a restaurant famous for its food and service....deserts are not our forte ...so we will let the professionals in that field provide our customers with the best that is available in town.  In time when we are ready to launch our own array of deserts and are convinced it is top class...we will do so...It is a principle we will adhere to stongly...let us provide the best deserts in town under one roof.  I believe we will be one of a few Restaurants that will have a desert trolly rolled out to the table for the customers to choose from.... Seafood and other main menu dishes of course will be our own and made to as perfect as we can get it in an open kitchen atmosphere....so anyone wishing to supply on a fresh daily basis ..please get in touch.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-06T18:10:23+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-15T04:31:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"685660006","name":"Muhammed Ali Rahim Najjad"},{"id":"654298693","name":"Huma Akhter Mundia"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"509700022","name":"Hiba Akmal"},{"id":"619452805","name":"Sabrina Saboor Jawad"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"617715399","name":"Uzma Javeri"},{"id":"777488661","name":"Zarnak Sidhwa"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzA4MDI1NDkx","before":"Njg1NjYwMDA2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"456984151019407","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Descriptive enough...good luck :-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-06T18:11:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"456986354352520","from":{"name":"Haroon Leghari","id":"100000059823691"},"message":"Doc would love u to participate in our decision making process on deserts...u have agreat sweet tooth with a good sense of what is the best out there...u could have a panel of friends to help in the process....suggestions are welcome","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-06T18:18:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"456991007685388","from":{"name":"Akbar Khan","id":"100000245074195"},"message":"Cafela shahi tukras are out of this world.. it brings back the old world charm too..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-06T18:32:59+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"457012267683262","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Haroon Leghari I have had the pleasure if sampling several dessert experts in town and many are home bakers, who would love the opportunity to be able to reach a market who have sampled their products and then place orders.
