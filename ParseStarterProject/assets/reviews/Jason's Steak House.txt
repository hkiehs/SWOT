Situated up above Pearl Continental Hotel, the place was no less than magnificent when we walked in. The subtle ambiance, the pre-50's music playing, the extra-courteous waiters, I had a feeling it was going to be one amazing dinner. I had ordered the Chicken Dijon Steak and my friend ordered the Lobster Tail. After approximately twenty minutes of waiting, we had our food served to us. I can describe the food in one work, HORRIBLE! When a place is charging more than RS. 1000 per steak, one would obviously expect it to be amazing, but it was the worst steak I've had in the city. And don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind paying extra money if the food is worth it, sadly this wasn't even close. I would go as far as saying Arizona Grill serves better steaks than this place. It's terribly overpriced for the horrible food they serve. The portions were extra-small, and the steak tasted like something that would be made at home. I rank this high-class restaurant, not classy enough to go to.
