So I guess we deserve this poison to be shoved down our throats. \n\nBut at least can they pretend to make an attempt to make it edible.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-12T02:18:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-13T17:53:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"594796590","name":"Ufaq Ashfaque"},{"id":"692511440","name":"Naila Wasti"},{"id":"571952596","name":"Shaarmeen Chughtai"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"644815164","name":"Ahsan Pervez"},{"id":"100002054881531","name":"Aamir Khan"},{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"574052713","name":"Harun Aziz"},{"id":"692390995","name":"Wahaj M Khan"},{"id":"100001434743152","name":"Raza Rehmani"},{"id":"698764443","name":"Shahnawaz Moti"},{"id":"745945065","name":"Shahjehan Maniar"},{"id":"100001829144476","name":"Faisal Noor"},{"id":"100003216046346","name":"Shezi Memon"},{"id":"549655574","name":"Nazish Huda"},{"id":"100003299348370","name":"Asad Memon"},{"id":"589563741","name":"M Junaid Chinoy"},{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"100002316753027","name":"Yas Minz"},{"id":"500778016","name":"Hammad Munir"},{"id":"549320513","name":"Momina Akber Rahim"},{"id":"734678626","name":"Rubaya Zia Khan"},{"id":"734228975","name":"Rizwan Mustafa Yusuf"},{"id":"769030393","name":"Muhammad Danniyal Jafri"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzY5MDMwMzkz","before":"NTk0Nzk2NTkw"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_632371256814028/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzY5MDMwMzkz"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"632410236810130","from":{"name":"Nadira Saeed","id":"620103062"},"message":"Personally I fail to understand what the excitement is all about anyway ?!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-12T02:41:04+0000","like_count":9,"user_likes":false},{"id":"632428826808271","from":{"name":"Talha Shahid","id":"668642026"},"message":"Too good !

A quaint little place tucked away in Khadda Market.  Called up a few minutes in advance for a table of 3, and the management was courteous enough to have a table ready. \n\nThe place has really nice ambiance, is tastefully done, plays good contemporary music, and has adequate lighting.  Just the perfect place for a quick casual meal.\n\nOrdered the Flame Grilled Chicken, and that was bloody delicious.  It ensured that the chicken's sacrifice was not in vain.  The chicken was super flavorful, and every little square inch of the chicken had its own distinct flavor.  The chicken was juicy, and it never went dry.  The meal certainly did justice to its nomenclature.  The chicken was served with assortments that complemented the meal, and a fresh, soft, and fluffy pita.\n\nAlso ordered the Lightweight Chicken Shawarma, and that seemed to be a disaster.  The chicken was bland, dry, and tasteless.  The only saving grace was the pita, and hummus.  I would personally avoid the Shawarma next time around.  \n\nDefinitely becoming a regular at Rowtisserie for its Flame Grilled Chicken.  Hoping that they row across the Mediterranean, introduce Gyros, and just nail the flavor!\n\nRow all the way.\n\nOverall Rating -- 7/10 (mainly because of the Flame Grilled Chicken)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-22T20:27:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-24T16:30:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"724148371","name":"Rabia Hai"},{"id":"1590802896","name":"Farri Khalid"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"},{"id":"100006519972294","name":"Ali Raza Q"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"797675206","name":"Javeria Usmani"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Before i proceed to the detailed version, a precise overview.\nPathetic food, pathetic customer services, pathetic attitude and rude behavior - Yes That is how it was.\nMy friend reached there around 6:25pm as 'instructed' by the Hardees ppl since they were not taking any reservations. As he entered, he called a guy to ask if there is any other table free then the one they were standing at. The guy looked at him, came near the table and then walked away to a distance and totally ignored him. However, we reached in a while and took the seats. Placed the order and in few minutes, there were burgers roaming around here and there and i was like 'Why so early?' - the burgers would be doomed by iftar as they would get cold and then to my utmost surprise - the burgers were on our table by 7:07pm which was 13 minutes before the Iftar and we were like :o - and as expected the burgers were weird by the time of iftar and so were the fries. I am not sure about others but my burger patty was undercooked as well or it seemed so after being lying there for a good time. The only thing which remained good was the onion rings. After we were somehow done with our burgers - were deciding to fill out the comment card, we asked for a fan from a service guy who said he is bringing in a while and never showed up :D and after sometime when a guy came to take stuff from our table, we asked him \"Pen milsakta hai\", he just slightly nodded his head and ignored the question which was asked again and left. My friend then walked up to the person looking after the floor to get the pen to fill out the comment card.\nEnd of the day, if it was not the company - at least i would have been doomed.
