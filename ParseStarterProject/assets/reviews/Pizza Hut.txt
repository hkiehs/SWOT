A lil Pizza with four choices of toppings. They offer wedges or a couple of Garlic breads. Not the supreme ones. No cheese. So kinda meh. And a drink. \n\nIll cut to the chase. Whattay Pizza!! \n\nCheesy, loaded with thick gooey rich sauce and near perfect fluffy crust with that crunch on the outer bits. The toppings were jus okay and not so evenly spread, but that meant more bites of that rich tomato sauce hidden under that thick cheese. Hell, skip the toppings n gimme a Margherita n Im a happy man!\n\nThis was fantastic.

It need not be a fine dining place..\n\nOver the last 2+ years all I have seen in Karachi are different trends.. One person dares challenge Pizza Hut with a new very different offering and it becomes a hit among us 'the foodies'.. Next few weeks we see the numerous pizza places open up.. some are good some are OK but after a few weeks they all taste the same.. Then came the thin crust era (No offence to anyone I totally love Domino's Thin Crust pizza)  and everyone from Domino's and bakeries and cafe selling the thin crust..\n\nWhile everyone was enjoying the 20 inches pizza, Hardees came to town.. There again began this trend of selling burgers.. And its still ongoing..Everyday there is a new place advertising themselves..\n\nIs there any place in Karachi that offers something other than burgers and pizza and pasta which tastes good too... I don't mind having sea food or steaks (No Arizona or Roasters pls) but something that would just end this monotony in the food choices we have (or rather I have) in this city..\n\nI know some of you would say there is BOTS ( Love the food there), Ghaffar, Log Inn Lounge(Chapli Kebabs are awesome) and so on.. But really need some innovation something new and that can actually get someone hooked on to the place.. \n\nA few years ago there was this little cafe at Karsaz called Alao.. It used to have a great sandwich and very very good cold coffee.. It was a very quiet place yet I have not been able to find the same taste since it closed down..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-13T19:55:12+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-14T07:32:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002623239897","name":"Ezzy Irfan Izhar"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE2NTgyNjY2","before":"MTAwMDAyNjIzMjM5ODk3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"649509475100206","from":{"name":"Vishal Preetam","id":"1781512632"},"message":"burns road (Y)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-13T20:35:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"649513738433113","from":{"name":"Ammar Habib Khan","id":"685505866"},"message":"Rowtisserie.

Dinner at Olivetto after a long hiatus, and I doubt I'll be going back again.  The place has a formal ambiance, with Eminem talking about someone's mother, and some guys rapping about flying high like a Gulfstream.  The music being played was a disaster, and the place rivaled McDonalds and Burger King in playing the most retarded music.  \n\nThe bread served with Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar was fresh, and reminded me of the standard starters served on the Mediterranean coast.  Wouldn't mind having a more generous serving of Olive Oil, as what was served was barely sufficient for one person.\n\nOrdered the Arabic Platter, Meaty Lasagne, and Chicken Florentine for main course.  The Arabic Platter was brilliant, the lamb was moist, succulent, and juicy -- while the beef was cooked to perfection.  The pita was fresh, and the serving of Hummus was generous.  \n\nThe lasagne was a disaster -- it lacked texture, and the taste was just off.  Pizza Hut served a better lasagne once upon a time.  The Chicken Florentine was decent, but can't figure the nomenclature when it lacked the primary ingredient, i.e. spinach.   Also ordered Chocolate Molten Lava - it was grainy, and better offerings are served by other eateries.\n\nThe place levies a service charge, which basically means the patron pays a component of staff salaries, which is supposed to be built in the prices on the menu.  Soon enough, they may also start charging Generator Charges, Gas Charges, etc.  \n\nAs a policy, I don't like to go to places which have 'service charges' in place -- so I guess, I will be avoiding Olivetto for good.  If (almost) European prices are being paid in Karachi, and there is nothing special about the food -- a place is better off being avoided.\n\nOverall Rating -- 6/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-02T21:07:14+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-03T15:14:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1360134242","name":"Fahima Mubashir"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"},{"id":"1031220895","name":"M Saquib Khwaja"},{"id":"1086930427","name":"Ali Saif Memon"},{"id":"776525430","name":"Khadija Tahir"},{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"1198610816","name":"Maheen Siddiqui"},{"id":"746376004","name":"Sameen Shahid"},{"id":"851275369","name":"Belinda Fonseca"},{"id":"100001185864732","name":"Faryal Noman"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1247552277","name":"Abdullah Farooq"},{"id":"844625322","name":"Goher Zaman"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Plus they were toasted more than they were supposed to just to cover up the staleness.. Next! The meat patty was nowhere close to WHAT a BK Whopper should be, it was dry, bland, tasteless and didnt have the right sauces! Onions were over dressed! And ultmately, there were no standard cups for soft drinks.. For the same order some of us got small n the rest medium.. Plus I wonder why the were serving pepsi instead of coke! It has been a horrible exprience and very disappointed about the lack of quality to such heights! Cant imagine myself having it again anytime soon.. Might try it once the full menu is introduced..

Plus they were toasted more than they were supposed to just to cover up the staleness.. Next! The meat patty was nowhere close to WHAT a BK Whopper should be, it was dry, bland, tasteless and didnt have the right sauces! Onions were over dressed! And ultmately, there were no standard cups for soft drinks.. For the same order some of us got small n the rest medium.. Plus I wonder why the were serving pepsi instead of coke! It has been a horrible exprience and very disappointed about the lack of quality to such heights! Cant imagine myself having it again anytime soon.. Might try it once the full menu is introduced.. Mushroom Swiss to be specific.. It will be a deal breaker! In the end..

Hardees and burger shack are in a different league of greasy burgers so comparing BS with Hardees seems more appropriate. Thirdly get your arrogance and pessimism off your heads.

It was home to a culinary delight of mythical proportions, called The Whopper. As time passed and consumerism ruled, places similar to Burger King started their slow but deliberate invasion of our fine country. However, as they came one after another, Burger King remained elusive. And as with all things elusive, they more it played hard to get, the more we craved it. When we travelled abroad, we would have BK at every available opportunity - in some cases, people even went to extreme lengths like buying it from the DXB airport (where it was conveniently located near gate 210, where the morning Karachi flight invariably was) so that it could be brought back and enjoyed with the family. \n\nAnd then one day, there was an ad in a newspaper, advertising jobs at? gasp? Burger King Pakistan! It has been a journey of epic anticipation, waiting (thankfully not with baited breath) until today, when I lined up with many others in the glaring sun outside BK Nishat to have my ever favourite - the Double Whopper. The queue moved relatively fast and in about 30 minutes, I was in. Another 20 minutes and I was at the counter, where I found out, to my utter dismay, that there is no Double Whopper. A minor misstep, I thought, and promptly ordered three Whopper meals and two Chicken Royale meals. There was some confusion about whether fries are being served to customers or not, as there was a shortage and perhaps fries were only being provided to customers who had placed their orders well before mine. But that was quickly sorted and I was assured that five lovely packets of fries would accompany the burgers. There was a wait of 15-20 minutes for the food to be served, although it felt like eternity. And then, suddenly, there it was: a Whopper, in front of me, in Pakistan. Fast forward twenty minutes and there you have wrappers on the trays, empty Pepsi glasses and fry packets. The fries, by the way, are absolutely mind-glowingly good. Its hard to believe they're from a fast food outlet. The burgers? are a slightly different, more complicated story. They were good, but as we left, I couldn't help but think that the whole experience was somewhat underwhelming. So I really thought about it - yes, it wasn't a Double Whopper which is what I always have, but that wasn't it. And its not as though the burgers were bad: they're just like BK everywhere else. The size is good, its a nice filling meal without making you feel stuffed. Even the Pepsi was really good :) But the problem is this: when I first visited Burger Shack, I couldn't wait to go back. And sadly, I don't feel the same way about BK. In fact, I'm not really feeling the need to go back. And I think the reason is this: we've been spoiled by offerings like Burger Shack. The advent of the gourmet burger into our lives means that as good as the Whopper is, its just not good enough. I know I'm not alone in comparing Burger King to Burger Shack - at least four people in BK were doing the same thing. \n\nIn conclusion: Burger King is, or rather, the Whopper, Angus and Chicken Royale are just like their foreign counterparts. I'm sure that the others, including the Swiss and Mushroom will be just as good, whenever they are launched. The onion rings too, when they become available, should be good. They're having a lot of management related issues right now and the staff is clearly under-trained, but that will be fixed over time. You can go to BK and know that you'll get the same taste you get everywhere else - just don't go expecting BK to blow the local offerings out of the water. Because, as I'm unbelievably proud to say, the local offerings are better. Which reminds me, I haven't had Burger Shack in a while...","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-06T12:20:33+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-07T12:06:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"569196654","name":"Maria Sultan"},{"id":"786471893","name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed"},{"id":"648091964","name":"Saba Sadia"},{"id":"732705760","name":"Nishat Aleem Khan"},{"id":"752174107","name":"Urooj Imran"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1371113498","name":"Danyal Sopariwala"},{"id":"571881277","name":"Sna Nm"},{"id":"565157664","name":"Sarah Farooq"},{"id":"100000223684855","name":"Sana A.

Cant emphasize enough on how important this is! Dominos nailed it. It had cheese. Sahe wali cheeeeeeeeeeeseee!\n\nCrust was proper. Not bun like. Not roti like. The corn dusting on the bottom gave it some ... Umm ...well, made it seem less like roti. A bit too greasy though for my liking, still bettet than others.\n\nIt could have used a bit more pepperoni to be honest.\n\nAnd I must praise sauce. A simple tomato sauce ... Not loaded with spices or anything. Simple rich tomatoey goodness. The way it should be on a Pizza.\n\nTo sum it up. A good crust, with a rich tomatoey sauce on top, fair bit of pepperoni topped with a good bit of cheese. Proper pizza. \n\nAnd at 400rs it was a better deal than a slice from 14th Street at Rs. 350. Dominos has 350rs Pizzas too with different toppings so on par with price, more filling and in another league on taste. \n\nAnd yes, 30 mins on the dot.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-10-02T06:20:53+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-02T15:01:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001772445260","name":"Zamzam Shah"},{"id":"511168242","name":"Akber Ali Khaliqdina"},{"id":"816865264","name":"Muhammad Arsalan Siddiqui"},{"id":"538467790","name":"????? ???"},{"id":"649725153","name":"Ateeb Akber"},{"id":"515752460","name":"Fizza Farooqui"},{"id":"100001259041364","name":"Foziya Mobeen"},{"id":"771610318","name":"Muhammad Mohsin Javed"},{"id":"723005353","name":"Ahsan Bham"},{"id":"851695334","name":"Narmeen Hassan"},{"id":"100004078952313","name":"Shazia Asghar"},{"id":"614947148","name":"Muhammad Adnan"},{"id":"556365091","name":"Fabian Pereira"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"652430244","name":"Afira Faisal"},{"id":"643410964","name":"Xera HusaYn"},{"id":"691820617","name":"Rija Aitzaz Qureshi"},{"id":"510349226","name":"Talha Idrees"},{"id":"526489659","name":"Sohail Abbas"},{"id":"592434771","name":"Ahmad Chapsi"},{"id":"635870206","name":"Faisal Ijaz"},{"id":"531280225","name":"Rabia Jehan"},{"id":"1419404438","name":"Muhammad Ahsan"},{"id":"1815166822","name":"Shenny Rehman"},{"id":"513232132","name":"Nazia Latif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEzMjMyMTMy","before":"MTAwMDAxNzcyNDQ1MjYw"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_627420510642436/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTEzMjMyMTMy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"627428953974925","from":{"name":"Noreen Ahmed","id":"541880374"},"message":"have to agree to this. dominos has majorly upped their game man! someone give Dominos a crunchy calzone for this!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-02T07:00:45+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false},{"id":"627430380641449","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Wah wah!

Fortnightly Pizzo indulgence at Chai Dhaba.  The best thing about Pizzo is that it can deliver Pizza in a timely manner at the most random places.\n\nOrdered the Pepperoni Pizza, and like always it was excellent.  Just the right amount of Cheese and Pepperoni, with a firm crust.  No one does a better Deep Pan Pepperoni than Pizzo.\n\nFor experimental purposes, also ordered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, and that was a major disaster.  The pizza was loaded with all sort of assortments, putting Pizza Hut to shame.  The guy taking the order said it will be spicy -- but I never thought spicy meant dumping half a bottle of tabasco sauce on the pizza.  There was just too much happening on the pizza, and the tabasco was overpowering.\n\nBeing a loyal Pizzo customer, the best combination to order from Pizzo is Pepperoni & Margherita.  Buffalo Chicken should be strictly avoided!\n\nOverall Rating (for this meal) -- 5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-16T11:04:02+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T12:53:25+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1668177824","name":"Omer Salimullah"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzMyOTE3OTY4","before":"MTY2ODE3NzgyNA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619702711414216","from":{"name":"Nasim Ahmad","id":"1343979604"},"message":"It's incredible how many pizzerias have opened in the past year and every one seems to have its fans.

Stopped by for a quick lunch, and was expecting some inventive cuisine.  The ambiance was comforting, and the service was smooth.\n\nOrdered Spaghetti with Meatballs, and a Gouda Burger.

A good option  for having  Spaghetti with Meatballs in the city, if one can't cook better stuff at home.\n\nGouda Burger had a disastrous bun-patty ratio.  The fries were soggy, as well as the bottom of the bun.  The burger didn't really deserve a price tag of PKR690 -- much better burgers are available at a lower price.  It is supposed to be a gourmet burger, but there was absolutely nothing gourmet about it.\n\nThe prices are steep, and I couldn't really see the value for money there.  With Sweet Potato Fries at PKR490, they were probably one of the most expensive Sweet Potato fries I've ever seen anywhere in the world.

I make my own pizzas at home for years (and they are top of the line Mashallah) and seldom eat pizza from outside. So I'm usually harsh on commercial pizza eateries (especially our good friend, Pizza Hut...) But I have nothing but praise for Pizza Point. Incredibly good pizza and excellent value for money. Crust is the first thing I look at in quality pizza and theirs very light, chewy and just right. Have always been a beef eater and never had chicken in pizza till now. Had their chicken fajita pizza and it was excellent. I give them 9/10. Haroon was our server. He took his time but in the end gave us a top product. Will definitely go again.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-30T18:08:50+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-01T12:27:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1359766063","name":"Faaz Shabbir"},{"id":"814700331","name":"Faraz Fahim"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"682446717","name":"Amna Tauqeer"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"551195654","name":"Ali Daud"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"524804365","name":"Mj Salman"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI1OTY4OTUz","before":"MTM1OTc2NjA2Mw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"611844165533404","from":{"name":"Naeem Allawala","id":"1041287827"},"message":"Try California Pizza","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-30T18:57:06+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"611905138860640","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"And Broadway","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-30T22:23:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"612015692182918","from":{"name":"Nasim Ahmad","id":"1343979604"},"message":"I heard good things about California Pizza, will try it out.

Easily enough, an amazing experience. The manager there is one of the most friendly people that I've come across, and at a time when everybody's having their iftaar and eating about, he was polite enough to keep his food on hold and serve us instead. The guy there, Winston was extremely polite and welcoming too, and was quick with the suggestions. In the end, we went for the 'All you can eat' deal, and I have to say, the pizzas there are some of the best that Karachi has to offer. I'm sure the restaurant started out as a direct rival to Pizza Hut, but it has far surpassed them in terms of quality and service. The pizzas were served piping hot right on time, and Winston was even nice enough to get me a salad of his own accord. Their Chicken Tikka, Sicilian Chicken and Fajita are easily the best flavors that you can get anywhere in Karachi. Extremely polite, prompt and to top it all off, the food was absolutely amazing. It's good to see the manager himself taking an interest and asking if everything was okay. More eateries need to focus on customer management and relations, and I was pleasantly surprised that Pizza One pays attention to such fine details. All in all, an amazing experience, and for me, this year's biggest surprise and a must try goes to Pizza One. I've become a total fan of the food and the place itself, and I'd recommend it to anybody whose looking for some real good food and friendly service. For those who are looking for some idea of their taste: Pizza Hut pales in comparison, and yes they are better than 14th Street Pizza.

He returned 20 min later with same pizzas, this time over cooked. We were starving by then but still we refused to accept it. But when I hinted that the servers were becoming a little cranky, I asked for the manager pretty harshly. He came out in no time and when we explained him the whole story he told us actually it's the result of new ovens they have got which are supposed to cook pizzas early. I told him to get me those traditional ones with normal cooking temperatures because I will never accept uncooked half baked dough in the name of pizza. 30 min later we got fresh yummy pizza perfectly cooked.

But, everyone needs to understand that operating a kitchen in this country is very different from operating them else where. One reason being that Pakistan is invested with more bugs than usual in every corner, especially flying insects. This is because our country is sadly very dirty and not maintained at a level of healthy standards. Is bug may have flew in during the time of adding the cheese or it may have been stuck to a certain topping. Due to the level of chaos in a kitchen, especially during the evening may have caused this mishap to happen. People cannot blame food chains for such unwanted incidents. They don't exist to feed you bugs or cold food or give you your food late, they are there because they would like to share a taste of something which they have mastered or developed. They put in a lot of effort to provide this taste to you. Some get it right, some get it just okay, and sometimes even the best of taste providers face a problem (such as this), which they really did not intend facing.

Told me that my pizza and garlic bread would take 15 mins. When I went back, some lady was yelling at them about having waited an hour for her pizza ... to which the response was \"actually we have some new people working so things are not going well right now\". If that didnt scare me, my pizza arrived and was placed at the other end of a long counter while the poor kid who took my order went back to get my two orders of garlic bread supreme rather than the two pieces of garlic bread that had been given to him. During that wait, I sadly did not pay attention ... and a brainiac at the register gave that pizza away to someone else. When my garlic bread arrived, the poor kid helping me went looking for my cheese lover's pizza... which of course was not to be found. Within two minutes, another irate lady came back with bites out of my cheese pizza wondering why her chicken pizza had no chicken on it!! After watching this three stooges routine, and being asked to wait another 10-15 minutes for a replacement ... I \"politely\" (haha) declined and rather strongly asked for an immediate refund... which was given. Before I left, I suggested the manager think about hiring and training competent staff members who do not get overwhelmed when three people order at Pizza Hut.

We went to try Burger Shack last night at 9 ish with my younger sisters.. I was a bit taken back by the self service idea idea n being made to stand on the roadside n wait while all the cars passing by us n creepy people stare at us..( i m very protective abt my sisters n probably thats i was loathing this idea even more ;/)               i didnt understand the logic of wasting so much space inside the shop when they could easily accomodate us inside. \n                                                                                                                             Living in Karachi has us spoiled us i guess and if we eat at a road side joint we are used to of being brought a menu by a waiter, who takes our order n we eat in peace............ON top of that we were told that Burger Shack was out of beef ???Hello!! ?? People were standing are screaming at the cashiers at the confusion abt their orders...one of the guys stepped forward and asked them what was the weight of the patty n the cashier told him he didnt know...:0!!!\n\n We were there n very  hungry so we still ordered Chicken Crunch,Chicken Jalepeno crunch and Honey Mustard crunch combos n asked our driver to stand near the window to collect our order. The order arrived and we left,but on our way home we realised the pack had NO fries, NO sauces,NO napkins Nor drinks.??? \u003d0!!! We went back all the way to collect it. The burgers were not bad but i dont understand their careless attitude n customer service. The idea of self service is alright but there were no guards around nor any proper space to wait..\n\nProbably will try more from them, once they start home delivery.

I personally loved, loved, loved it! My dad however, is old school with the same old Pizza Hut craving. Sigh. First of all, the way everything arrived. Piping hot, within thirty minutes, and smelling delicious! The sauce the chicken wings came in were spot on, and reminded me quite a bit of Upper Crust's Tex-mex sauce. Believe me, that's NOT a bad thing. Two places which make my kinda sauce? Yes, please! My sister devoured at least 4 of the 6 which I'd ordered. Moving on to the pizza itself. I requested the red jalapenos along with the onions and green chili topping, and it was the red jalapeno which made the pizza come alive. Personally, I would have preferred more marinara sauce on the base, since the flavor of the sauce itself wasn't coming through. Other than that, it was light, definitely thin crust and a joy to eat. The cinnabread was nice too, and I really enjoyed the crunchy demerara, cinnamony topping. I just wish the bread itself hadn't been just plain bread. A bit of the topping infused with the bread itself will definitely make me come back to it again and again. Overall though, it was a brilliant experience, and I'll definitely be ordering from Pizzo again!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-12T18:08:31+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-12T18:40:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"544811222","name":"Tehniat Aftab"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"558530146","name":"Fariha Nadir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTU4NTMwMTQ2","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"423500274367795","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Hallelujah!

Adjustments can be made easily if so much space is not needed. And rent is also negotiable and will be decided according to space requirements.

They are not consistent in their quality and some days it may be good and others really crap.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T09:09:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393421314042358","from":{"name":"Syed Aamir Bukhari","id":"1473431885"},"message":"Agree to her as  Hotel Indus,Royal Taj's quality of food varies drastically.Fast food chains would be safe bet.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T09:12:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393423307375492","from":{"name":"Saifullah Mazhar","id":"517287393"},"message":"so no speciality of hyderabad. any ways thanks","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T09:22:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393423470708809","from":{"name":"Saifullah Mazhar","id":"517287393"},"message":"excepth Bombay Bakery","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T09:23:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393424460708710","from":{"name":"Aruna Sujanani","id":"691887360"},"message":"Hyderabad is also known for Haji Rabri","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T09:28:06+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393433694041120","from":{"name":"Ratan Salem","id":"681799779"},"message":"Mirchi has opened a branch in Hyderabad but ofc not quite appropriate for lunch .","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-06T10:04:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393436284040861","from":{"name":"Sahar Iqbal","id":"509422944"},"message":"Aruna Sujanani Haji Rabri has opened in Khi too.

Have also left out Aylanto and Fuchsia that used to be on my favorites list for a long time because of late their quality has deteriorated. So here's the list in my order of preference: \n1. Xanders\n2. Sakura\n3. Okra\n4. Flo\n5. Biryani Of The Seas (BOTS)\n6. Cafe Blue Ginger (CBG)\n7. Olivetto\n8. Bundu Khan\n9. Deli\n10.

Enjoy!\n\nToday was my first time attending a blogger's meet at the soon-to-open Bella Vita. So exciting! Located right next to the Pizza Hut lane at Zamzama, this outlet is difficult to miss with its massive awning. Even with my lack of direction sense, I managed to make it without any difficulty at all. Upon entering, I had to silently admit to myself that this was one prettily dressed up place. It gave a very warm, welcoming vibe, where you can just imagine sitting yourself at a corner table in the comfy chair large enough to fit two people (At least for me) for as long as you wish to, with a cup of your favorite coffee and a good book. There was wooden paneling, tasteful painting interspersed along the walls, and amidst all the masculine brown paneling, femininely attired chandeliers hung at various intervals from the wooden ceiling. There was enough seating to accommodate a party of six or a table for two, interspersed with an assortment of comfortable looking lounging-type chairs, and the regular wooden chairs. \n\nUpon meeting the owners, I could see that the welcoming and comfortable atmosphere of Bella Vita was a reflection of their personalities. More than willing to please, they were easy to talk to and eager to note my novice opinions on their establishment. I also met Zehra here for the first time, which was a lovely experience. I learnt from her the art of taste-testing gelato. I digress however, and will come back to that in a bit. We were told that currently the menu was completely devoted to desserts and beverages, but they are planning on expanding the menu with other items in the future. We were also told that all their ingredients are imported from Italy, and fresh berries are imported every other day from Dubai, the assortment depending on the availability. The strawberries were massive, and the blueberries tasted just as they should. Sweet and juicy little morsels, fresh as you could hope for. They had 17 choices of gelato to choose from, including sugar-free vanilla and chocolate. Let me tell you, I was stumped. I wanted to try all of them, but nightmares of what it would do to my waistline held me back. Zehra however, was my inspiration for the taste-testing method. A teaspoon of each flavor was placed around a plate, and a glass of water to cleanse the palate was provided. Then began the taste-testing. The flavors that really, really made a home in my heart have to be After Eight, Lemon Sorbet, Chocolate, Caramel, and Chocolate Orange. And here's some massively stupendous news for those of you who say no to sugar. Are you ready to hear it? The sugar-free chocolate and vanilla tasted exactly the same as the regular chocolate and vanilla. I know, right? It's crazy. You have to go try it out for yourselves.\n\nNow, as for the menu, I didn't really thoroughly study it, but I did manage to find out that the regular size for the gelato serving is 60 grams, and price is Rs. 140. Along with the gelato, everything else on the menu also seemed to be extremely reasonably priced for the quality of the desserts being served and the ambiance. Free wi-fi too! \n\nAll in all, today's visit was a pleasure, and I can't wait to visit again. Best of luck, and keep it up, team Bella Vita!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-17T19:04:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-18T11:35:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"200900469","name":"Hassan Ashfaq"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"1079332060","name":"Farheen Omer"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"508350324","name":"Fatima Sattar Chawla"},{"id":"685460614","name":"Nida Sattar-Saad"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"MjAwOTAwNDY5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"381150678602755","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Paintings*","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T19:06:52+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"381265508591272","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Another novella!!!!!

It was an absolute delight to meet you, and it wouldn't have been as much fun if you hadn't been there. Looking forward to more meeting uppings with you.\nAdnaan, you've been my virtual SWOT buddy for a while now. An actual meetup is definitely due. Small cute chick is what people mostly think of me...till I lose my temper. That title will be discussed in person. Lol.\nSaira, I got my invitation 2 days before the event. It sucks that you couldn't make it.\nMr. Joe, thank you for your gracious comments. I tend to focus more on writing and letting the readers imagination do the illustration work.
