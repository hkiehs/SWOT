For the past 2 years I am residing in Karachi and my hunt for best Nihari is still not over. I have tried Zahid Nihari, Javed Nihari, Nihari Inn, Delhi Muslim, Delhi Sohail, Waheed and Ghaffar in Bahadurabad. So far I have not found the original \"Bong\" in Karachi but as far as Nihari is concerned, Delhi Ghaffar beats every Nihari restaurant in Karachi (I know most of the people wont agree with me on this). But if I talk about my overall Nihari experience, Waris Nihari in Lahore is simply unbeatable. I still have to try Sabri Nihari in Saddar and I have high hopes from it. Please suggest places where I can find the best Nihari or are there any restaurants who serve \"Bong\"?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-21T21:05:35+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-23T02:13:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501737785","name":"Aamir Dhedhi"},{"id":"723835542","name":"Fariha Aamir Khan"},{"id":"100001822097920","name":"Sara Kazmi"},{"id":"1049298397","name":"Sadiya Naveed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA0OTI5ODM5Nw\u003d\u003d","before":"NTAxNzM3Nzg1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"589845391066615","from":{"name":"Nadia Nadeem","id":"100000087144502"},"message":"Sabri saddar is the best","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-21T21:08:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"589846077733213","from":{"name":"Syed Wamiq Haider","id":"514714415"},"message":"Its Sabri Nihari, tell me when are we going..

Everything is sheer perfection. \n\n2. Koel Caf? ? When in doubt, just land your tushie at Koel and you will always enjoy phenomenal food, lovely ambience and very courteous service \u003c3\n\n3. BOTS ? again, no need to go into details, for obvious reasons, lol! Delicious food, great delivery service and an absolutely delightful host.\n\n4. Log Inn Lounge ? serves one of the best burgers in town, service is fabulous and the host is a wonderful person. Which is an added bonus for the place that is already doing so well on its food :)\n\nThese are my top 4. Rest of the 6 are fabulous places but I?m only going to list them as I don?t really want to rate them on the top 10 in any particular order. They are all wonderful places that serve great food with impeccable service.\n\n? Olivetto ? love the ambience, love the food even more.\n\n? Grilled Chilliz ? delicious food and great value for money.\n\n? Snack Attack ? a gem not known to many people on this group, in bahadurabad area. They make the best mushroom burgers in town! \n\n? Pizzo ? reviving the concept of great pizzas delivered at home. After the great fiasco that pizza hut has been for many years and domino?s being a huge disappointment, pizzo is like a breath of fresh air.\n\n? Golden Dragon Chinese ? don?t need to say much for them. I think this would be enough: I?ve never been a fan of Chinese food. But GD has totally won me over! \u003c3\n\n? Zahid Nihari, Tariq Road ? deeeeliisshh!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-17T17:16:15+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-19T06:34:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100003034652779","name":"Saher Mukhtar"},{"id":"543405800","name":"Tahir Wahid"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"708482342","name":"Saba Basit"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzA4NDgyMzQy","before":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"399454210105735","from":{"name":"Bilal Alvi","id":"641495625"},"message":"a special mention for Gun Smoke.... the new one is better than the old one \u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T17:17:16+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399463893438100","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"have you tried gbc ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T17:39:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399464043438085","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"and saba do you have a facebook page ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T17:40:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399471693437320","from":{"name":"Mohammad Bin Zia","id":"1137915284"},"message":"Gauher Hashim Please check your inbox.
