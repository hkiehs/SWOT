We were 5 friends and since the place is \"known\" for its steaks we all ordered it. I ordered Arizona Fire Steak which by name seemed Arizonas specialty, when my order arrived, which was in due time and served in correct temperature, it was the opposite of what I expected. By \"fire\" I thought it would be something hot, saucy, spicy but when platter was placed in front of me I wasn't sure I was at Arizona. The presentation was zero, it looked like a piece of dry meat placed in a platter with mashed potatoes to go with it, which looked liked uncooked pizza dough, and few boiled vegetables on the other side. Too unprofessional. Anyways I started to eat still hopeful that it might not taste the way it looks, but that was disappointment too. The taste wasn't that bad but nothing extraordinary. The mashed potatoes were too salty, out of all the things on it i liked the boiled vegetables :P. Then we ordered dessert which was Chocolate Silk Pie. It arrived with same, unappetizing presentation. The taste was good but there was nothing silky! Infact the bottom layer was so hard that I might have to stand up on it to break it. \nSo my experience at Arizona was really bad. after paying such a big amount I still left with half stomach empty. The staff was good and co-operative. Good service. But who goes to restaurant for the good service only?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-13T18:21:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-14T01:48:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001882596023","name":"Mansoor Zaheer"},{"id":"673197577","name":"Syed Talha Khurshid"},{"id":"559881298","name":"Nadia Mahasin"},{"id":"100001420487264","name":"Saqib M Ibrahim"},{"id":"651245042","name":"Falak Zahid Sheikha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjUxMjQ1MDQy","before":"MTAwMDAxODgyNTk2MDIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"602689159782238","from":{"name":"Faryal Naqvi","id":"739670623"},"message":"sadly arizona has really detoriated over time","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T18:25:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602691326448688","from":{"name":"Xaraa Aar Kay","id":"100001611544621"},"message":"the last time i went to Arizona.. it was Awesome!\ni went to Arizona at Atrium Mall...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T18:31:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602691796448641","from":{"name":"Sarah J.

I, along with a colleague went there for the reservations and woahh the management over there was very much concerned about the \"10% Service Charges\" as they kept on mentioning that I will have to pay 10% service charges on the bill since we are 15 people. I had no issues on service charges but did not like the way they kept on mentioning it so I had to say k \"Bhai Mil Jayein Gay Apko Don't worry\". Anyways, we went there at 6:00pm in the evening, ordered the food out of which 6 were steaks including Pepper Steak, 2 Arizona Fire Steak, Twin Steak, American something steak. Food was delivered \"Kiston Mein\" after 40 minutes. To our disappointment, all the steaks were served COLD and also they served Mexican Steak in Chicken instead of one Arizona Fire Steak. Had to return all the steaks and waited another 10 minutes for them to come back with the correct order. 4 Order were returned correctly but for the rest of 2 steaks (One of it was mine :() the waiter said that chef will have to make new steaks since they were medium rare and cant be cooked further so we will have to wait for another 20 to 25 minutes. This was the last nail in the coffin. I asked them to cancel my order and told them that you guys should not ask for service charges when you cant entertain your customers properly. You brought the food after 40 minutes, brought 1 wrong order, 6 cold steaks, made us wait further to get the food and now you are telling me that I have to wait another 20 minutes? Right after 2 minutes, waiter came back with a steak and told me that its on the house which I refused and told him that the free food tactic will not change our experience with your pathetic services. Rest of the people were done with their food by the time. Bill arrived and guess what.....THEY FELT NO SHAME IN PUTTING THE SERVICE CHARGES IN THE BILL. I have been to Zamzama's one and always appreciate their service but I must say that Atrium Mall's Arizona has shown me new horizons of pathetic services.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-07T14:57:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-08T10:40:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"672864677","name":"Aamir A.

Apart from the rude and downright stupid waiters, the food was AWFUL and took about 30 minutes to arrive - that too, it came in bits a pieces; my husband's order came first, then mine - but the order was incomplete. I had the misfortune of ordering the chimichangas which were accompanied by ranch dressing (listed as 'Sour cream' on the menu), watered down chilli garlic sauce (listed as 'salsa') and two pitas (listed as 'flour tortillas'). When we complained to the waiters and even met the so-called manager, we were annoyed at how they really couldn't care less about our opinion. We insisted on speaking with the owner, but he didn't pick up his phone until about 2 hours later. Anyway, we left our half-eaten food and walked out - right infront of the 'manager' and waiters. We didn't bother paying, and the manager didn't think it was necessary to stop us either. absolutely disgusting.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-07T15:20:19+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"581804971870657","from":{"name":"Javeria Usmani","id":"797675206"},"message":"I too went there yesterday much to my regret and yes their staff is unattentive and the food is sub par.
