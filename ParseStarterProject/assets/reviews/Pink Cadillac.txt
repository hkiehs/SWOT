And it was heaven !\nHad dinner over there and it was outclass.\n\nSo here's what we ordered:\n \n1. V8 combo platter: it was one hell of a platter.. The sauces were delicious and chili bites, cheese sticks, chicken wings [cannot remember all the stuff because we literally jumped onto the platter :p]\n\n2.The Cordon Burger: the bun was soft and it had the yummiest chicken fillings in it.\n\n3. American Chicken: for all the spice lovers-it's a must have !\n\n4. Moroccan Chicken: was spicy and high on flavors.\n\nThe whole meal as compared to the cost was totally worth it. The food was delicious. The serving was prompt. Oh yes and we got a complimentary hot'n'sour soup that was served in an amazing bread bowl :)\n\nAmbience was okish as it's a hookah lounge too..but i guess when you are really hungry it's just the taste that matters and nothing else.

The experience over all was not too good not too bad. The service was rather slow, we asked ice like a million times for our lemonade and only then they gave us some. \n\nFor 1250 per head I was at least expecting 40+ dishes but alas that was not the case. The basic items for iftar were  beef samosas, vege rolls, channa chat, dhai barey, chicken cheese sandwiches and chicken wings. Channa chat was too spicy, nothing special about beef samosas but the sandwiches were good. There were 3 different types of salads out of which I only tried the macaroni one which I felt had a strong taste of chilli garlic ketchup. Iftar platter gets a 7 out of 10.\n\nThe main course had soup, alferdo pasta, small mushroom and pepper steaks, chicken chilli kind of something, mashed potatoes, drumsticks,  fried fish and I guess one other thing which I am forgetting. I will give an average of 6 out of10 on taste of the main courses. \n\nDessert Bar was the only delight with strawberry cheesecake, chocolate fudge cake, chocolate ?clairs, pineapple cake, chocolate mousse cake and pudding. Dessert Bar gets 8 out of 10.\n\nOverall experience 6 out of 10. My only suggestion would be to introduce variety of dishes instead of few.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-26T05:13:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-26T06:59:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100004345385201","name":"Syed Sharjeel Tirmizi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDA0MzQ1Mzg1MjAx","before":"MTAwMDA0MzQ1Mzg1MjAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"592661614118326","from":{"name":"Ahmad Owais","id":"688715909"},"message":"How would you rate the taste?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T05:53:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"592661857451635","from":{"name":"Bushra Joyo","id":"1421223164"},"message":"Average.
