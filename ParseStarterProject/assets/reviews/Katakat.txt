The food took one hour to come despite follow up with supervisors and waitors who were passing the buck from one to the other. The food items ordered were regular and running items out of which one dish arrived when we were in the middle of our meal. Finally when the food was served which was good, the drinks came when the food was over. We have never experienced such bad service at BBQ tonite as been going for years. They need to step up in their service to retain their good reputatiion and name.

Some fine tuning is required, some checks n balance is required, their is so much competiton but bbq was always a class of its own bc of quality and service, why is that eroding now??

Its just amazing how Mr Big with Egg n Cheese is perfect every time . It feels like they have time frozen the entire process for the last 20 years . Succulent , Flavoursome , Juicy Satisfaction all wrapped up in One little Piece of Heaven. I'd rate it 12/10 , 2 extra points for that smile on my face every time I take the first bite.\n\n2- Al Asif Square : Though a bit risky for some fellows but to be honest the place was packed . We had food at MADINA RESTAURANT which is located inside Al Asif Square and to some people's surprise there were few families around there as well ( well to do families at that ) enjoying food , the atmosphere was friendly we were greeted as warmly as always . We had the famous Dumba Boti , Afghani Pulao , Namkeen Gosht and Karahi.  Now i don't want to waste time in describing the brilliance of food . \nThat is the best Authentic Afghani food out there, Period , 11/10 . One extra point for the Afghan brethren for their every gracious hospitality. \n\n3- Tayyabi Restaurant : Located in Hussainabad. It one of the few unsung heroes of Karachi. We ordered Prawn Masala , KataKat , Chicken Chargha Fry, Malai Boti and Tikkas . Food was served a bit late as they prepare all the dishes fresh and from the scratch. \nPrawn Masala is one of the best in town as the prawns just melt in your mouth and mix with that zesty masala . THE DAMN ! \n\nKatakat and Chicken Chargha fry are good too . All in all yet another place you wont come out unsatisfied or cheated, EVER . 8/10 . -2 for the stolen side mirror of my friend's car from the parking :P\n\n4-  The Burger Shack: I have Shake Shack every week so it did not impressed me much. But i'd like to commend the owner for doing the best damn possible thing by cloning a famous international franchise's menu and making it possible to offer taste in it as well. I was not disappointed to say the least. 7/10\n\n5- Cafeela : Simply put , Zahoor bhai you rock . Okra Jalfarezi , Malai Boti , Nathiya Gali Qeema , Shahi Tukray , Chicken Yakhni Pulao are all yum. One of the best value for money in town. \n\nI am a safe eater and a Desi at heart as I get to eat really yummy mum cooked food and these are few of the places I go to eat or get food delivered when I want to eat out. Flying out tonight . Will Miss Karachi as I always do . Tada !","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-25T12:11:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-27T10:31:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"644528865","name":"Shirin Imani"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"647407601","name":"Syeda Rizvi"},{"id":"655910358","name":"Moiz Kazmi"},{"id":"549477264","name":"Junaid Wasti"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"1521133249","name":"Maouz Qazi"},{"id":"504239316","name":"Hala Qureshi"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"591166408","name":"Faisal M.

A lot has been written about it already, and it is probably one of the very few places which has an impeccable service record -- yet to find someone who hates it!\n\nWent to Kolachi on the third day of Eid, after a hiatus of about a year, and as expected the place was PACKED.  Atleast somewhere around 1000 individuals dining in, while roughly 500 just waiting to be seated -- and yet, everything went smooth.  The management wasn't freaking out, everything was under control, and more importantly the staff was courteous -- devoid of 'I'm working on Eid, so deal with my attitude' sort of behavior.  The food was served within 20-25 minutes of ordering, despite the insane rush -- and all of the food was served at the right temperature.  \n\nOne doesn't have to remind the management there twice about an order, which is often the case with many other places.  At the end of the meal, someone from the management was courteous enough to ask about the experience, and any suggestions; and are actually happy if one provides any criticism for further improvement (unlike many others out here).\n\nWe ordered Peshawari Karhai, Hunzai Karhai, Katakat, and Makhni Handi.  The karhai was delicious, although it may not be the best in the city, but given the ambiance, the flavor was just fine.  The creamy and delicious Makhni Handi is probably the best in the city, closely followed by Tandoori Hut.  The Katakat was pretty bland and sad, but that didn't really matter a lot.  With 13 persons, the bill came up to roughly PKR650 per person, which is pretty reasonable given the service quality, flavor, and the ambiance.\n\nKolachi should start up a boot camp to train the plethora of restaurants out here who are not able to serve even 20 individuals at the same time (let alone 1000!), and have egos the size of Mount Everest to understand the simple needs of a customer.  \n\nDespite the volume, Kolachi is able to do a commendable job, and certainly deserves all the praise that is written about it time and again.  Without any random service charges, without any pretentious attitude, without any rats (and hair), and without humiliating the customer, Kolachi is able to do a bloody good job.  Highly recommended despite an average waiting time of 60 minutes.\n\nOverall Rating -- 9/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-12T22:56:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-13T18:34:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"692650033","name":"Shahbaz Khan"},{"id":"1627178378","name":"Zubair Aziz"},{"id":"706724744","name":"Sara Khalid-Asad"},{"id":"100001187356169","name":"Kanwal Durrani"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"659377501","name":"Somia Rizwan"},{"id":"1058959259","name":"Furqan Zafar Batla"},{"id":"534041252","name":"Faizan Yahya"},{"id":"100005715342653","name":"Sikandar Gaba"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"566412813","name":"Mehreen Farhat Adil"},{"id":"792915494","name":"Ahmad Fayyaz Ali"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"749604523","name":"Muhammad Umer Khan"},{"id":"504565020","name":"Shehzad Ghias Shaikh"},{"id":"100004312661028","name":"Lyla Byramji"},{"id":"552080867","name":"Tabassum Ali"},{"id":"100001653271774","name":"Vardah Zamir"},{"id":"720585459","name":"Aisha Abrar"},{"id":"630661421","name":"Mariam Ali"},{"id":"673798071","name":"Sarmad Tahir"},{"id":"715140026","name":"Saniya Surani"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"684790179","name":"Farooq Shaikh"},{"id":"668781078","name":"Asim Raza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY4NzgxMDc4","before":"NjkyNjUwMDMz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_602343696483451/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjY4NzgxMDc4"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"602420949809059","from":{"name":"Muhammad Atif","id":"659193156"},"message":"Totally agreed for 'Karahi' point.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T02:55:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602454326472388","from":{"name":"Tauseef Haider","id":"1412656399"},"message":"Nicely described.

Firstly, a customer's opinion is their right and that must be respected. However, as I have said numerous times, there must be some detail to why the opinion exists for it to be useful in a public forum like SWOT. Simply referring to price and talking about the concept of value for money isn't enough. Nor is an unsupported remark about service in a passing comment. And as Ali Tariq said, it is absolutely true that value for money varies wildly for each individual and that is how it should be.  However, frankly at 2400 per head, I don't think you can eat extraordinarily at Pompeii or Okra etc ... starters average around 4-500+, main courses range between 700 and 2400+, desserts and drinks on top of that ... add tax and tip, you are easily around the 3000 mark or more. Again, while respecting the right of people to have their opinion, I am just making the point that we all need to be responsible, clear and informative in conveying that opinion ... be it positive or negative ... statements without details dilute the value of the opinion for those of us who actually read them with interest. Finally, and this is my own personal thing, if I am happy with my dining experience, then that is value for money received ... however, as Merchant Abid said, even the I may find the restaurant too expensive to become a frequent customer and that is also fair enough!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-03T04:55:41+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"519505693","name":"Ali Tariq","type":"user","offset":481,"length":9},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid","type":"user","offset":1349,"length":13}]},{"id":"552473951470426","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"It's a pity your experience was not worthy of the money you spent.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-03T05:04:27+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTUyNDczOTUxNDcwNDI2","before":"NTUxMzkwNjgxNTc4NzUz"}}},"restaurantName":"Katakat"},{"id":"165861103465048_550867964964358","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-30T20:20:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-01T21:00:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"100003553069288","name":"Chanelle Adam Khan"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1463201564","name":"ArtScene Galleries"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"},{"id":"696456252","name":"Simeen Ali"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"100003935625089","name":"Arshad Sahibzada"},{"id":"1367979764","name":"Shamsi Zia"},{"id":"567995082","name":"Hiba A Suleman"},{"id":"616208810","name":"Syed Fahim Inaam"},{"id":"100003898006618","name":"Zarfras Siddiki"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"734560115","name":"Syed Masud Naqvi"},{"id":"641324643","name":"Nadia Moqeet"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3Mjg3Mzkz","before":"MTAwMDAyNjUzODU0MjIx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"551169158267572","from":{"name":"Sabrina Shahid","id":"589565258"},"message":"dude yay angrezi katakat koi nahin khai ga !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!jis mein gurda kalaiji na ho","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-01T04:03:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"551169224934232","from":{"name":"Sabrina Shahid","id":"589565258"},"message":"missing ADNAAAN come back and comment","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-01T04:03:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"551193598265128","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"This page runs on DC and not AC","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-01T05:56:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"551195261598295","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Sabrina Shahid don't mock till you have tried it.

Prepared and served hygienically in disposable containers/plates.  Though I am not a Zinger type burger fan, however, people rave about Cool Inn's Zinger clone.  The masala dossa is also pretty decent and the Spicy Chicken Boti Bun has a unique flavour (be cautioned its really really spicy).  They also make a  great faluda and the cold-stone ice cream (which they call as Katakat Ice Cream) is very good for the price.  Love their dark chocolate flavour and have it  \"Katakated\" with Soft Mints with a topping of chocolate sauce.  They serve the Katakat Ice Cream in a waffle cup which is crispy and delicious.  A whole variety of ice cream flavours is available to suit all tastes. Cool Inn is a must visit place for all Chaat lovers.  Its great value for money.  The owner Noor Bhai is always present there and ensures quality and hygeine.  All their chutneys are made with mineral water and cooking/frying is done in Soya Supreme/Rafhan Corn Oil.

Went to have the Real Chiniot Kitchens' Kunnay in North Nazimabad, but was extremely dissapointed to hear that they only make them on order now for catering. And unless I wanted to pay 4000 and wait 24 hours for 5kg, I couldnt have it. Decided to go Donisl Snacks instead for my favorite Kat-a-Kat of all time, was not dissapointed at awwl. Donsil, in my opinion \u003e Noorani and all the rest who either put too much tamatar, or too much kaleji, gurda. Even took a pic for y'all . This place also has some chicken bhara chawal, with rice stuffed inside the whole chicken, and same with goat as well. But never got myself to try because anything else because I always end up stuffing myself with too much katakat.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-09T06:57:48+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-09T15:31:00+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100000370466528","name":"Sajjad Naqvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwMzcwNDY2NTI4","before":"NjQ3NzY1MjUz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"274336255950865","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"indeed, Donisl has some best food items............
