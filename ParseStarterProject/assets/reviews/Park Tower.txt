Its naturally churned and hence no crystallisation, the flavour was quite good but not natural, for a 4oz cup it's 130/- without toppings (that is charged according to the topping) and the 7 oz cup for 220/-. It melts to a liquids form indicating it is indeed low in fat. Also that it has a powdered mixed into water to enhance the flavour. The 26th street shop has more options in toppings than the initial Park Towers shop. As for point #9 yes for me.\n\n2) TUTTI FRUTTI\nNo the yogurt flavour was not obvious in any flavour other than the natural one. This was all purely artificial flavouring, the pricing is exactly the weight of the cup inclusive of the topping weight - and it's insanely reasonable. It melts down to pure liquid form - a powder mixed with water 100%. The flavours last till the end. Amazing variety of toppings and yes this is a fun alternate to all desserts (non-frozen included) since the make-your-own is too cute for words.\n\n3) SNOG\nFirst of all my first time in the shop and tasting...amazing place. The taste is ALL YOGURT, it was all natural no crystallisation, creamy till the end, with great flavor options and interesting toppings. Its alson the most expensive one in the market smallest cup starti at 340/- for 140gms. Toppings are of course extra. It melts to a foamy liquid - which clearly indicates a natural cultured yogurt. This is for the serious  FROYO lovers with a mature palate and not an alternate to other desserts. I see myself eating this more often than not. WELCOME TO KARACHI.\n\n4) UPPER CRUST\ncall me biased but this remains my ultimate place for frozen dessert heaven. The flavor and texture of this FroYo is evident in every flavor except the Belgian Chocolate. Yes the artificial sweetening can be detected as a slight bitter aftertaste in other flavours too. The dark rich Belgian chocolate covers that. But it's obvious in the fruity ones. It melts very slowly and becomes a heavy liquidy milkshake in the cup, so am thinking its not fat free, but I have seen this being made so I know the cultured yogurt used is free from all artificial additives. It's about 160/- for a small cup - for about 100-120 gms.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-17T07:32:56+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-17T22:35:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"523286481","name":"Adnan J.
