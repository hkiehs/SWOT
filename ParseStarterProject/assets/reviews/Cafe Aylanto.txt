I checked out the menu on Karachi Snob (as well as seeing this post) and the menu looked amazing. But then I was scared about the servings being small so opted for Roaster's on Zamzama for steak. First time I ever visited Roaster's. I heard so much about it but both my wife and me were a bit disappointed on the steak. Dry and no zest at all (she had the BBQ steak, I had the Tarragon), and way overpriced for that kind of quality. Arizona Grill steaks much better quality and better price. In the end Allah ka Shukar for the lovely night out and having a nice meal but won't ever think Roaster's again for steak (I heard their burgers better).  But I was sad that we opted out of Forty-4 last minute (its a 5-min walk from our home too and we believe in giving first patronage to people in the neighborhood :) The food looks very nice and immaculately crafted. I promise to make this up and give Forty-4 a try soon. We went to Cafe Aylanto few months ago and I think theirs was the best steak I ever had for the money. But will see Forty-4 soon Inshallah.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-06T17:09:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"629860190398468","from":{"name":"Usman Ul Haq","id":"1026991508"},"message":"re-quoting as some one said few days back on this page- \"Is this the kids meal?\" LOL","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-07T07:11:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI5ODYwMTkwMzk4NDY4","before":"NjI4ODQxMzMwNTAwMzU0"}}},"picture":"http://photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/t1/1380744_10152506141570288_764875419_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10152506141570288&set\u003dgm.628668147184339&type\u003d1&relevant_count\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif","restaurantName":"Cafe Aylanto"},{"id":"165861103465048_621784221206065","from":{"name":"Shayan Mehboob","id":"611865533"},"message":"Guys, please refer me to best Steak Houses / Cafes (serving steaks (preferably chicken) in Karachi..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-20T11:26:01+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-22T09:15:14+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"621785664539254","from":{"name":"Hiba Arif","id":"100000749114514"},"message":"Forty4, Gun Smoke, Cafe Aylanto","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-20T11:31:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"621785977872556","from":{"name":"Shayan Mehboob","id":"611865533"},"message":"I have already been to these places.

Complementary bread with garlic, and cucumber n some other veg with cheese mayo dip served. Both were good n I would rate them 8/10. We ordered cesar salad, the chicken quantity was very less for the hefty price. 6/10 Crepe champs elysees was good but overall not very filling quantity, 9/10. \n\nNow comes the steak. Ordered djonnaise steak, I was told it will be local tenderloin but I guess it was fillet mignon since the width was about 1.5 inch but the size was really small making it a total of 200 something grams. I ordered medium well but it looked pretty much medium, I requested them for it to be cooked more since and they changed it without any hesitation. 9/10. BUT it still does not beat the steak I ate in dxb, not even close and not that big as well.\n\nDidn't order the choc lava cake which was another reason to go there cuz I saw the dish being served on another table and it looked too tiny with vanilla icecream. \nOverall a good experience but too expensive for the quantity (2800 for 3 dishes of which 2 are starters). 10% service charge was applied but since it wasn't written anywhere I asked the manager to deduct it which he did, saving me 200+ rupees. I think it's a matter of principle and they should write it before charging.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-06T17:55:04+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"581431248574696","from":{"name":"Hamna Furqan","id":"667165223"},"message":"told u about the quantity :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-06T18:45:38+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"581647621886392","from":{"name":"Nasim Ahmad","id":"1343979604"},"message":"Thanks for the detailed review, Basit.

However, I have been to Forty4 several times in small and large groups and at various times of the week / lunch / dinner. One of the most consistently noticeable comments from my friends has been to acknowledge the service in addition to the food quality, selection and value. That said, I am sure that there have been issues as Aman Virji has acknowledged. For the record, I would not hesitate to take groups of friends or professional colleagues to Forty4! One restaurant that remains unmentioned is Pompeii which should be in the running as they do meet all the same standards that Forty4 has for our dining experiences. Have not been to Thyme or The Patio so I cannot comment, although others have said good things about both places ... especially The Patio. Aylanto has disappointed us multiple times with respect to food and at our last visit, we actually left without eating due to issues with the attitude of the staff. For that reason, we have not been to Aylanto for many months now and therefore things could be very different by now so it is hard for me to offer anything more than our prior experiences while acknowledging the passage of time. Okra is not a place we have visited very often but many of our friends go there and I have never heard anything but glowing reports about the food with the only cautionary factors being the small size of the restaurant and sometimes the availability of reservations. Cafe Flo has its diehard fans or people like me who feel that it is nice enough but not among our first choices. Hope your dinner goes well, wherever you decide to go!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-24T15:57:36+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"797300590","name":"Aman Virji","type":"user","offset":398,"length":10}]},{"id":"492455000805655","from":{"name":"Saad Ahmed","id":"602358073"},"message":"Okra.

The place has 180 seats at three different levels inc a lounge. We started off with Roasted Tomato and Broccoli Soup, for starters we had Spinach and Artichoke Dip, were also served complimentary bread basket, warm and fresh bread, the Soup was good topped with goat's cheese and well flavored. Main course comprised of Kalamata Chicken ? Marinated chicken with kalamata, green olives and sun-dried tomatoes and \nGrilled Fillet of Chicken with Rocket Grilled chicken topped with rocket leaves drizzled in delicate garlic olive served with Saut?ed mushrooms and vegetable timbale. The food was served hot and excellent presentation but the meat needed to be a tad bit more tender. For drinks we had Falsa Juice less sugar, a bit sour but authentic not artificial in flavor. Last but not the least desert was Warm Apple crumble with Ice cream, baked apple pie was a bit hard and required an effort to break but combined with Ice cream was delicious. Service was excellent, staff was polite, attentive and the manager was kind enough to ask us \"How was your meal\". One of the reasons for me to swot this place was to have an objective analysis as to how well team Aylanto is performing! after reading many negative reviews and not many reviews these days, Aylanto finally seems to be on track now, after weathering the storms, as the place was packed with people and they kept coming and coming till about 2:15 pm......which means they are delivering on quality of service.....only one thing seriously needs to be looked into, that is when the bill was presented it was simply on a piece paper with GST being charged at 16% and no proper bill was given with a valid GST no. The server was called and he gave the excuse that the machine was out of order, then the manager was summoned and he gave the excuse that the accountant is not present, and if we need the proper bill we will have to wait, as it will take HALF AND HOUR, then he under took the responsibility to have the bill delivered to our give address, we advised him to make it, scan it, and email it us, he committed he would do so, but unfortunately even after a passage of three hours when I write these lines no proper bill has been emailed. Cafe Aylanto which is one of the most prestigious and respected restaurants in Karachi, has done very well on all counts accept this one. This is a serious matter which they need to investigate and get back asap. If I am being charged GST, it is my right as a customer to insure that it is being accounted for in the proper manner, and not only charged, but accounted for and deposited in the respective gop account. This is not an allegation but an observation, early also they presented a bill which was on a piece of paper and not a properly printed one with GST no, complaint lodged and no action was taken which does not reflect well on this establishment. I am sure someone would like to clarify this issue.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-19T12:49:46+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-19T12:49:46+0000","restaurantName":"Cafe Aylanto"},{"id":"165861103465048_413426065375216","from":{"name":"Aamna Saiyid","id":"565939122"},"message":"Will someone please provide me contact numbers for Cafe Aylanto?

If one phrase were to sum up our evening, it would be that the attentive and seamless service of the evening surpassed their great food. I have to say, the management of Aylanto deserve 'shaabaashi' for how they have come around in regards to their service, timing, attentiveness and in being accommodating. \n \nNow about the food- goats cheese and broccoli soup, chilli prawns, and crab gratin got the festivities underway. The soup and the gratin were great- love their fine-dining interpretation of two ultimate confort foods- potato gratin and broccoli cheddar soup. However, the chilli prawns were a little overpowerring- they were not just spicy, but seemed to have been treated with a sort of garlic 'tharka', making them a bit oily and taking away from the flavor of the red chillis.\n \nOur entrees were lobster ravioli, served with a nicely balanced white sauce and cherry tomatos, which made each bite fresh as well as bringing out the sweetness of the lobster. However, we wished that the ravioli were boiled in water that was perhaps more salty. The second entree was the favorite steak chanterelle- cooked and rested to our preferences, but again, a little low in the seasoning.  Seems like the salt-police has chefs and kitchen staff everywhere holding back lately!!\n \nDesserts were to be had, though were were stuffed! The white chocolate cheesecake with bramble/ blackberry compote and tiramasu were divinely light as they were both creamy, cheesy, and sweet! I just wish that they had put a candle on the cake, as I had asked at the time of making reservations, but I guess it was alright, considering the indoor section of the restaurant was a little warm... but overall, a good evening, perhaps a sign of the wonderful year that lies ahead for the both of us!

It was around 1:30 pm. There was a large party of about 10 or so people in a corner of the restaurant, the rest of the place was empty. Raheel  had called ahead to inquire if they would be able to accommodate 5 adults and 2 kids and had gotten a positive response. Raheel, my brother and mom were to follow, we had gone ahead because the kids were hungry. \nUpon entering when I told the waiter that my husband had just called minutes earlier about us being 5 adults and 2 kids, he argued that he had been told 2 adults and 2 kids. I told him that the conversation had taken place in front of me and I know Raheel said 5 adults and 2 kids. \nAnyway, after some argument he finally took us to a booth and I requested a high chair for Ali. The same gentleman replied that the high chair could not be placed there. Fair enough, since the booths are placed on a kind of raised platform, the chair wouldn't be stable. So, then I asked him to relocate us somewhere where I could have a high chair. \nAnd the attitude that had started to deteriorate slowly, just took a dive and he walked off making a face without saying a word. Now as a customer I would expect someone to tell me something like, alright if you could just wait here (at some table) while we make arrangements. Instead we were just wandering around the restaurant wondering what we were supposed to do or where we were supposed to go. I saw waiters joining tables and we waited there assuming that they were doing it for us. It took them a substantially long time to put two tables together. \nWhen that was finally done, I requested the same waiter to please bring water and an order of fries first as soon as they could because Ali was very hungry and that when the rest of our party joined, we would then order together. It seemed like I was talking to the wall because he was halfway turned away, wouldn't even face me while I was talking to him and the expression on his face was just indescribable. He had such contempt on his face, it felt like he was feeding some homeless person (ehsaan ker raha tha). Then a waiter came and poured water in the glasses. Even my bhabi felt there was something wrong because she said that the next time someone came she would ask them if there was a problem because they were all giving us attitude. \nThen another person came and said that they only had 2 high chairs and they were both occupied. Now I hear they have a seating of 250 there and just 2 high chairs? Anyway, that's when I called Raheel who told me to ask them to hold the fries because we couldn't eat there with Ali and no high chair. So I did. One of them was courteous enough to say that the fries were almost ready but I had to tell him that we wouldn't be able to stay because of the unavailability of the high chair. And this person says something about the high chair being wiped clean or something which I was unable to fully comprehend. So I told him that's not what the other waiter told me, i.e. I was told that both your high chairs are unavailable. At that, they all seemed to kind of look from one to the other. \nThen the first guy tells the other one to take the money for the water which we had not even drank. So I paid 104 for water which we did not touch and walked out because the staff had absolutely no interest in persuading us to stay. You couldn't pay me to go there again.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-20T11:05:52+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"382790691772087","from":{"name":"Naheed Moini","id":"1425503961"},"message":"Now that is really something absolutely UNCOOL...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First and foremost, the fact that she and her bhabi felt that they were being disrespected with attitude and rolling eyes is unacceptable. It is a good thing that I did not know that when I went to pick them up because things would have become quite ugly! Further, if you did not hear me properly on the phone, no problem. In a largely empty restaurant, just make the adjustment and ensure that your customers feel taken care of rather than the exact opposite. And after all that attitude, when the customer is unhappy enough to leave, to have the guts to charge for anything is beyond me. My ONLY and MISGUIDED reason for even thinking about Aylanto after our lousy last lunch was the fact that the young man who came to check on our meal implored me to give them another chance! Plus, even though I insisted repeatedly to the contrary, he did not charge me for a couple of items that I was not happy with so I felt morally obligated to go back because that was never my intent in giving them honest feedback and frankly, I was uncomfortable about the free food even though it really was BAD BAD BAD (see earlier review). As things stand now, NOBODY but NOBODY, disrespects my family and gets off the hook. I will accept no apology or explanation and will not set foot in that below standard establishment ever again. They should count themselves very fortunate that I did not react to their behaviour and am just making myself heard on this page. No great loss to my life since there are many wonderful restaurants in Karachi and our outstanding lunch at CBG reinforced why we go there again and again!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-20T11:18:11+0000","like_count":14,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"701530863","name":"Mariyam Masood","type":"user","offset":41,"length":14}]},{"id":"382795531771603","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Naheed Moini: Agree that it was beyond uncool.

You can look really good like Aylanto does, but if the core of their business is rotten, the whole thing is worthless. And that is where they are now.

Last week was my birthday and I had planned on taking some friends out for a nice sit down dinner. The dinner was set for Friday and I called Fuschia on Tuesday to book their private room for 13 people. On Thursday I went to Fuschia and set the menu and increased the booking to 14 people, I was informed I will be able to accommodate 14 people in the private room. At 11:30 in the night I received a call from Fuschia informing me that they have no record of my booking for the private room and that I had just booked a table in the smoking section, they also informed me that the private room was already booked and the party had already paid a deposit.After arguing for a while the lady on the phone admitted she made a mistake with my booking, I understand human error is unavoidable but to realize this and inform me at 11:30pm the night before is unacceptable. I was extremely disappointed as I was looking forward to enjoying my night in privacy. In protest I cancelled my booking and was basically left without a venue 1 night before my dinner  :( and I knew finding a place for 14 on a Friday night would not be an easy task. A friend recommended Thyme, I called them up Friday afternoon and they graciously informed me they would make all the necessary arrangements for me on such short notice. Thyme did a lovely job, we took over almost the entire upper floor, I set a standardized menu (Chicken satay and Greek salad for starters and as mains an option of chicken in tarragon sauce, roast beef with risotto, prawn in thyme sauce or red snapper on a bed of crab meat) and they wrote out the options on their board for my guests. Dim lights, candles and soft music created the perfect atmosphere. The service was efficient, polite and it was an overall heart warming experience.... I highly recommend Thyme and really don't understand why it's not as popular as other similar restaurants.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T17:30:27+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-09T04:06:58+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"797300590","name":"Aman Virji"},{"id":"593086875","name":"Pervin Minwalla"},{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"668675270","name":"Maliha Ejaz"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"500616229","name":"Sama Aman"},{"id":"1768497575","name":"Ally Aadil Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTc2ODQ5NzU3NQ\u003d\u003d","before":"Nzk3MzAwNTkw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"374029089314914","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Wow.

I wish the weather were slightly better so we could sit outdoors, because the kind of racket these two separate huge groups of people were making, simply ruined our experience of such a serene setting. \n\nComing to the food, since I just wanted a light snack, I ordered Wasabi Prawns, to be followed by Tiramisu, and my husband ordered a regular cappuccino and Chocolate Fudge Cake with Vanilla Ice cream. It was rather disappointing to see just four medium sized batter-fried prawns placed on each corner of a rectangular platter with romaine and iceberg lettuce in the middle. Not just that, there was barely a hint of wasabi sauce brushed on top of the prawns. Rs 595 + tax for such a dish is a bit too steep by all standards! All I could think of at that time was Xander's OVERLOADED prawn sandwich! (which by the way, was what we had set out to eat initially, but the place was jam-packed and so I had the brilliant (?) idea of checking out Aylanto.) \n\nThe desserts fortunately were a saving grace and a half. The fudge cake was moist and dense, however, the ice cream was crystallized and even though we sent it back, the replacement was no better. My tiramisu was divine.. subtle balance of flavours, light and creamy . The coffee flavour was not overpowering but still made its presence felt. That is something I could go back to Aylanto for.. But I'll give it some time first to learn from and act upon the customers' feedback. \n\nThe service was fine, the manager was apologetic about the noise and commotion. Outdoors would be lovely once the weather improves. I really want to go back to Aylanto, hope they up their game soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T09:30:41+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-06T09:30:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"711699788","name":"Sanaa Zubairi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzExNjk5Nzg4","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"restaurantName":"Cafe Aylanto"},{"id":"165861103465048_300060816711742","from":{"name":"Rehan Shakur","id":"100000128733524"},"message":"Need to take some guests from abroad for dinner about ten people.
