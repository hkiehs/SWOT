(Do keep in mind that we were the only patrons in the restaurant till we left) on inquiring the dish was bought over to our table and once we took a bite the tempura were cold! We did not make a fuss about it and finished what was there and ordered another round of the same dish while informing the waiter to please make sure they are served to us the minute the food is ready, alongside we also ordered the 15 piece Sashimi platter. The Salmon was frozen not cold I repeat it was frozen! I called for the floor manager and he had no clue and his only response was that we are short on fish and this was taken out of the freezer. After the Sashimi fiasco we just paid for what we had consumed and left. On a side note we also ordered a bottle of Perrier, the menu says it?s a litter bottle for PKR 375 however the bottle that was served was 750 ml. they should fix their menu to what they are serving.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-27T12:42:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-28T12:37:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1642400541","name":"Fatima Kashif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTY0MjQwMDU0MQ\u003d\u003d","before":"MTY0MjQwMDU0MQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"562851837099304","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"WOW!

We arrived at 9:30pm for our 9:30pm reservation and were made to wait for 20 minutes until we were seated. The Maitre d didn't even apologize or offer us a cup of tea or something for making us wait. Then they forgot about us and we had to remind them that we were still waiting for our table. Finally I threw a bit of a fit and our table was miraculously made ready. Once we were seated we were forcibly served a pre-fixe \"Valentines Day\" menu that we were not told was our ONLY option in food when we made reservations. Just a side note. The only sushi on the pre fixe was ice cold salmon and tuna sashimi and three pieces of ice cold sushi that tasted like it had just been taken out of the deep freezer.\nThe waiter had no idea what he was serving so suddenly small  bowls of strange looking custardy, congealed masses were put on our table without any explanation of what we were eating. The food was awful. i don't even know what we were given since they didn't let us look at the paper copy of the pre-fixe menu. But it was cold and pretty tasteless. \nOnce we asked for the bill. We waited another 20 minutes and a harried looking Asian woman asked us twice if we had received it yet and then kept running in to find where the waiter was with it. The bill came and it came out to almost Rs.4000 per head. This was exorbitant considering the measly pieces of cold custard with apologetic prawns, the bad pieces of beef, the cold cold plate of sushi that we were given. \nI'm never going back to Oishi Sushi. And i don't usually critique restaurants but this was so, so bad that i had to write this as soon as i woke up to warn everyone not to go there.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-15T04:42:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-15T04:42:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1793536667","name":"Faiza M.

My wife Amrah Jung Tajik and I had ordered in from the Oishi Sushi at Port Grand (a couple of months ago) and were quite satisfied (although Japanese food is not something that one really should order in). \n\nI have to say, we fell in love with the place as soon as we walked in. The d?cor was exquisite: cozy, comfortable and brimming with authentic Japanese Zen. Although the indoor area looked extremely inviting, we decided to take advantage of the weather and sit outside on the floating deck (there is actually a fish-filled pond with a small waterfall beneath the deck!)\n\nThe meal began with complimentary green tea and hot towels. The menu was fairly extensive with all the descriptions, which made it very easy to order. For starters, the steamed dumplings with beef, veges and seafood were juicy and flavorful. We followed up with a fairly conservative choice of prawn tepenyaki and chicken teriyaki with a side order of garlic rice. The food was awesome. If I were to be picky, the only thing I could point out was the garlic rice, which seemed slightly drier than normal. Also, there was no dessert menu, although we were later informed that there was some sort of ice cream available on request. But this hardly affected the overall dining experience. Compared to other Japanese restaurants, Oishi Sushi is also great value for money. \n\nOverall: out-of-this-world environment, excellent food with warm and wonderful service. Hoping to see some interesting desserts on the menu next time we visit. Arigatou gozaimashita (Thank You) Oishi Sushi!

There was cheer among the people as there were many, which normally on a weekday the area is somewhat deserted.\n\nWas surprised at the interior of the restaurant, very well done as each and every inch was well utilised. Typical japanese interior, medium sized tables, upright chairs. Dim lighting but bright enough to see the plates and the dark colored chopsticks. \n\nOutside, there were tables carved out of pure seesham and soft chairs, ideal for 3 on each side.\n\nFor starters, there was all kinds of sushi... The aroma was very much inviting but since am allergic to raw fish, had a hard time to control myself. Helped myself to pickled Ginger and Raddish. Both were simply awesome as I have never had them before in any Japanese restaurants before. Raddish was sweet in taste, with a hint of orange and lime. Loved it so much that I asked for a second serving which was promptly brought to the table.\n\nThen came huge jumbo prawns, thick juicy and covered in that special crispy batter. Couldn't resist them so had a couple. Prawns were followed by California Maki, Spicy Tekka Maki, Tori Teriyaki, Ebi Tempura, Tori Teriyaki, Oishi Gyununiku Steak, Ebi Tepenyaki. \n\nEach and every serving was prepared to perfection with exceptional taste and served by well behaved and experienced waiters who also could speak couple of Japanese greetings. It was good to hear and see that the management has gone out of their way to train their staff.\n\nOne thing was annoying though.. as a policy of Oishi Sushi, there are no plastic bottles or alluminium cans allowed to be served on the tables, hence the only water they had was Evian water in a well shaped glass bottle.\n\nA real treat of a fine dinner.. Highly recommended..","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-28T13:24:35+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-29T06:18:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"1025016220","name":"Nabila Khawaja"},{"id":"626746793","name":"Hamida Najeeb Haroon"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"850419690","name":"Nida Huq"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ1NjIwMTMz","before":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"285715041479653","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"I am being jealous as how many ppl invite u ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T13:39:17+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285716544812836","from":{"name":"Khalid Lakhani","id":"711077848"},"message":"You can invite me too...but it will have to be after coming Tuesday, till then quite busy....","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T13:43:21+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285735018144322","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"What did you have Khalid bhai :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T14:28:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285736224810868","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"SARA please dont ask for anything as for any answer, he may ask for invite ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T14:30:49+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285738491477308","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Naaa he won't..
