Though it was more on the spicy side for me.\n\nI did not try the other one but according to another fellow swottie it was also quite good.\n\nStarters:\nFor starters we had Chicken Drumsticks, Prawn balls and Prawn Toast.\nThe starters were cold initially but after requesting them to change it we were served with fresh hot ones. \nPrawn toast was a personal favorite .\nI found the prawn balls to be quite bland.\nThey being cold ruined the taste for me a bit.\n\nMains:\nFor Mains there was\nChicken Manchurian:\nMy much raved about personal favorite. Was a Disappointment at RE. The CM lacked gravy and was quite dry and too sweet. But had generous amounts of chicken. It was more of a mashed mush rather then a saucy Manchurian.\n\nBeef in Oyester Sauce:\nDefiantly got me going back for more. Was super yum soft and moist. Bit on the oily side though.\n\nVegetable in Coconut Curry:\nTasted okayish. The veggies were cut quite large making it hard to eat.\nThe coconut curry was an interesting blend of flavors though.\n\nVegetable Chowmein:\nAgain I found it quite bland. Nothing to write about.\n\nThere was one more dish I'm forgetting.\n\nDesserts:\nThere was 5 kinds of desserts \nChocolate moose. Cheesecake \nCustard. Fruit chat. Walnut muffins.\n\nThe cheesecake was loved by everyone.\nI personally loved the chocolate moose.\n\nFRUIT CHAT on a Chinese buffet. Like seriously bhai kia chah rahay ho. Iftari thori hai :P \n\nOverall:\nHad an amazing time meeting up with the people who share the similar love for food. \nThe food was quite cold would have appreciated warmer servings.\nFor taste I would give it a 6/10\nChoice of dishes 5/10\n\nService on the other hand was exceptionally good.\nMeeting the owners themselves was quite pleasent.\nLoved our complimentey cups of greentea.\n\nPriced at 1100 per person. And promising 20+ dishes we found it quite disappointing in aspects of choice of dishes and taste.\n\nWould I go back for the buffet? NO.\nWill I go again because of their service at another time perhaps. YES.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-11T12:42:09+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-12T07:45:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"100001082786735","name":"Mahjabeen Khan"},{"id":"739935375","name":"Umer Latif"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"762775146","name":"Syed Faraz Baqar"},{"id":"524501080","name":"Zohaib Ali Memon"},{"id":"1107436825","name":"Xa?id Waqar"},{"id":"577774492","name":"Osamah Nasir"},{"id":"568861941","name":"Hassan Ahmed"},{"id":"1175769579","name":"Mohsin Mohiuddin"},{"id":"612945508","name":"Umair Shabbir"},{"id":"1282983841","name":"Hamza Kapadia"},{"id":"500786387","name":"Durand D'Silva"},{"id":"100000114960083","name":"Irfan Lala"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"100000238497030","name":"Madiiha N Narrejo"},{"id":"733018407","name":"Nabeel Kazi"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"709830622","name":"Saqib Pervez"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzI3NzkxMjA1","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc0MDgxMjMx"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_665038480213972/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzI3NzkxMjA1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"665040426880444","from":{"name":"Muhammad Abdullah","id":"1289258274"},"message":"Throughout the review your praising it but why so less score :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:47:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665041133547040","from":{"name":"Yasir Billoo","id":"807675696"},"message":"She is mainly praising it cause of the awesome company she was with :D right Ayesha :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:49:10+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha","type":"user","offset":77,"length":6}]},{"id":"665041723546981","from":{"name":"Muhammad Abdullah","id":"1289258274"},"message":"I'm sure, must have been fun.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:50:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665042180213602","from":{"name":"Mazahir Ali","id":"520175866"},"message":"Another cake in the making.... :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:51:58+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665046013546552","from":{"name":"Fareha Zarsheen","id":"612250309"},"message":"I tried red emperor just once before n didnt like it much.

It was full of ppl n the management didn't have a clue how to serve & what to do. They asked us to sit outside then we sat good about 20 min on an empty table with no crockery cutlery napkins or even given any menu. When I asked if there is any trouble serving outside we can leave they apologized n said will be with u then a waiter come n asked how many are we ????! Height. \nEventually they took the order n served us quick. Food tasted ok but I think there serving is toooooo small for the price. Two people n per head came out to be Rs. 2250/- is ridiculous. It was not five star place nor even food was out of this world plus serving was even less for a single person ya but bill was touching the sky.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-25T02:08:55+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-25T05:00:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"597235321","name":"Mehwish Ismail Kaloodi"},{"id":"100001428630184","name":"Mujtabamalik Malik"},{"id":"520882045","name":"Ghulam Ali"},{"id":"667511058","name":"Mohsin Makki"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY3NTExMDU4","before":"MTU0MjY2OTM5Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"609206142463873","from":{"name":"Mohsin Makki","id":"667511058"},"message":"wooo, are u talking about some place in karachi or what? its outrageous, in this price you could go to the top places of karachi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-25T02:14:24+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"609207225797098","from":{"name":"Nida Ali","id":"738115637"},"message":"Yes china kitchen in Karachi.

The disappointing part was the main course apparently the thai chow mien means a spicier version of Chinese chow mien. Than the real disappointment I am sure almost anyone been to Ginsoy must have had the cherry chilli chicken so I ordered it in RE as well there was no gravy it was fried dry chicken and instead of canned cherries or fresh cherries they had used the sugary type of cherries that you use in cakes which gave the whole dish a very weird sweetish kick. \n\nService was also good something Teamginsoy Ginsoy needs to take a lesson from as when in rush hours the service is not upto the mark.\n\nPricing was also similar to Ginsoy you can have half portions as well but that makes me question if I want Chinese why not go to Ginsoy ?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-28T09:40:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-29T14:52:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d","before":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"577638808953940","from":{"name":"Sana Abdullah","id":"627747302"},"message":"For service and ambiance.

However we'd like to clarify a couple of things. Firstly we are not in the market to compete with Ginsoy. We have no comparison with Ginsoy as they're serving Extreme Chinese and we're serving Hakka Chinese. Hakka Chinese is a distinct cuisine of Chine which is acquainting the market, at the moment. The names may be similar to our competitors but we're solely striving for our identity and not being a substitute for other eateries. The prices have been set to what matches our costing and market, nor an 'at par' comparison with Ginsoy. There is nothing 'wannabe' about it if our ambiance depicts the name we've given to our eatery. We're serving food to please customers like you and that would remain our first and foremost priority.

Anyways, not to dwell into farewell depression, i tried my best to cover all eateries as i could. Summary and ranking goes like:\n\nNew places:\n1. Bella vita- great gelato and a very different pizza! Must visit\n\n2. Kolachi- full marks for ambience( despite 50min wait) and one if the best beef botis, though garlic rice were a big disappointment! Karahi was great!\n\n3. Olivetto- tried there pan asian prawns with rice! Sluurrpp! Veryyyyy nice and must try!\n\n4. Xanders- very nice tomato soup and calamari starter, but the menu lacked depth for dinner. Suggest it to be a breakfast/brunch place thn dinners. Ordered jalape?o chicken pizza but the staff mistakenly served margarita. But they were courteous and apologetic! Hence, forgiven.\n\nOldies which are still goldies:\n\nNo one can beat Zahid ki nihari with garam garam naan still!!!\n\nBots was supreme!! The food covered up for poor service! Honestly, once it arrived (prawn karahi, fried pangush fish, fried prawns)we forgot tht it took ages to get someone to clean the table and take thr order. Ad always, didnt disappoint at all.\n\nTai pan- suprisingly great lunch food! Unlike many years ago whn i went and got served with a bee in the soup :) but this time,everything was awesome.\n\nGlorias beef chilli wrap also was a fav this trip!\n\nBoat basin ka subah ka halwa puri had still maintained its 'to die for' value! The dhaba roadside fun i miss!\n\nNandos- lemme tell you this, pakistans nandos takes the prize of the best nandos around! The depth in menu and the taste is what makes it the best!\n\nDynasty- unfotunately trip to dynasty was marred by sudden bout of sickness, and getting all food packed without even looking- the other disappointment was one of the best hotels in town didnt have panadol in first aid, and the pharmacy hd closed at 9! Made me wonder, wat wud guests do if they needed it in middle of night.\n\nChairman mao- no compromise on quality- still the same good hot n sour soup, chicken schezuan and fried rice!\n\nChatkharay and gazebo- never fail to bring your taste buds alive with the bun kabab, chaat and qeema!\n\nAnddd pompei- blue cheese pizza rocks my socks :)\n\nYummmmm!

Aylanto (yeah it's alphabetical : P) because of freshness of ingredients. and best value for money in fine dining. \n2. BarBQ2night: for its (ISO certified) quality, consistency, cleanliness, & of course their German precision food engineering: P     \n3. CBG: oh this requires an academic thesis, or @least a drawing room discussion, a 1liner is not enough.\n4. Patio: cutesy, warm ambiance, gr8 food and different menu4a change. (no its not alphabetical ;P)\n5. Fujiyama: for the best Japanese in town\n6. Desi: best array of desi flavors under one roof, w/ the good looks & charms of a secret recipe, literally : P\n7. BOTS: best sea food variety under the blue sky, second only to the ocean : P\n8. Log Inn Lounge: for the best chill-out Drinks, food, & conversations on food and of course politics : P\n9. Cafe Gracias: for the best authentic Mexican in town! :P\n10. The upper crust: for having the best fro-yo, panini cheese steaks, belgian chocolate/ RVcake ever.        \n11. The Pakistani at Sheraton- great ambiance, attentive service, love the rose water scented pre-dining hand-rinsing, the post-dining paan and dessert trolley, and a wonderful way to impress family and friends visiting from Abroadzzz.\n12. Crescent Nimco in Bahadurabad- great samosas, chaats, jalebis, chai, kahva, and superb selection of nimco items to take home for when you are feeling like DIY-desi snacks.\n13. This is a tie between Tutti-Fruiti, for its unique self-serve experience and sugar fee varieties, and Berrylicious cuz they are simply sugary-sweet and opening up at Port Grand!\n14. Port Grand- clean and fun atmosphere, with smelly-free views of the harbor, nice walking and shopping, good security, and a decent variety of food for all budgets and tastes. Plus, this allows us to hoot and holler (yeah, i almost became a lawyer, like the loophole?) about Aylanto Bistro and Ghaffar Kabab Hoouse, even though the one in Delhi Mercantile is waaaaay better and more generous!\n15. Dynasty- best Chinese.\n16. Hot n Pepper on Bahria- best malai tikkah rolls. ever!\n17. Butlers- for their 'super-sexxxxy-mocha'- yes, you can go there and ask for it, it's basically extra chocolate syrup..\n18. Olivetto- where else can you get the options for fine-dining or lounge, both with excellent menus?\n19. Koel cafe- for their 'fire and ice' drink, which much like the owner, is the quntissential embodiment of Eastern elegance and taste, met with a certain Western and Worldly sophistication. \n20. The dark brown, unsliced, artisan breads at Hyperstar's bakery. their almond croissants (buttery croissants with actual almond paste inside) too, which are available every now and again on sundays.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-12T08:08:35+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-12T15:46:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"689771441","name":"Riffat Fawad Bukhari"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAyODQxNzU4","before":"NTgyOTYwNTc1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"396668170384339","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Fawad.

I wasn't as adventurous as to try the prawn on toast but since it was devoured I'm sure it was pretty fantastic too.\nI also tried the duck for the very first time and to my surprise quite liked the meat. But since i'm not an expert on duck meat cant say more :)\nKung Pao chicken at China K keeps getting better with every visit. The Orange chicken was zippy and full of flavor. Another favorite was the Singapore Noodles, a perfect, seasoned and light combination of veggies and noodles. The wasabi sauce on the Wasabi prawns was a little too sharp. And how can i forget the Crispy Beef? The sticky sauce is so tangy and rich - heavenly!\nIt was a perfect meal, everyone at the table enjoyed their food, the ambience was lovely and we were probably the loudest bunch in the restaurant. \n\nSpecial thank you to the hostess :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-04T21:48:47+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-06T08:12:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"100001432075867","name":"Suhaila Tobeh"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"738981577","name":"Sohail Maskatiya"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzM4OTgxNTc3","before":"Nzc3MjMzMDQy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"392586077459215","from":{"name":"Ahsan Rasheed","id":"199900911"},"message":"How were serving sizes?

I've left out 5 of my favorites from this list namely Dynasty, Fujiyama, Pakistani & KababJi for the simple reason that these are not smoker friendly places and Pompei because of its location.    Have also left out Aylanto and Fuchsia that used to be on my favorites list for a long time because of late their quality has deteriorated. So here's the list in my order of preference: \n1. Xanders\n2. Sakura\n3. Okra\n4. Flo\n5. Biryani Of The Seas (BOTS)\n6. Cafe Blue Ginger (CBG)\n7. Olivetto\n8. Bundu Khan\n9. Deli\n10.

We happen to go to China kitchen some time back for which I had made a reservation in advance. When we go there, I was told that we could not be accommodated inside where we were initially booked for and the only option was to sit out side. It was not a matter of sitting outside but the way the hostess put it was, take it or leave it. There was someone already sitting on then table apparently waiting for their table inside. Our guests started to arrive so we decided to just take the table. The setup was actually thrown on the table, without actually being. The way they  took the order was if we had done a favor coming to the restaurant. The food was very average - Dynasty @ Avari is still the best and there is no comparison. Anyway the dinner ended and as I drove off, I realized the I realized the left hand mirror on the door had been ripped and stolen. I called the restaurant back when I reached home I was spoke to the hostess who said to send her the bill for the repairs.  After having the mirror repaired thru the insurance i took the bill for balance payments as insurance companies deduct for depreciation. At the restaurant the hostess simply refused to accommodate as she says it was on the slip when I had the car valet parked that it was on my own risk. Her attitude was again rude and arrogant. Something which I should I have expected as she showed it the day we went there for dinner. I just took the bill back and walked out. While I do understand that cars are parked at owners risk, there is still a duty of care the owners are supposed to provide. She did mention that they have tried to remove the druggies from around the neighborhood who could have possibly stolen, but it was not there fault. Since then I have decided not to go there. I thought of posting this earlier but decided against it. The new restaurants, and the look restaurants must remember the first thing about hospitality it's customer service.  Even if you want to say no, they must learn to say it politely  .","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-20T15:46:50+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-21T12:12:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"780833634","name":"Erum Ahmed"},{"id":"654298693","name":"Huma Akhter Mundia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjU0Mjk4Njkz","before":"NzgwODMzNjM0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"382920588425764","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"And this is why I won't be goin bak to CK for a long long time.....and if I did...it prob be a favor to them.

Our waiter (Javad) is something truly exceptional.  He remembers our names, our favourite dishes, and has yet to tell us \"No\" for any request. \n\nB - They cook probably the finest steaks around town.  Whether you order the medallion, the tenderloin, or the rack of lamb (cheating this isn't a steak); they UNDERSTAND their meat.  Do you want medium rare? They'll give you medium rare.  This is an international standard being upheld.  \n\nC- There has never been an issue with quality.  The standards have always EXCEEDED my expectations. The layout is gorgeous, the temperature is always just right, and they go out of their way to take care of you if come in sick. \n\nD- Pricing is fantastic.  Cafe Flo', Dynasty, and Saffron charge an extra 10% on top of the 16% GST.  This brings the total to a hilarious 26% plus tip.  I've began to notice others following this trend.  Olivetto not only looks the part, but the prices are competitive when competing against the dinosaurs of Karachi Lifestyle dining.\n\nI just want to tip my hat to Afroza Bhamani and Afroze Khan. You have created something truly special.  Please wait for my full review. \n\nI thank you for your time.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-05T07:34:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-05T07:34:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"586043191","name":"Mustafa Mohomedally"},{"id":"100000093496883","name":"Ryeaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"1137915284","name":"Mohammad Bin Zia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzNzkxNTI4NA\u003d\u003d","before":"NTA0MDkzOTk3"}}},"restaurantName":"Dynasty"},{"id":"165861103465048_302087983175692","from":{"name":"Nida Huq","id":"850419690"},"message":"Had Chinese dinner at Dynasty tonight, wasn't happy that chef Yu not present!
