Around 8 o clock, I received another call from the owner of WOK who showed great concern about the issue and wanted to send something complimentary to make up for the food sent earlier. He even asked what time specifically I would like to have my meal. I really appreciate this gesture because it shows that they really value their customers.\n\nThe food was delivered on time and was hot. The packaging was good and serving size was very generous. The food was very decent in taste this time specifically the Fish and Egg Fried Rice were very good. The only flaw was that there was no salt in the Vegetable Rolls whereas the Almond Chicken had a bit too much of salt. Anyway, I really appreciate the prompt response from the management and the owner himself.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-23T17:30:18+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-27T17:36:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"1065859702","name":"Ammara WAsti"},{"id":"592317993","name":"Muhammad Adil"},{"id":"530060365","name":"Abdul Wajid Qureshi"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"522977702","name":"Sheikh Hasan Rasul"},{"id":"734291566","name":"Baneen Shahbaz Ladak"},{"id":"554875549","name":"Imran Siddiqui"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"100000999733392","name":"Hadi Khan"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"516138880","name":"Salik Aleem"},{"id":"100000087144502","name":"Nadia Nadeem"},{"id":"1109359970","name":"Altaf Suleman"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100002348421122","name":"Aahad Zubairi"},{"id":"849920390","name":"Umer Rashid"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"734678626","name":"Rubaya Zia Khan"},{"id":"100002505633547","name":"Umme Kulsoom Khalid Ahmed"},{"id":"100002619919449","name":"Maleeha Athar Zubairi"},{"id":"1206288860","name":"Sundila Sadiq"},{"id":"100003216046346","name":"Shezi Memon"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAzMjE2MDQ2MzQ2","before":"NzIwMjE3NjIy"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_623376991046788/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTAwMDAzMjE2MDQ2MzQ2"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"623378421046645","from":{"name":"Syed Abdul Haye","id":"510482528"},"message":"haha @no salt","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-23T17:33:11+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"623378927713261","from":{"name":"Moazzam Husain","id":"559218922"},"message":"Thanks for sharing Sadia.
