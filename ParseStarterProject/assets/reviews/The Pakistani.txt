You will find a select variety of similar dishes at The Pakistani (Sherato) and Dumpukht (Marriott) albeit in a limited version. Overall, Karachi does not have too many North Indian/Mughlai food places that are abundantly found in other parts of the world, especiialy UK, Europe, North America and the Middle East. Pakistani food is more onion/tomato based that is grounded in ghee for flavor whereas a lot of North Indian cuisine is texture-based and uses rich thickeners like fresh cream, dried fruit pastes and yogurt as well as pureed forms of vegetables i.e. spinach, palak, onions are usually pureed to create a thick aromatic curry. Some of the dishes you maybe able to find at Nawab would include Chicken Makhni (Indian style), Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Kashmiri, Mutton Roganjosh, Vegetable Makhni, Palak Paneer, Palak Kadai and Dal Makhni (with red beans: rajma) to name just a few. Also, at The Pakistani you can request the chef to make a dish of your choice that's not on the menu and usually he'll fix you something custom to your taste buds (esp if it's a weekday and there aren't too many people around). I so can relate to your craving for this genre of food; too bad the options are limited in Karachi on this one.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-27T18:46:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"625216677529486","from":{"name":"Saba Noor","id":"832395133"},"message":"Thank you so much babar ...

Aylanto (yeah it's alphabetical : P) because of freshness of ingredients. and best value for money in fine dining. \n2. BarBQ2night: for its (ISO certified) quality, consistency, cleanliness, & of course their German precision food engineering: P     \n3. CBG: oh this requires an academic thesis, or @least a drawing room discussion, a 1liner is not enough.\n4. Patio: cutesy, warm ambiance, gr8 food and different menu4a change. (no its not alphabetical ;P)\n5. Fujiyama: for the best Japanese in town\n6. Desi: best array of desi flavors under one roof, w/ the good looks & charms of a secret recipe, literally : P\n7. BOTS: best sea food variety under the blue sky, second only to the ocean : P\n8. Log Inn Lounge: for the best chill-out Drinks, food, & conversations on food and of course politics : P\n9. Cafe Gracias: for the best authentic Mexican in town! :P\n10. The upper crust: for having the best fro-yo, panini cheese steaks, belgian chocolate/ RVcake ever.        \n11. The Pakistani at Sheraton- great ambiance, attentive service, love the rose water scented pre-dining hand-rinsing, the post-dining paan and dessert trolley, and a wonderful way to impress family and friends visiting from Abroadzzz.\n12. Crescent Nimco in Bahadurabad- great samosas, chaats, jalebis, chai, kahva, and superb selection of nimco items to take home for when you are feeling like DIY-desi snacks.\n13. This is a tie between Tutti-Fruiti, for its unique self-serve experience and sugar fee varieties, and Berrylicious cuz they are simply sugary-sweet and opening up at Port Grand!\n14. Port Grand- clean and fun atmosphere, with smelly-free views of the harbor, nice walking and shopping, good security, and a decent variety of food for all budgets and tastes. Plus, this allows us to hoot and holler (yeah, i almost became a lawyer, like the loophole?) about Aylanto Bistro and Ghaffar Kabab Hoouse, even though the one in Delhi Mercantile is waaaaay better and more generous!\n15. Dynasty- best Chinese.\n16. Hot n Pepper on Bahria- best malai tikkah rolls. ever!\n17. Butlers- for their 'super-sexxxxy-mocha'- yes, you can go there and ask for it, it's basically extra chocolate syrup..\n18. Olivetto- where else can you get the options for fine-dining or lounge, both with excellent menus?\n19. Koel cafe- for their 'fire and ice' drink, which much like the owner, is the quntissential embodiment of Eastern elegance and taste, met with a certain Western and Worldly sophistication. \n20. The dark brown, unsliced, artisan breads at Hyperstar's bakery. their almond croissants (buttery croissants with actual almond paste inside) too, which are available every now and again on sundays.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-12T08:08:35+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-12T15:46:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"689771441","name":"Riffat Fawad Bukhari"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAyODQxNzU4","before":"NTgyOTYwNTc1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"396668170384339","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Fawad.

Let me correct you. We DO listen to our clients and we DO consider their opinions very seriously. That is when they GIVE us their opinion or complaint. If you could come back home and make the effort of writing this post here, I am sure it would have been easier to let us know there. I personally call customers and even invite them to have a meal with me and we scrutinize the food and implement all the positive findings. I have personally in my car DELIVERED food to an unsatisfied customer at their DoorStep. So please dont teach me customer relationships. Just the fact that instead of complaining to me or to the manager you complained online goes to show that your only intention was defaming us and NOT for us to consider improving anything. Palwasha Khan had a problem and she complained and it got fixed. At least she did not deny that she has otherwise always enjoyed the food. The rest of her problems WILL be taken care of. I would have completely missed this post had Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi not tagged me in in the first place.

Also, let me make it clear that I don't know any of the people involved nor have I been to Cafe 76. Personally, if I have a problem with the food being served to me at a restaurant, I would call over the manager or someone to let them know immediately and give them a chance to fix it... and would not wait for the comment card to be given. That way, if I was unsatisfied with the response, then I could say that there was no satisfactory management response after they were given an opportunity to fix things. Also, if I did own a restaurant, even if I did not appreciate the method or timing of the customer complaint, I would take notice since where there is smoke, there is fire. There may be an underlying agenda, but surely there has to be some issue ... small or not ... that exists and bears investigation. I think both sides could do things better and that SWOT is not about blame or mud slinging but it is for all of us to share experiences ... whether positive or negative ... for the benefit of everyone who reads this page. Just my two cents!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-06T11:02:28+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjcyNjQ3MTI2MTE5Nzc4","before":"MjcxMzYzMTU5NTgxNTA4"}}},"restaurantName":"The Pakistani"}]}
