The noodles, the green curry chicken, the prawn tempuras.....I have no words to express the joy that this place has given me. The curry was, no jokes, at par with the green curry I had at Fuchsia. It didn't have anything in excess (which I always take out)...the amount of mushrooms, baby corn, chicken, coconut milk, the consistency of the curry, the fact that it did not have an overdose of ANYTHING like the leaves or other thingys....I am SO happy its not even funny......The noodles...never had anything like that earlier so cannot really compare it to any place BUT it was again SUPERB AND JUST perfect, again no overdose of peanuts or veggies...just the way I love pasta!!!!
