It was a successful event and we had a great time meeting new people :)  \n\nFirstly last night was one of the coldest nights by far and I thought we were going to turn into popsicles but thanks to the  management at Sajjad that didn't happen. It was unusually and surprisingly warm. Its covered from all sides and has fires burning at different spots which is really nice. So this answers the question for all who have been seeking a warm spot at do darya.\n\nNow to the FOOD.\nStarters: Chicken Dhakka, Hot and Sour Soup, BBQ prawns, lemon chicken and fish dhakka.\n\nMains: Afghani Boti, Chicken karhai, Shahi Handi.\n\nSTARTERS:\n? Chicken Dhakka: \n The most loved starter off all time I assume. It had been wiped clean off the dish as soon as it hit the table. Boneless chicken fried in a delicious batter served with this amazing sauce. Hands down the best dish on the menu and a must must try.\n\n?Hot & Sour Soup:\nDefiantly has room for improvement. But since we were sitting in a Pakistani themed Resturant i didn't expect a tiny Chinese man dancing out of my soup. So all good.\n\n?BBQ Prawns: \nOk i am not a seafood person at all. So according to the people who ate them they did enjoy. Its a very interesting dish. Plain simple flavours which enhanced the taste of the prawns \n\n?Lemon Chicken:\nAnother of my favorites. YUM i felt like im in chicken heaven. Crunchy chicken fried perfectly packed with that lemon zing. At the same time it didnt over power the chicken.\nI would keep going back for that.\n\n?Fish Dhaka:\nAnother one of the yummi delights. Me not being a sea food person fell for them like i slipped on a banana peel. \nMust try again. A complete winter dish\n\nMAINS:\nWe had stuffed our selfs with the starters lol\n\n?Chicken Karhai:\nJust has a taste but now i know why are they famous for it. Tasted yum.\n\n?Afghani Beef Boti:\nI can keep returning for that every single day. Soft, filled with taste, melts in the mouth. Neither to spicy neither bland just the right amount of spices.\n\n?Shahi Chicken Handi:\nA shahi handi for a shahi gathering lol. \nI love it. Boneless chicken chunks cooked in butter and topped with cheese and hints of fresh herbs. It has that yummy creamy subtle taste. Geez my mouth still waters for it. Total justice to the dish.\n\nOverall: \nGreat service.\nFood arrived hot and on time.\nAttentive staff.\nLoved the plastic covers against the wind. \n\nSpecial thankyou to all the foodies that showed up. \nHope to see u all soon.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-29T14:35:00+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-02T21:31:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"541880374","name":"Noreen Ahmed"},{"id":"100001434743152","name":"Raza Rehmani"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"100003570224157","name":"Kashif Khan"},{"id":"100001356574653","name":"Rude Plannet Kennel Rpk"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"532470690","name":"Sana Zaeem"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"887535136","name":"Jabbar Abdul"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"796000540","name":"Nisa Abdul Basit Khan"},{"id":"100001217752738","name":"MehRose Khan"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"729875068","name":"Soomro Ali"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"733018407","name":"Nabeel Kazi"},{"id":"100002943458913","name":"Aisha Wali Muhammad"},{"id":"1356485615","name":"Samrah Owais"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5MjA0NTUy","before":"MTAwMDA1NDIxODIzNTg4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_674208709296949/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzQ5MjA0NTUy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"674210079296812","from":{"name":"Zohaib Ali Memon","id":"524501080"},"message":"need to make it to one of these some day","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:38:13+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213699296450","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"So who all came?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:10+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213745963112","from":{"name":"Khozema Soni","id":"513558813"},"message":"If this event took place why was that girl siting alone ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:18+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674216695962817","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Khozema Soni well there was a bit of miscommunication.

I'm not a fan of meat but had mutton karahi last time, just the gravy and its the best karahi I've had in Karachi to say the least. Despite being so crowded, thumps up for maintaining the quality, ambiance,  customer service and punctuality of the waiters to serve the food.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-15T10:52:45+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-15T10:52:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"697750147","name":"Mohammad Ismail Asif"},{"id":"567175539","name":"Maha Laka"},{"id":"561320112","name":"Mehreen Y.

A lot has been written about it already, and it is probably one of the very few places which has an impeccable service record -- yet to find someone who hates it!\n\nWent to Kolachi on the third day of Eid, after a hiatus of about a year, and as expected the place was PACKED.  Atleast somewhere around 1000 individuals dining in, while roughly 500 just waiting to be seated -- and yet, everything went smooth.  The management wasn't freaking out, everything was under control, and more importantly the staff was courteous -- devoid of 'I'm working on Eid, so deal with my attitude' sort of behavior.  The food was served within 20-25 minutes of ordering, despite the insane rush -- and all of the food was served at the right temperature.  \n\nOne doesn't have to remind the management there twice about an order, which is often the case with many other places.  At the end of the meal, someone from the management was courteous enough to ask about the experience, and any suggestions; and are actually happy if one provides any criticism for further improvement (unlike many others out here).\n\nWe ordered Peshawari Karhai, Hunzai Karhai, Katakat, and Makhni Handi.  The karhai was delicious, although it may not be the best in the city, but given the ambiance, the flavor was just fine.  The creamy and delicious Makhni Handi is probably the best in the city, closely followed by Tandoori Hut.  The Katakat was pretty bland and sad, but that didn't really matter a lot.  With 13 persons, the bill came up to roughly PKR650 per person, which is pretty reasonable given the service quality, flavor, and the ambiance.\n\nKolachi should start up a boot camp to train the plethora of restaurants out here who are not able to serve even 20 individuals at the same time (let alone 1000!), and have egos the size of Mount Everest to understand the simple needs of a customer.  \n\nDespite the volume, Kolachi is able to do a commendable job, and certainly deserves all the praise that is written about it time and again.  Without any random service charges, without any pretentious attitude, without any rats (and hair), and without humiliating the customer, Kolachi is able to do a bloody good job.  Highly recommended despite an average waiting time of 60 minutes.\n\nOverall Rating -- 9/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-12T22:56:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-13T18:34:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"692650033","name":"Shahbaz Khan"},{"id":"1627178378","name":"Zubair Aziz"},{"id":"706724744","name":"Sara Khalid-Asad"},{"id":"100001187356169","name":"Kanwal Durrani"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"659377501","name":"Somia Rizwan"},{"id":"1058959259","name":"Furqan Zafar Batla"},{"id":"534041252","name":"Faizan Yahya"},{"id":"100005715342653","name":"Sikandar Gaba"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"566412813","name":"Mehreen Farhat Adil"},{"id":"792915494","name":"Ahmad Fayyaz Ali"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"749604523","name":"Muhammad Umer Khan"},{"id":"504565020","name":"Shehzad Ghias Shaikh"},{"id":"100004312661028","name":"Lyla Byramji"},{"id":"552080867","name":"Tabassum Ali"},{"id":"100001653271774","name":"Vardah Zamir"},{"id":"720585459","name":"Aisha Abrar"},{"id":"630661421","name":"Mariam Ali"},{"id":"673798071","name":"Sarmad Tahir"},{"id":"715140026","name":"Saniya Surani"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"684790179","name":"Farooq Shaikh"},{"id":"668781078","name":"Asim Raza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY4NzgxMDc4","before":"NjkyNjUwMDMz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_602343696483451/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjY4NzgxMDc4"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"602420949809059","from":{"name":"Muhammad Atif","id":"659193156"},"message":"Totally agreed for 'Karahi' point.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T02:55:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602454326472388","from":{"name":"Tauseef Haider","id":"1412656399"},"message":"Nicely described.

Originally my family and I wanted to go and have sehri at bbq tonight but there was a 20-30 minute waiting and since it was already like 3 in the am we decided against it. Ended up going to boat basin and the family members wanted to have handi/saalan type food we ended up going to Nihari Inn. I, personally was not fond of this place as is because I had gotten food poisoning the first time I ate here which was around 6 years ago. But the second experience was the cherry on top. Ordered the boneless chicken handi which tasted like chicken karahi..when we asked the waiter he said it was chicken karahi cooked in a handi.. Then we asked the manager and HE said it was infact chicken handi cooked in a karahi! Wth? Ordered the dhaaga wala kabab.. Which i didnt have because I dont like it. But according to my family it was good. Ordered plain nan and when I asked for garlic naan the manager was like we dont have that here.. Dude how hard is it to make garlic naan?? And I ordered the boneless chicken boti. The boti was ok but too spicy and there was no salad with it. The dhaga wala kabab didnt have salad either..upon enquiry we were told that the salad was infact the bowl of onions on our table and that too for both of our dishes COMBINED. When the waiter asked for drinks I ordered pepsi and he told us sorry sir pepsi thandi nahi hai but I let that go and ordered a mountain dew. Aaaaaand that wasnt cold either -_- Never going back there again!

So yesterday I decided to give them a visit. And with no surprises, everything I heard was true. Endless variety of food including BBQ, Chinese, Handi, Afghani, Italian,etc. ,etc., and what not. Although, the differentiating factor which separates Kolachi from all other infinite menu list buffets in town, each and every item was fresh and scrumptious and hard to resist, making it impossible to taste all of them. Specialties being Prawn tempura, Malai Boti, Paneer Reshmi, OOzi and Karhai. These are items for which you definitely need reserve some space in your appetite. And what to say about desserts, simply divine and celestial.\nA few negligible cons, long ques on high running items but visible efforts by staff to manage the crowd.  Secondly, when I called them two days back to reserve the water front table, I was told that they are not making reservations. Therefore I made sure to reach max by 6:15 pm, and was told that all water front tables are already reserved!!!!! And lastly the sitting area in the lounge was very hot and dark and to make it worse, red dim light hanging over our head. \nAll in all, I would like to thank Kolachi for treating my taste buds although there is still room to improve their aesthetics.\nScore : 8.5 /10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-02T06:15:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-02T10:27:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"716476797","name":"Rania Jawaid"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"690005614","name":"Owais Asif"},{"id":"100000108654676","name":"Samia Hyder"},{"id":"100002991745435","name":"Asmma Omer Khan"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"1200204425","name":"Sana Zaidi"},{"id":"100003829944979","name":"Saba Farooq"},{"id":"660435505","name":"Sajjad Bin Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjYwNDM1NTA1","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"596871450364009","from":{"name":"Saad Ahmed Qureshi","id":"739137597"},"message":"thnx for the detailed review, its helpfull","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-02T10:27:53+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTk2ODcxNDUwMzY0MDA5","before":"NTk2ODcxNDUwMzY0MDA5"}}},"restaurantName":"Handi"},{"id":"165861103465048_595281207189700","from":{"name":"Syed Talha Izhar","id":"713665522"},"message":"I am in a mood to try the old school Karahi tonight and don't wish to go too far.

Malai boti was very soft and smooth but lack of some strong flavour. In addition just to taste and sense the flavor of continental food we ordered Pasta which is again very delicious and highly recommended. The only gap is in their services where each waiter and server take care of 2-3 table at the same time and in certain situation they do not answer U which make us frustrated.

The service was very prompt, friendly and attentive. But in terms of food, it remained a few notches below the ambrosial feast that I was anticipating given the rave reviews here. \n\nOur spread included:\nCream of Chicken Soup.. Very rich and creamy. The kids loved it!\nPaneer Reshmi Handi.. Delicious, but a tad bit over-rated. Honestly speaking, it tasted just like pasta in white sauce sans the pasta! This was pointed out by my 7-year old, and after that I had a hard time eating it with naan. :/\nSeekh Kababs, Behari Chicken Boneless, and Malai Tikka.. all were good but I've had better! Malai tikka was slightly undercooked. (Seriously!!)\nGarlic naans: the first two were dry and hard, the third one was soft and fluffy (since we had complained about the first batch) and then the fourth one was again like the first two.  \n\nAll food was delivered hot and fresh (barring the naans), and stayed so despite the open air seating. The floor manager was very interested in our feedback and we did point out the shortcomings. \n\nI wouldn't mind going to Kolachi again for its serene and magical surroundings.

Most of them are not local. We ordered Mutton Biryani, Chicken Handi and Lab-e-Shireen from Food Centre and Kunna from Advance Food Centre at Phase 2 (as recommended by some of the hub's friends). For biryani and Kunna, we provided the meat for these 2 dishes. \n\nFood centre guy told us that they will cook 7kg of meat and 5kg of rice for our guests of about 50 people (adults + children), 4kg Chicken Handi and 4kg Lab-e-Shireen. As for Kunna, we ordered a 5kg one.\n\nI am happy to mention here that Food Centre and Advance Food Centre did a really good job. The biryani was so delicious with just the right taste of spices, not too spicy and it just got that \"kick\" when u eat it, everyone was praising it and some even asked me for their contact no. Chicken Handi was a hit too and not forgetting the dessert, which was also whipped up in no time. Kunna was good too though some of them prefer the Kunna they had tried at Chiniot Pakwan.\n\nOverall a great experience ordering from both and most important of all, the guests left with a smile on their faces :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-10-30T11:24:00+0000","updated_time":"2012-10-30T11:25:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzNTIzNjMzOQ\u003d\u003d","before":"MTA5ODQwOTE3MQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"453423278042161","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"Love food centre !!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-10-30T11:25:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDUzNDIzMjc4MDQyMTYx","before":"NDUzNDIzMjc4MDQyMTYx"}}},"restaurantName":"Handi"},{"id":"165861103465048_452363478148141","from":{"name":"Latif Bawany","id":"630206256"},"message":"Had a superb evening out celebrating eid with cousins at Kolachi! excellent food.

With the expectation bar at its peak after hearing and reading so much about it on SWOT and outside, I was a bit apprehensive while going. What if it doesn?t turn out as good? What if my grandiose expectations fall flat? Oh well. Nevermind, I reassured myself and our group of 10 with bachas in it went ahead. We reached well after 830pm thanks to the jam packed sea view road that tested both my patience and driving skills. Finally when we reached we were told by the courteous lady at the entrance that we?ll have to wait for anywhere between 30 to 40 minutes to get a table for 10. Though I was warned of the weekend rush that picks up after 830pm my own miscalculation prevented me from pre-booking. Thanks to Muneer Esmail and the ever courteous staff of Kolachi, we managed to get a table well before the time given. And what a lovely spot it was. I could?ve easily spent hours sitting up on the deck overlooking the sea and enjoying the lovely environs. Kolachi cleared its first test with full marks! \n\nThe gentleman who appeared to be the Manager helped us settle and ensured we were comfortable. Our group relied on me to order (knowing fully well that I am the worst at the job). However, thanks to my earlier post on SWOT, I had received some recommendations and decided to play safe. So my pick included Paneer Reshmi Handi, Peshawari Karhai (in Chicken as the group was not inclined towards red meat) and Kolachi Reshmi Kabab. As much as we wanted to try out starters, we chose not too as the popcorns at Cineplex right before the journey to Kolachi didn?t allow that. So we settled on the main course. For this trip only! \n\nBachas in our group are notorious for ordering fries wherever they go! They frown and fret and make a fuss if they don?t find their favorite starter. Fortunately Kolachi didn?t let us down there! Kids were happy with cheesy and Masala fries to start off their meal. For drinks, I went ahead with Muneer?s recommendation and ordered Blue Colada. Some in the group ordered Lemon Mint Glacier while the rest settled for soft drinks or fresh lime. \n\nFood at Kolachi came, saw and conquered! Literally! Paneer Reshmi Handi was well beyond our expectations. It was simply divine! I profusely thanked SWOTTIES who recommended it!! I wanted to devour more than my appetite allowed. And I did. Peshawari Karhai was well cooked and tasted heavenly. With roghni naan, the food was sheer delight. Reshmi Kababs were fresh and tender. They complemented well. \n\nI am forever thankful to Muneer for recommending Blue Colada! It was fantastic. I acted the bad one by not sharing it with anybody which I usually do. The evil me had it all and craved for more!! However I didn?t want to explode so resisted. There was no space left for even tea. So we got up after the lovely food and an excellent service. I must compliment the staff. I wonder how they remain so polite and attentive given the number of people frequenting the place and demanding personalized service! Hats off to the management of Kolachi. \n\nNeedless to say Kolachi is on my radar now and I?ll be visiting the place more often!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-16T06:26:33+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-16T19:42:33+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"688336352","name":"Abbas Farid"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI1OTY4OTUz","before":"NTI0NDc2NzM1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"413375985380224","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Yum!!

I was overjoyed with forty4, cafe subhani and china kitchen, which was expected from the reviews. But extremely disappointed by BOTS and TUC. The fried prawns felt like I was chewing the rubber that comes out of a glue gun. I couldn't even taste the actual fish covered by the thick carpet of bitter coating. The biryanee was so over spiced, it literally burnt my taste buds. And the food wasn't cheap for a roadside dhaabaa. Infact it was an insult to our cuisine. I like to support small restaurants too. But only the passionate ones that care about food. Not ones that literally kill the taste of seafood with their overzealous cooking using overused oil. I know it feels good knowing the owner and having him reply here and all. But gimme a break.

Golden Dragon - My new love for Thai and Chinese food. Hot favourites: American Chopsuey, Crispy Beef, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Hot and Sour Soup, Thai Soup, Thai Green Curry, Wontons, Zingers and Chicken Karhai (the last two from their Lunch Xpress section)\n\n2. Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb's warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I'm not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away. Will go soon to be blown away by other things too.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-25T18:59:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-27T14:47:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"505164013","name":"Yasmeen Agad-Kothawala"},{"id":"515396294","name":"Danish Ali Dahraj"},{"id":"100003249618202","name":"Heer Ahmed"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"500907007","name":"Murtaza Moiz"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNjUxNzIy","before":"NjU3MDMxNzQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"404073356310487","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"i see myself featured here too, obliged and humbled Hajra Amir","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T19:33:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir","type":"user","offset":52,"length":10}]},{"id":"404123489638807","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Thank you Hajra :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T21:13:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra","type":"user","offset":10,"length":5}]},{"id":"404386042945885","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"These places are on my fingertips 24/7!!!

Ambiance was nice, a serene enviroment welcomes you on arrival. Unlike other places on that strip its not overcrowded despite having a crowded look on the outside. Seating arrangement is spacious and comfortable, with sofa's and chairs at three different levels. They have a upper deck, a middle level, a lower deck and a sheesha lounge, the middle two being right on the ocean and one can actually feel the tide come and hit the rocks below coupled will the flood lights on the sea which creates an enchanting effect.Coming to the service aspect both the staff and servers are more like programmed robots and need to be more vigilant to the diners needs, they keep sauntering around the place but to get hold of them is a tough task. A bottle of water took 15-20 minutes to arrive, its seemed like they were manufacturing it, drinks arrived ten minutes after dinner was served and I had to remind them, coordination is lacking and staff was not properly trained in this aspect. Ordered their Charcoal Combo platter, which was fresh and crisp comprising of batter fried mushrooms, chicken wings and fried chicken with mozzarella cheese accompanied with two yummy dips, also had the Beef Cheese Burger and Chicken Fajita Burger both well done, were well flavored, succulent pieces of grilled chicken breast and had a spicy tinge, but the bread was not as it should be, a bit soggy and quality of the bun could be improved, fries could be more crisp. For desert had Blueberry Cheese Cake was very good, light and fluffy with a biscuit crust, really melted in the mouth, a generous helping for two to three weight watchers. Overall experience was good, a place which stands out from the crowd and has an air of sophistication, recommended for foreign guests who may have the impression that Karachi is a city under siege or civil war, taking them to this places will showcase the soft face of Karachi and the beauty of the sea. They just need to work a tad bit more on their service.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-24T11:24:45+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-24T15:29:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"741265709","name":"Sarah Hasnat"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQxMjY1NzA5","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"403364046381418","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Try Kolachi next time.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T15:11:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403370973047392","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Kolachi is the next target...what do u recommend?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T15:27:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403372099713946","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Hunzai Handi.

And then I hear mostly good reviews about the same place. And when I do try the place, the positive vibes have been proved correct. Kolachi and Tutti Frutti are the 2 places in subject here. \n\nHad the chocolate and the original flavor and I am at a loss for words. This was the most amazing willy-wonka-ish experience since Funland. I felt like a kid in Disneyland. The froyo is yummy, the place is oozing with colors, smiles, flavor and so much positivity. I was delighted! The delegate was in a rush so we couldnt wait for the toppings (sad) but they looked yum. But anyways the fro-yo was to-die-for. No after taste, the original was tangy..just enough tangy.....and the chocolate was a little like dark chocolate...and mixed together it was heaven. Oh yeah and it had the best consistency right till the last lick. And yes priced beautifully. P.S - No receipts. But oh well.\n\nKolachi. Man. Charcoal's ambiance has taken a back seat in my books. WHAT a place, tastefully done, EXCELLENT sofas and seating, Kolachi is a must-visit. Now for the food, FINALLY  a place on phase 8 that is a complete package! Food AND ambiance! Had the Hunzai Handi. OMG. It was divine. The right balance of spice and gravy with soft tender pieces of chicken that melts in your mouth, this is a must have. The bihari boti and paratha were nothing to write home about as I have had better. Honestly, these two items were Charcoal's standard. Bland. But that handi and oh yes! the prawn starter totally nailed it! The prices are steep - 1 starter, 1 handi and 1 plate bihari kebab, 2 nans and 1 paratha, 1 large water bottle and 1 drink Rs. 2180. Steep as the quantity was exactly for 2 people (nothing was left over) which means that it is expensive and less quantity (1000 per head) Having said that, if you have plans for phase 8, this is where u wanna go.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-31T19:45:34+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-01T09:26:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"828190023","name":"Shaheen Nouman"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQxNDk1NjI1","before":"ODI4MTkwMDIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"389951377722685","from":{"name":"Lubna Ashraf Jafri","id":"501447368"},"message":"Wow, sounds like someone had a great experience at both the places and is satiated :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-31T22:23:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"389951684389321","from":{"name":"Lubna Ashraf Jafri","id":"501447368"},"message":"I love both TF and Kolachi too :)\nTF gotta be my favorite place for froyo these days!

And i like mine well done so i made sure to tell him many times that it HAS to be well done, and thankfully it was. Juicy, flavorful and well done. My steak was just great. Loved the ambience, the food and even the music. I found their music collection to be quite up to date and nice. A combination of latest english, hindi AND pakistani tracks. As you can tell, i really did like their taste in music! Haha its just that its a rare thing to happen.

White Karhai was not up-to the mark, it was dry with very little spice, but Chicken boneless Handi was amazing. Divine taste. Ambiance was as usual perfect. Perfect weather for superhighway.

Highly recommended :))","type":"status","created_time":"2012-02-05T09:28:42+0000","updated_time":"2012-02-05T11:17:13+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"311081215609702","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi : agar hum ajatay around 12 midnight to kuch milta BOTS pay except amjad bhai? :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-05T09:49:03+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":19}]},{"id":"311085252275965","from":{"name":"Danial Rizvi","id":"726690443"},"message":"Shouldve gone, weekends pe to BOTS late tak khula hota hai.
