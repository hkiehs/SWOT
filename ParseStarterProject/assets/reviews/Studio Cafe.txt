Flo to make a reservation for my wife and myself for Valentine?s Day dinner for 9.00pm. The gentleman on the phone said we only have two slots available; 8.00pm and 10.00pm. I confirmed for the 10.00pm slot. He said we will make the temporary reservation but booking will be confirmed once Rs. 3,000 has been paid in advance. I was like fine I will make the payment next week. Today I went to make the payment via my card but they said reservation is to be made by cash payment only and also informed me that only cash payments will be accepted on the day of the dinner. I was like this should have been communicated to me via phone when I was making the reservation or it should be mentioned somewhere (where ever you advertise your deals like karachisnob.com). Eventually I just decided to leave!\nCorrect me if I am wrong but wasn't Flo being cheap? I understand they were trying to get their confirmations by receiving advances from the customers but then at least mode of payment should have been kept flexible! Who carries cash in this day and age! They should bring it to the customer?s knowledge at least. I have always had a great experience at Flo but this incident left me utterly disappointed.

I think I'm in cupcake heaven.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-08-16T16:17:06+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-18T12:36:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003660266586","name":"Mariyam Shahjahan"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"100003640081725","name":"Aiman Khalid"},{"id":"594796590","name":"Ufaq Ashfaque"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"566005153","name":"Mansab Uzair"},{"id":"100001882596023","name":"Mansoor Zaheer"},{"id":"599645349","name":"Hamna Haqqi"},{"id":"1058171190","name":"Fahad-Pakistani Zaidi"},{"id":"100000087775469","name":"Arshad Shamsi"},{"id":"100000234977922","name":"Zain Hasan"},{"id":"512000130","name":"Mustafa Masood"},{"id":"100001432075867","name":"Suhaila Tobeh"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"100000299126508","name":"Ahsan Javed"},{"id":"189100160","name":"Ehtesham Maqbool"},{"id":"100005558611444","name":"Rana Arslan"},{"id":"670615540","name":"Khurram Wahab"},{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan"},{"id":"505484337","name":"Mian Saad"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"518470140","name":"Mustafa Chhotani"},{"id":"669320704","name":"Fahad Azad"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"688651656","name":"Amin Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg4NjUxNjU2","before":"MTAwMDAzNjYwMjY2NTg2"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_604088056309015/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjg4NjUxNjU2"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"604090789642075","from":{"name":"DrSyed Farrukh Jamal","id":"749655321"},"message":"Whers this Pane & Amore ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:26:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"604091912975296","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Ure lucky u got them....they usually run out of em...but werent they divine??","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:30:09+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"604093022975185","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Behind pink Cadillac.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:34:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"604093089641845","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"And omg Soha they were out of the world","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:34:46+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"604094196308401","from":{"name":"Shakeeb Ahmed","id":"516818488"},"message":"Suhaila Tobeh Fahad Hussain","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:38:28+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100001432075867","name":"Suhaila Tobeh","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13},{"id":"501632029","name":"Fahad Hussain","type":"user","offset":14,"length":13}]},{"id":"604094876308333","from":{"name":"Adnan Afzal","id":"100002014163412"},"message":"How much do they cost Ayesha?

Flo to make a reservation for my wife and myself for Valentine?s Day dinner for 9.00pm. The gentleman on the phone said we only have two slots available; 8.00pm and 10.00pm. I confirmed for the 10.00pm slot. He said we will make the temporary reservation but booking will be confirmed once Rs. 3,000 has been paid in advance. I was like fine I will make the payment next week. Today I went to make the payment via my card but they said reservation is to be made by cash payment only and also informed me that only cash payments will be accepted on the day of the dinner. I was like this should have been communicated to me via phone when I was making the reservation or it should be mentioned somewhere (where ever you advertise your deals like karachisnob.com). Eventually I just decided to leave!\nCorrect me if I am wrong but wasn't Flo being cheap? I understand they were trying to get their confirmations by receiving advances from the customers but then at least mode of payment should have been kept flexible! Who carries cash in this day and age! They should bring it to the customer?s knowledge at least. I have always had a great experience at Flo but this incident left me utterly disappointed. Lesson to all the restaurant owners: PLEASE MAKE ALL SORT OF COMMUNICATION TO THE CUSTOMERS (BE IT RELATED TO DEALS, PAYMENT ETC.) VERY CRISP AND CLEAR.

My friend really liked the Spicy Chicken Sandwich, as did I :) We both enjoyed our Caramel Coffee/Caramel Belgian Chocolate Coffee and ended with a Chocolate Mint Cup Cake. If you like after eights, then this cup cake is for you. Loved the fact that the cup cake was soft and freshly baked. \n\nOh and definitely loved the cool interior...loved the details. Very nicely done.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-17T13:44:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-18T13:51:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"780381887","name":"Samar Husain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzgwMzgxODg3","before":"NzgwMzgxODg3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"298070063577484","from":{"name":"Erum Zehra","id":"100001677628921"},"message":"Yup loved the caramel coffee, sandwich was good, fries were not so good, and cup cake was very fresh","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-17T14:15:03+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"298122773572213","from":{"name":"Erum Munir","id":"716107068"},"message":"Spicy Chicken Sandwich*","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-17T15:43:41+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"298125906905233","from":{"name":"Fazal Gafur","id":"677666360"},"message":"yummy yummy ....
