Flo to make a reservation for my wife and myself for Valentine?s Day dinner for 9.00pm. The gentleman on the phone said we only have two slots available; 8.00pm and 10.00pm. I confirmed for the 10.00pm slot. He said we will make the temporary reservation but booking will be confirmed once Rs. 3,000 has been paid in advance. I was like fine I will make the payment next week. Today I went to make the payment via my card but they said reservation is to be made by cash payment only and also informed me that only cash payments will be accepted on the day of the dinner. I was like this should have been communicated to me via phone when I was making the reservation or it should be mentioned somewhere (where ever you advertise your deals like karachisnob.com). Eventually I just decided to leave!\nCorrect me if I am wrong but wasn't Flo being cheap? I understand they were trying to get their confirmations by receiving advances from the customers but then at least mode of payment should have been kept flexible! Who carries cash in this day and age! They should bring it to the customer?s knowledge at least. I have always had a great experience at Flo but this incident left me utterly disappointed.
