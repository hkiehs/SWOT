It is highly over-rated.. And the pictures on their menu board are most deceiving. \n\n- We asked for a mixed berry parfait and the only thing it had was granola and oats, the berries were in the form of a sugar fruit syrup with the seeds unlike how it shows on the menu board with the strawberry slices, raspberries and stuff. \n\n- Secondly, the waffles were dry like eating plastic. Pre-packed and heated in the microwave. And who serves Cream Cheese with chocolate waffles? I mean it was so dry we had to put the frozen yogurt from the parfait on the waffle and eat it to give it some taste! \n\n- Lastly, with reference to the image of the smoothie below, we got something which we were wondering is it even ours? Like.. Why do u put up pics of such tempting looking smoothies and serve it up like an epic fail substance. Thank God we didn't order the panini cuz it just looked sad and depressed at the counter waiting to die. \n\nSo basically, if you like Fro-yo, just have a cup of your favourite flavour and do not risk trying anything else.

Unfortunately, we did not meet your ?or our own ? expectations. \n\nWe would like to go through your complaint point by point:\n\n1) We have immediately ordered for a change of pictures and renaming of our Mix Berry Parfait to 'Mix Berry Compote Parfait' at both our outlets.  The change should be in effect within the next two days. \n\nWe use fresh strawberries whenever they are in season, however in off-season we import high-quality French frozen berries for use in our mixed-berry parfait. Since frozen berries can be hard on the gums, we make a 'compote' out of the frozen berries for ease of consumption.\n\n2) It is company policy that all our waffles are prepared on order using our waffle irons. Red Mango does not pre-prepare or microwave any of its waffles. It is also company policy for each waffle to be served with a side of yogurt cream cheese and canadian maple syrup.  \n\nYour post suggests that you were not served maple syrup with your order of waffles, and we are extremely sorry for this.\n\n3) The menu picture you have posted is of a spoonable smoothie,whereas the item that you were       served is a fresh fruit smoothie. It appears that you were served an incorrect item. Again, we are extremely sorry for this miscommunication. \n\nBecause of these oversights, we would like to invite you to our either of our stores to avail each of the three above items free of charge.\n\nWe deeply value your relationship with Red Mango and are committed to providing you with the highest level of service because our customers deserve the very best. \n\nWe hope to see you at Red Mango soon, and would like to apologize once again for your sub-standard experience.\n\nYours in service,\n\nThe Red Mango Team","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-30T13:49:46+0000","like_count":10,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"504776217","name":"Rahila Najaf Nizam","type":"user","offset":0,"length":18}]},{"id":"674814592569694","from":{"name":"Ashnaa F Khan","id":"650649934"},"message":"^ Awesome customer feedback response! :like:","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-30T17:27:40+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"675075115876975","from":{"name":"Rahila Najaf Nizam","id":"504776217"},"message":"Red, thank you for your warm and re-affirming message.

For months I had heard great reviews of the kind of treats that came out of the kitchen of Fatso?s; being a big supporter of startups as well as sucker for desserts, I decided to give Fatsos a try. I was also constantly being told that the owner of this sensational catering company; was an alum of Le cordon bleu, and hence, she was fully versed in her ingredients and baking skills. So one fine day I finally went on the Fatso?s facebook page and went through the menu list. The one dessert that caught my eye was the Mango, Dark Chocolate & Cinnamon Cake with Mango whipped cream and Bourbon Vanilla bean.(I?ll be honest the Bourbon Vanilla impressed this jutt) The picture that was posted was a beautiful designed Mango cake that had mango pieces cut to perfection and placed-oh so gently on top of the cake. The picture alone made my mouth salivate, and without another thought I messaged the owner of Fatso?s. When asking the owner how much the cake would cost she said Rs.3000. A little hesitant I became from the price-but then as a true foody (self proclaimed) I understood that I was paying for the expensive ingredients and a 360 degree experience on my pallet. So there was nothing left for me to do, and so I placed my order for an Rs.3000 Mango cake. A few days later I had to pick up my order, unfortunately, I was stuck at work and made the mistake of telling my fianc?e to pick it up instead. When he asked me how much he had to pay Fatso?s, I told him the price, and for that, he very calmly stated that all my financial decisions makings after marriage would be revoked, as we do not own oil fields.(just a reminder in case i hadn?t gotten the memo). I told him the return of investment would be worth every penny, and that he was too cheap to understand that the cake was being crafted by a true pastry artisan.  \nThe next day I had gone over to my fianc?es with my sister to have cake and chai. My first reaction when I saw the cake was an underwhelmed one- just by the presentation, the cake was like any ordinary round cake with yellow frosting. The topping of the mangos were not cut beautifully as the picture, instead, the mango was cut in long strips and looked like mango worms, an extremely careless job and def not of a professional. Yet, my optimistic self said let?s not judge the book by its cover. So now it was time to try the Rs.3000 investment?the experience? forgettable (even for this jutt). There was no sign of cinnamon or bourbon vanilla bean taste, the frosting tasted like kaybees mango ice cream but in the form of frosting. The chocolate cake I must admit was nice and moist and definitely had a good chocolate flavor (but so does Betty Crocker chocolate cake mix for the price of Rs.350). The 360 degrees experience was limited to a mere 65 degrees. By the end of cake tasting I willing gave up my rights of my financial decision making?(a little experience note)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-29T07:36:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-29T14:10:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"607771212","name":"Maira Ahsan"},{"id":"514292991","name":"Marium Hosein"},{"id":"521420389","name":"Syed Jami Amin"},{"id":"786471893","name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed"},{"id":"675866757","name":"Vijanti Perwani"},{"id":"1807053822","name":"Sahrish Naseer"},{"id":"857175366","name":"Usama Qureshi"},{"id":"1088748635","name":"Aqsa Shah"},{"id":"539145384","name":"Saher Shaikh"},{"id":"504398246","name":"Uzma Arij Bilgrami"},{"id":"504654956","name":"Hiba Ali Raza"},{"id":"546160156","name":"Kahkashan Hassan"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"503086792","name":"Mehreen Rohan Shoaib"},{"id":"515193342","name":"Mesam Akhter"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Pasting it here for food businesses to see.  -----------   I figured out why Apple is what it is yesterday and reinforced my love for the brand and why legacy of Steve Jobs continues! My 6 year old daughter by mistake shopped for some virtual coins thru an application worth $1000. And with just one email, they reverted in less than 5 mins and confirmed reimbursement. And the message that I got from Apple representative was even more amazing: 'Thank you for your kind words. I'm so glad to hear that your issue with the accidental purchases is resolved. Actually I should be the one to thank you. I know that this is inconvenience on your part, but you have been very kind, patient and cooperative. Nothing makes Apple happier than to hear that we have pleased our customers'. And that's a real wow experince!!! Imagine the support system, processes and authority that they provide to their team to resolve such millions of issues in minutes.--------      My key takeout here is providing processes and authority/decision making power to your teams (restaurant managers/waiters/call centre ppl) to make decisions and ensure customer satisfaction. When you tell a customer you'll get back to them, you're giving him a window of a few hours/days to go and whine about his bad experience. Many times, managers lack the confidence to make an on-spot decision. At smaller eateries, if the guy gets your order wrong, he gives u the typical sob story \"meri tankha mein se kaat lein gai\", so u feel bad for the guy and end up eating something u didnt really feel like. While alot of restaurants have implemented this practice, others who haven't should look into it.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-17T04:24:39+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-17T08:14:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"626900866","name":"Shahzad Qureshi"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"646650712","name":"Ambreen Dossa"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ2NjUwNzEy","before":"NjI2OTAwODY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"425011957549960","from":{"name":"Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi","id":"684515056"},"message":"Henna Javed :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-17T05:38:30+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1539480697","name":"Henna Javed","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"425012480883241","from":{"name":"Henna","id":"1539480697"},"message":"Awesome anecdote.

Ummm...how would I know it's rotten if I hadn't drank from it? And what - did they mean to re-serve it to someone else if I hadn't drank from it then returned it?! Anyway the waiter argued with me for 10 minutes and then i called the manager. Same retarded reply from HIM...another 20 minute argument. All over a cold coffee!!! I insisted i would not be paying for the cold coffee but my family dislikes confrontation and my brother quietly told the waiter he would pay for it. That annoyed me too :@ and all this time, they didn't even offer me a replacement drink like water...i was thirsty til the end of the meal. \nAfter this, i asked the first floor manager for owner details...i was given a comment sheet which i filled out and put my complaint and contact details but i guess nobody ever looked at it BC i was never contacted.

The place is better organized, visited the new lounge but the ac's were out of order and secondly they offered a different menu from the arabic one inside so consensus was to sit outdoors. We sat in comfortable khema (tent) with farshi seating, cushions and an effective fan. Ordered Furrouge grill Full, Special Shahwarma platter, Chicken Shahwarma, Hummus n Peeta bread, waiters were sparse and shaky, seemed confused and in a hurry, asked three times what we wanted, were told order will take 15-20 atleast, after half and hour i inquired, they said another 10 min, again asked, they said ten minutes, food arrived after nearly an hour, was totally famished, has to reprimand the supervisor Javed who was most apologetic, the food was very very good or we were very hungry, but the servers were not in control. One guy said \"sir aaj rush bhuth heay\" the other guy said that they are understaffed etc. If only these people can improve their level of service a bit the food and the environment is different and very nice n relaxing to spend an evening.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-09T21:00:44+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-11T12:37:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"410974015620421","from":{"name":"Umtus Sanna Hussain-Mirza","id":"528525436"},"message":"i went there once too and they took an hour to serve us!no jokes!never went back again!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-09T21:32:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"411556628895493","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"I was pleasantly suprised to receive a reply from Arabian Nights which is reproduced as follows:- Mr.Azam First we would like to say thanks to you for your appreciation and secondly for your feed back ...we understand your inconvenient, and we appologise for that .Arabian Nights is constantly working to improve the service and quality we take your feedback positively and we assure you we will take action on it and prove you with best service and quality in the future.\nPlease always share your feedback with us it will help us to serve you better.\nThanks","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-11T12:34:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"411557665562056","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Kudos to Arabian Nights, if you seriously work on your HRM you have a fine place.

Ambiance, I don't really care much for. \n\n1) BOTS: With over 200 dishes. It caters to my Chinese, Seafood, Bbq fixes all under ONE roof, What more can one ask for? \n2) GHAFFAR KABAB HOUSE: One place a food lover can never leave dissapointed. \n3) HARDEES: If I could eat one thing all day everyday. It would be a GREAT beef n cheese burger. And for me the Hardees Superstar is the best Beef Cheese karachi has to offer. As good as it is, the other burgers are equally as bad. \n4) XANDERS: Fried Calamari, Clasic Beef Cheese Burger & New York Cheese Cake 'nuff said. \n5) JAVED NIHARI: Regular Swotties know me for being a desi food fanatic. And it doesn't get any desier than Javed Nihari. Best Nihari in Karachi.  \n6) AGHA SAJJI HOUSE : This is just for my katakat fix. Beats all katakat places I've ever had. And I've had katakat at more than a dozen places atleast. \n7) DONISL : My second favorite Kakakat joint, used to be my first. Quality has gone down. \n8) CAFE BLUE GINGER: Beef In Oyster Sauce. FTW!!\n9) MADNI BIRYANI: My favorite biryani. Sometimes consistency issues, but still the best biryani which has top quality chawal unlike others. \n10) KUNDAN BROAST: With a different broast waala on every street corner, standing out takes hard work. And stand out, Kundan does. \n\nNotable Mentions : \nTUC : RVC\nCakery: Cheesecakes, Cheesecakes and Cheesecakes\nChips: Beef Cheese. \nKarachi Broast: Love their Dry shashlik with the special hot sauce.\nBADAL PAN SHOP: For a must Raja Sahab after dining out experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-30T05:43:03+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-30T10:59:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"581895987","name":"Emane Haque"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"531710313","name":"Aly Raza"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE5MjM1ODcz","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"388889521162204","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"Badal Pan Shop? the one on five star chowrangi? behind babulilm?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-30T06:41:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"388891964495293","from":{"name":"Danial Rizvi","id":"726690443"},"message":"Yeah","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-30T06:46:46+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"388921331159023","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"sdcr: ghaffar is my all time favour and so is agha sajji house.

I havent had nihari at Javed's so I cannot comment on that. \n\nWhile we are on the topic, do try the fried kababs and the qorma at Cafe Hassan with tandoor fresh be-chheetay-ki-sheermal (sheermal that hasnt been sprayed with water after baking). They are awesome. \n\nFinally, the directions to Cafe Hassan are quite simple.If you are going from Clifton or M.A.Jinnah Road, go past Civil Hospital, and turn left towards Lady Dufferin Hospital. Continue  straight past Lady Dufferin and past the Lighthouse flea market crossing, and about 500  yards down the road, you will see Cafe Hassan on your right.

However its been observed that many of these complains barring a very few are dealt with properly and promptly at the restaurant level already. Same complains if handled already when resurface here lead people to believe that we haven?t responded and that?s a tad unfair as we have done our bit to handle the issue and it doesn?t make for constructive feedback.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-16T10:22:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100000391823197","name":"Farah S.
