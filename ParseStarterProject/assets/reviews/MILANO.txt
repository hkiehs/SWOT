They said it was enough for two people *seriously I devoured the whole thing myself without even taking a break* what two people!! *burp*\n\nExcuse me..\n\nComing to the pizza now. Well the pizza was like love at first sight. Exciting in the start but slowly lost its charm, so I had to break up.\n\nWhen I first opened the box, it looked delightful, hot, steamy, perfect amount of cheese, meat and veggies.\nTook the first bite was soft and creamy, good taste. Was loaded with cheese but it was more of the creamy cheap cheese and not the good one. I can compare this to a very good bakery pizza but nothing high end or fancy about it.\nReminds me of the pizza at Carlton. Or Milano.ppp\n\nBut after the second slice the excitement died. The flavours sort of blended into the spice and cheese. And it became oddly hard and chewy. By the 5th slice it was painful to chew so I had to reheat it.\n\nOverall.\nIt's good enough if you can manage.to eat the whole thing while hot. \nPriced at 500 for a regular il give it a 6/10 for value for money. Considering it claims to satisfy two and that wasn't the case.\nTaste I will give it a 6 also.\nPoints for timely delivery though.\n\nWill I order again. Nope probably not, I would reccomend Milano's pizza over this.\n\nWas and play experience, not to bad n not to good.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-06T17:52:10+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-07T08:58:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000754100582","name":"Zohaib Ibrahim Palijo"},{"id":"832750315","name":"Romano Karim Yusuf"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"568465423","name":"Yasir Hasan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"565262130","name":"Sharjeel Ahmed Khan"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"515247766","name":"Ali Murtaza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE1MjQ3NzY2","before":"MTAwMDAwNzU0MTAwNTgy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"662752577109229","from":{"name":"Adnan Afzal","id":"100002014163412"},"message":"Ok.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-06T17:57:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"662753250442495","from":{"name":"Ahmareen Bari","id":"756940336"},"message":"I only order their boneless Chicken Makhni Haandi.I think every food joint is good for only one or two dishes!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-06T17:59:50+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"662753903775763","from":{"name":"Faris Khan","id":"1316713144"},"message":"and now you need to drink a lot of green tea (y) aids digestion haha","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-06T18:01:57+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"662755413775612","from":{"name":"Ali Murtaza","id":"515247766"},"message":"so can we expect a cake review of Ginoginelles tom ??? :P :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-06T18:07:19+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"662756727108814","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Oh please no.

So, for 3 people, we ordered the following:\n\n* Chicken Corn Soup (I know, not many people order the classic Chicken Corn Soup, neither do we, but mother just insisted) - We ordered the large serving of the soup, and it was exactly 3 bowls of soup. No more, no less. Yes it was stated already in the menu that it serves 2-3 people, but the Ginsoy - Extreme Chinese fan in us thought there'd be more. Not at all a disappointment though, by any means. It was exactly what Chicken Corn Soup needs to be. Small little bits, but sufficient, of chicken, adequate amount of corn. The soup was just what it was supposed to be.\n\n* Wasabi Prawns for appetizers - The prawns were remarkably done. They had that wasabi-kick in them which was needed to give that \"buzz\" feel you want to have when eating a Wasabi Prawn. Yet again, there were 5 prawns in total, dot. Tastewise: Brilliant.\n\n* Fish Milano (my main) - Their Fish Milano was intended to be  a large fried fillet of fish placed delicately over a bed of green-herbs sauce and coated with cheese served with rice (as understood from the menu). It was exactly as described. I needed something cheesy and rich, and it definitely delivered. The fish was nicely done; flaky, properly fried, the type that just wants you to keep eating it. The green sauce under the fish was generous in quantity, but didn't quite have much of a \"burst of flavors\" that I was hoping for. But the cheese on top took care of that. All in all, a 7/10\n\n* Fish with Jalapeno *something*, mum's main (apologies for not remembering the complete name) - A similar sized fish to mine, fried as nicely as mine was, sat on the plate with sauteed vegetables, a serving of rice, and a small little bowl/cup containing the sauce for this dish. This sauce however, did have a distinctive taste to it. I actually borrowed some of it to use on my fish as well. The one thing common in the 2 mains was that the steamed rice that were served with them were simply the best ever steamed rice I've ever had in my life. The rice had an amazing feel to them in the mouth that is probably inexplicable, yet noticeable. An 7.5/10\n\n* Black Pepper Chicken and Garlic Rice, sold separately (father's main) - Hands down, the highlight of the day. Never have I tasted Black Pepper Chicken done so beautifully crafted in terms of flavor. And the Garlic Rice were \"actually\" Garlic Rice, not a joke in the name of garlic. You could just bring the bowl of rice close to your nostrils and know for a fact how nicely the garlic was incorporated in the rice. Father won, simple. Would definitely give 8.5/10\n\nWe ordered 3 drinks to go with the meal: Mint Julep, Blue Margarita, Peach *something*. In terms of the quantity of the drinks, father (Mint Julep) won again. Then mum (Peach *something) and then me. Again.\nThe experience, in terms of cozy sitting, soothing music being played in the background (rather than some pop/rap/hip-hop artist blaring) and most importantly, taste, was great. Definitely a place I'd go over and over again.\nThe only problem that I have is that the portions could be slightly bigger, because when you pay about Rs. 5000 for a meal of 3, you sort-of expect to be filled to the hilt. But it wasn't so. But it was 5000 bucks well-spent for taste. Definitely well-spent if \"taste\" was (and mostly, it is) meant to be the star. I would just say, if they could slightly beef up their quantity too, it'll do wonders.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-12T03:34:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-12T20:01:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1352533620","name":"Sakina Nanabhai"},{"id":"1088748635","name":"Aqsa Shah"},{"id":"1241948621","name":"Nayab Shakil"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"100002608457065","name":"Haroona Khawar"},{"id":"100001249191882","name":"Fozia Amjad"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"628495513","name":"Fariha Harris"},{"id":"617371190","name":"Samar Mughal"},{"id":"100001697508377","name":"Hira Qazi"},{"id":"550700453","name":"Ammar Amjad"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1202678003","name":"Aisha Naayaab Rao"},{"id":"614747510","name":"Tariq Hameed Siddiqui"},{"id":"100001419761223","name":"Imran Malik"},{"id":"756768261","name":"Muhammad Aslam"},{"id":"535065551","name":"Hassan Khan"},{"id":"789225723","name":"Lalarukh Khursheed Farooqui"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM4MjM2MTI1Ng\u003d\u003d","before":"NTA4OTIyNTA5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"648625911855229","from":{"name":"Sajjad Ahmed","id":"1382361256"},"message":"well described!thanks....but 5000 rupees too much!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-12T04:35:05+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"648630128521474","from":{"name":"Ehtesham Maqbool","id":"189100160"},"message":"Nice detailed review.

Its just amazing how Mr Big with Egg n Cheese is perfect every time . It feels like they have time frozen the entire process for the last 20 years . Succulent , Flavoursome , Juicy Satisfaction all wrapped up in One little Piece of Heaven. I'd rate it 12/10 , 2 extra points for that smile on my face every time I take the first bite.\n\n2- Al Asif Square : Though a bit risky for some fellows but to be honest the place was packed . We had food at MADINA RESTAURANT which is located inside Al Asif Square and to some people's surprise there were few families around there as well ( well to do families at that ) enjoying food , the atmosphere was friendly we were greeted as warmly as always . We had the famous Dumba Boti , Afghani Pulao , Namkeen Gosht and Karahi.  Now i don't want to waste time in describing the brilliance of food . \nThat is the best Authentic Afghani food out there, Period , 11/10 . One extra point for the Afghan brethren for their every gracious hospitality. \n\n3- Tayyabi Restaurant : Located in Hussainabad. It one of the few unsung heroes of Karachi. We ordered Prawn Masala , KataKat , Chicken Chargha Fry, Malai Boti and Tikkas . Food was served a bit late as they prepare all the dishes fresh and from the scratch. \nPrawn Masala is one of the best in town as the prawns just melt in your mouth and mix with that zesty masala . THE DAMN ! \n\nKatakat and Chicken Chargha fry are good too . All in all yet another place you wont come out unsatisfied or cheated, EVER . 8/10 . -2 for the stolen side mirror of my friend's car from the parking :P\n\n4-  The Burger Shack: I have Shake Shack every week so it did not impressed me much. But i'd like to commend the owner for doing the best damn possible thing by cloning a famous international franchise's menu and making it possible to offer taste in it as well. I was not disappointed to say the least. 7/10\n\n5- Cafeela : Simply put , Zahoor bhai you rock . Okra Jalfarezi , Malai Boti , Nathiya Gali Qeema , Shahi Tukray , Chicken Yakhni Pulao are all yum. One of the best value for money in town. \n\nI am a safe eater and a Desi at heart as I get to eat really yummy mum cooked food and these are few of the places I go to eat or get food delivered when I want to eat out. Flying out tonight . Will Miss Karachi as I always do .

One 13 inch drip cheese thin crust, half pepperoni and half tex mex, along with 8 sides of cheesy breads. \n\nPizza arrived within 30 mins as promised around 1:50 but wasnt quite what I expected, or should I say wasn't quite what they promised previously when they called me up-_- ..\n\nFirstly they messed up my order of cheesy bread with plain bread sticks, and for a whole box of bread sticks I was given one tiny tub of sauce which is very annoying .. \n\nNow to the pizza, I clearly asked for drip cheese and as usual there was a serious lack of cheese on my pizza forget the drip cheese part at all. The tex mex side was good enough but the beef pepperoni made me very sad. Not at all what I was expecting.\nAnd the thin crust felt like biscuit.\nLack of napkins, sauces and, no garlic powder ..\n\nSeriously not ordering from them again esp for delivery.. \n\nSuggestions for other good pizza joints ?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-03T14:24:19+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-05T17:10:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"686720963","name":"Umar Asad"},{"id":"1359766063","name":"Faaz Shabbir"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"100001882596023","name":"Mansoor Zaheer"},{"id":"763705199","name":"Natasha Matin"},{"id":"505484337","name":"Mian Saad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA1NDg0MzM3","before":"Njg2NzIwOTYz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"597547806963040","from":{"name":"Karim Zindani","id":"844105103"},"message":"Pizza One","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-03T14:40:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597549413629546","from":{"name":"Sadiq Kamdar","id":"615046216"},"message":"Try 14th Street Pizza Co. they have never disappointed me !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-03T14:45:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"164703146884428","name":"14th Street Pizza Co.","type":"page","offset":4,"length":21}]},{"id":"597549423629545","from":{"name":"Waleed Muhammad","id":"629361797"},"message":"California Pizza.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-03T14:45:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597549626962858","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"14street is either always too less or too much for me lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-03T14:46:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597549776962843","from":{"name":"Sadiq Kamdar","id":"615046216"},"message":"Dang then its your hard luck when it comes to pizza :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-03T14:46:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597550173629470","from":{"name":"Sadiq Kamdar","id":"615046216"},"message":"Go for the Old school Pizza Hut !!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-03T14:47:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597550180296136","from":{"name":"Sahar Saeed","id":"506285932"},"message":"Milano?

When it comes to judging the best pizza in town, I would suggest it being split between the best thin crust and the best normal/thick crust as the taste of both of these are very different. \n\nAs far as thin crusts are concerned, my favorites in KHI are as follows:\n\nMargarita (plain cheese) - Pompei followed by Bella Vita\nPepperoni and the works - Xanders \n\nThick / normal crust - Ginoginelles Milano with pineapple\n\nWhen I was a kid in the 1990s there was one amazing pizza place in boat basin called JACANA's PIZZA where the current Nihari Inn is now located. They had really good pizza along with the home delivery company called Mamma Mia. Again this post is my personal opinion..just fyi :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T14:32:36+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549384901779331","from":{"name":"Mulghalar Hassan","id":"512578341"},"message":"dine in xanders delivery pizzo","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T14:54:42+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549872535063901","from":{"name":"Saba Ahsan Ali","id":"654018125"},"message":"So what did u finally end up having and how was it?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-29T09:07:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"550021711715650","from":{"name":"Shiraz Qureshi","id":"574028031"},"message":"xanders serves kick ass pizza","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-29T14:13:28+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"550032731714548","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"pizza pie at port grand.. the rooftop.. its pizza with an amazing view...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-29T14:44:20+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"550123198372168","from":{"name":"Behramjee Ghadially","id":"506077064"},"message":"^I've tried pizza at this restaurant...rated C","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-29T15:57:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"550124305038724","from":{"name":"Mariam Salman","id":"633700975"},"message":"Ended up making my own pizza :) thanks guys.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-29T16:01:38+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"550125141705307","from":{"name":"Salik Sajid","id":"512577683"},"message":"pizzo for delivery, pantry n xanders fr dine in","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-29T16:04:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"550128625038292","from":{"name":"Hasan Hanif","id":"551820021"},"message":"Ginoginelles is so underrated.
