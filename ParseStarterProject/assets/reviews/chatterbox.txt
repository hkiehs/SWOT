It's a little bit nuts how much I like it. If you ever visit, you must try their moroccan chicken and chicken with spinach sauce - divine and great pricing too! One night I was craving something from their fabulous kitchen so I placed an order for a Prawn Fettucine Pasta and Chicken Wrap for my mother. I was utterly heartbroken to receive what I did - pasta with no white sauce, instead it was doused in oil. I would have still eaten it without the white sauce but it was impossible to consume with all that oil. My mother's wrap was ridiculously small, it was embarrassing because I'd blindly promoted everything - What could be wrong in the eyes of a fan, right? To top it off, they had put GST charges on\nthe bill. This is where my knowledge might lack a bit, but is that a common practice? Shouldn't they inform the customer when he's ordering? I complained about this to them when I received the bill and they said they would check and get back to me and I never got a call.
