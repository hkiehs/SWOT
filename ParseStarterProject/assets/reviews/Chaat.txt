I was really excited and oh well, i only WAS excited. Went with 2 friends, the place was pretty crowded and we were seated right away at the 1st floor (ambiance: 6/10).Turn off#1. I expected some complimentary bread basket etc but nothing. Found an exciting menu and that further ignited my appetite. Order 3 main courses and 2 drinks. Turn off #2. the waiter insisted to order their special beverages though we kindly refused about 4 times, eventually a shut up call was given. The food arrived within 30mins.\nTurn off#3. The chicken waffles were all about vegetables! Bland sauce, dry chicken, ordinary tarragons have more taste than this (5/10)\nTurn off#4. Burrito bowl, it looked like an absolute delight and all 3 of us attacked but Alas! it was a 'Chana Chaat Pulao' under the lettuce (it was hollow from the bottom). Its was beyond awful! Truly inedible, all the food was neither warm or cold, that was weird!\nTurn off#5. Mushroom Mac & Cheese, another bland dish, the cheese was all stiff from the top, stiff and kinda burnt pepperoni tiny bits, so the serving sizes were really disappointing.\nTurn off#6. The bill amounted to about 3k, since the experience was awful, with dissatisfied tummies,  it was pricey for me to pay 1k per head.\n\nNo offense but it was not my kind of a place. I'd still like to congratulate team pantry for putting in an effort, maybe I had a bad day since so many customers wouldn't have been there if it was that bad.

Mint lemonade served on the table just a few minutes before the Iftaar time.  No shortage of any items in the Iftaar buffet.  Loved the Chicken Wontons and Falafel.  Instead of the all you can eat buffet dinner, Deli gives their guests a selection of starters, mains and desserts to choose from.  The Tangy Mince Chicken Salad was amazing and so were the Stir-Fried Chicken Khowsuey.  I'll give Deli a 10/10 for their Iftaar Deal which is priced at Rs. 899/- plus tax.  Not for those who are looking for 40 dishes in this same amount.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-26T07:17:03+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-26T09:32:13+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"574028031","name":"Shiraz Qureshi"},{"id":"521725594","name":"Amina Mehdi"},{"id":"100001081337199","name":"Ali Saeed"},{"id":"568465423","name":"Yasir Hasan"},{"id":"688715909","name":"Ahmad Owais"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"523286481","name":"Adnan J.

Got 5 portions yesterday, 2 were dropped at a mummy's place (yes, she's also a fan of SF's Khowsuey, she's also recently become a great fan of \"log inn lounge\" restaurant and cafe's Nihari - Najam Quddusi, your Nihari was a big hit with Mummy and she was impressed by the quality of meat used by you which according to her was of the topmost quality) and 3 portions of Khowsuey were for myself, Aalia Mahboob Elahi and Shahzad Saeed.  Noodles were finished last eve and so were the accompanying raw veggies, paapri and the addictive laal chutney.  The curry was good enuff for 6-7 servings so this eve made my own version of SF's leftover Khowsuey.  Boiled a pack of noodles, poured the curry on top of it, added some freshly cut coriander and spring onions.  With no leftover paapri, added some Chill Flavored Kurkure, Tom Yum Kung Flavored Peanuts and Special Chaat Masala that I got from Silver Spoon on my last visit there (yes this is the masala that Silver Spoon sprinkles on their Meethi Puri).  So a whole new flavored Khowsuey this eve that didn't taste like the leftovers from yesterday.  SF you should either increase the quantity of noodles or reduce the quantity of curry by half.  I still have curry left in the fridge to make 2 more portions.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-26T18:01:20+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-28T22:52:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"584411137","name":"Farah Ali"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAxNDE1NzE2","before":"NTg0NDExMTM3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"548225131895308","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Please dont decrease the curryy!!!

Off to Flamingo it was. Finally found the old waiters there, in a different uniform: Al-Rehman Chaat: opened next to Flamingo.\n\nordered Mixed Chaat & Meethi Dahi Puri from Flamingo.\nMasala Dossa and Aloo Masala from Cool-Inn\nAloo Chholay and Bun Kebab from Al-Rehman (the waiters insisted. they did serve us for over 12 years. i had to give it a go)\n\nFlaimngo's mixed chaat: its my favourite. a very good balance of meethi, khatti and hari chutney with dahi. flaws: they use very low amounts of yogurt and given inflationary pressures of prices of channas coupled with their prices people are willing to pay: the chollas are no longer kabuli. as a result they usually tend to be hard at the centre. Ive always had to ask for extra yogurt and then have had to resend it for pouring some more in. but the flavour is still the best i've had of all places. \n\nMasala Dossa: its grown! i guess Mirchi took some clientelle away. and more loaded too this time! i didnt taste much curry leaves this time or mustard seed but it was still piping hot and crisp and massive!\n\nAloo Masala: erm. no. i make better. and ive had better from this baba who use to bring a small cooking pot filled with aloo masala from home next to Rainbow Centre. his were divine. i think he passed away. and i tried to recreate his at home. but his were the best. that thing about cooking with love? must've been it. used to make a very small quantity but it was absolutely spot onn the flavour you've heard of.\n\nUnfair of me to compare Cool-Inns with baba's. so why? well simpy cuz these aloo masala  from Cool Inn were big and chunky: the way they're supposed to be. but. the masala is kooti lal mirchi in not-very-bhunna hua tomato sauce. Masala needs to be well bhunna hua. if not it just tastes undone. and thats what cool-inn's was. i'll ignore it didnt have tamarind and thank heavens for autumn and flavourful coriander leaves otherwise i bet in teh summers id have flat flavoured coriander. \n\nnow Al-Rehman. \nbun kebabs were perfectly desi. thank God they asked if i wanted the typical or the one with ketchup and cole slaw: ICK!!! no no was good old desi egg-mashed lentil with onions and green chutney for me. moist. yum. desi bun kebab. you cant talk about theier flavours. no. not in words. you can just enjoy them. \n\naloo chholay: very home -made flavour. so i like\n\nthe one thing about alll three places today; everything was piping hot!

Prepared and served hygienically in disposable containers/plates.  Though I am not a Zinger type burger fan, however, people rave about Cool Inn's Zinger clone.  The masala dossa is also pretty decent and the Spicy Chicken Boti Bun has a unique flavour (be cautioned its really really spicy).  They also make a  great faluda and the cold-stone ice cream (which they call as Katakat Ice Cream) is very good for the price.  Love their dark chocolate flavour and have it  \"Katakated\" with Soft Mints with a topping of chocolate sauce.  They serve the Katakat Ice Cream in a waffle cup which is crispy and delicious.  A whole variety of ice cream flavours is available to suit all tastes. Cool Inn is a must visit place for all Chaat lovers.  Its great value for money.  The owner Noor Bhai is always present there and ensures quality and hygeine.  All their chutneys are made with mineral water and cooking/frying is done in Soya Supreme/Rafhan Corn Oil.  Orders for Rs. 400/- and above are delivered free of cost to adjacent areas.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-26T05:50:26+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"284400194944471","from":{"name":"Mohammed Sadiq Maniar","id":"835955450"},"message":"the paneer chicken is the best at Mehran Sajji, all of you must try it at clifton","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-26T06:28:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mjg0NDAwMTk0OTQ0NDcx","before":"MjgzOTAwMDg0OTk0NDgy"}}},"restaurantName":"Chaat"},{"id":"165861103465048_273298232721334","from":{"name":"Aamina Jahangir","id":"501859943"},"message":"Hunting for the BEST gujrati sev puri\n\nSWOTies- please start with the list :D! \n(no place which is tooooo ganda and will risk food poisoning)","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-07T12:02:58+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-07T23:52:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"100002605916001","name":"Sadaf Munir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjA1OTE2MDAx","before":"MTAwMDAxODU4NDUwMDEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"273298546054636","from":{"name":"Faisal Naseer","id":"780902784"},"message":"I have no idea what Sev Puri is but you might find it at Raaj Rasoi.
