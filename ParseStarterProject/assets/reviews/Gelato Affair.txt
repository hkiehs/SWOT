My eyes witnessed two blobs of ice cream- chocolate and vanilla, drizzled with chocolate sauce and topped with way too hard roasted almonds. Two ultra sweet wafers sticking from both sides- the wafers pretty much ruined my taste buds just like the almonds.\nThe ice cream too was run-of-the-mill.\nAn awesome waste of money.\nBut.

They were not prepared for larger groups. They were arrogant as none of them smiled or welcomed their guests. Mother Teressa said and i quote, \"Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echos are truly endless.\" At one point the server got frustrated and told his manager in front of me that they are not placing the order, where he said leave them and don't take order from them. I told them on their face that, that's a very rude gesture, even if my group has not placed an order, be patient and this is not the way, we will be paying the bill and not eating any of your deserts for free. He totally lost it and reverted, everyone pays ! One of my cousins, intervened and told him to behave, treat us right and don't panic, if they have space issues and they are not prepared for large groups showing up.\nNow i wonder , where is the concept of good customer service ???? after our desert session, when i was leaving that server and the manager did not respond when i said thank you !  :(","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-21T23:56:38+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-25T05:46:43+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"426636554054167","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"Ohh God!

However, i did tell them in a decent tone about their misbeahviour. On the other hand, I understand that some people get annoyed by the attitude of some waiters and they feel that it ruins their mood, but we have to understand that a person could just be having a bad day. While I fully believe that a person should wear a smile and treat those who help pay their salary with respect always, sometimes the stress of life can spill over and they can act in ways they don't intend. We also need to realize that a waiter does not get paid much even with the amount of tips they receive and on some days they don't even come away with minimum wage. That's why i left a good tip for him but i guess. both, the manager and the server were egregious. I wish they could understand how much harm they are causing to their restaurant/outlet and regular customers with their incorrect attitude and behaviour. :( I reckon we should start a training sessions for all the Head managers and after they are trained, they could train their servers/waiters inside the restaurants on how to treat customers and deal with awkward situations !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-22T01:57:08+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]},{"id":"426653550719134","from":{"name":"Faizan Karsaz","id":"542306225"},"message":"Any idea how to report this to the concerned person like the outlet owner or the franchisee ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-22T02:04:12+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"426662110718278","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Am deleting ur irrelevant comments Faizan Karsaz and Umer Hafeez.

Being in client services. Iv had my bad & worse days too but I never had a choice of even thinking of bringing a sad or frustrated expression on my face, bcoz if u do that once, no matter what, the customer tends to find out there's something wrong wid u, and we dare not let him do that coz we were always told as cliche that 'customer is the king' and 'its because of the customer that we are here'. So we put in our 100% to make him feel royal and majestic, with our treatment, behavior, expressions, tone of voice, gestures, service, etc. We used to take this as seriously as it was intended to be taken.  \n\nI can try and find out as to who the concerned person is for G.A because if these issues aren't highlighted, we only as customers will be suffering eventually, may be not at G.Affair, but if this practice becomes common and treated with least concern and zero priority, soon we will be victims of vicious service staff everywhere we go. Considering the already scarce entertainment in Pakistan, good food when eating out is all we can look forward to.\n\nI understand ur concerned that ur contacting the authorities concerned might pose a threat to the particular employees' job n well being, but I feel there's always a way to communicate the intended message, without sounding harsh, cruel or vengeful.
