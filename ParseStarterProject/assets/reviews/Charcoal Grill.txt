Ambiance was nice, a serene enviroment welcomes you on arrival. Unlike other places on that strip its not overcrowded despite having a crowded look on the outside. Seating arrangement is spacious and comfortable, with sofa's and chairs at three different levels. They have a upper deck, a middle level, a lower deck and a sheesha lounge, the middle two being right on the ocean and one can actually feel the tide come and hit the rocks below coupled will the flood lights on the sea which creates an enchanting effect.Coming to the service aspect both the staff and servers are more like programmed robots and need to be more vigilant to the diners needs, they keep sauntering around the place but to get hold of them is a tough task. A bottle of water took 15-20 minutes to arrive, its seemed like they were manufacturing it, drinks arrived ten minutes after dinner was served and I had to remind them, coordination is lacking and staff was not properly trained in this aspect. Ordered their Charcoal Combo platter, which was fresh and crisp comprising of batter fried mushrooms, chicken wings and fried chicken with mozzarella cheese accompanied with two yummy dips, also had the Beef Cheese Burger and Chicken Fajita Burger both well done, were well flavored, succulent pieces of grilled chicken breast and had a spicy tinge, but the bread was not as it should be, a bit soggy and quality of the bun could be improved, fries could be more crisp. For desert had Blueberry Cheese Cake was very good, light and fluffy with a biscuit crust, really melted in the mouth, a generous helping for two to three weight watchers. Overall experience was good, a place which stands out from the crowd and has an air of sophistication, recommended for foreign guests who may have the impression that Karachi is a city under siege or civil war, taking them to this places will showcase the soft face of Karachi and the beauty of the sea. They just need to work a tad bit more on their service.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-24T11:24:45+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-24T15:29:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"741265709","name":"Sarah Hasnat"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQxMjY1NzA5","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"403364046381418","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Try Kolachi next time.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T15:11:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403370973047392","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Kolachi is the next target...what do u recommend?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-24T15:27:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"403372099713946","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Hunzai Handi.
