It is obviously in our best interest to provide high quality service, which is why keep a set menu. Its not as if we force anyone to take the menu, upon taking reservations, the menu is explained and the customers oblige. I will admit that we had some errors in service. In the middle our gas went to next to nothing for about half an hour (not using that as an excuse). Once a few orders back up, well its a lot like the domino effect during rush hour. It should be rather obvious that we have no intention of  providing bad service or giving anyone a less than perfect experience. If that was the case, then Im pretty sure then we're in the wrong industry. Iit was a rather overwhelming response that night and some issues did occur. That being said, being a restaurant we dont penalize guests when the make reservations for a certain time and casually walk in half an hour late. Sure, it makes life difficult for us - but hey thats what hospitality is all about to provide excellent service.

In the case of any customer who wished not to have our selection of steak, they were offered another choice to cater to them. \n\nAs for our pricing, if you look at our menu prices and the total the offering through the set menu amounts to, there is a very slight float that ensures that we can provide a tailored setup (our lit tables, a DJ and lighting up the place in a red hue as well as to offer every lady guest who attended a long stem imported rose) to our guests on a special occasion to them. \n\nSo in summation, we felt our decision was a successful one especially subject to the personal feedback we received that night by all our patrons, old and new. \n\n:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-21T20:58:59+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"508560025861819","from":{"name":"Danyal Achria","id":"582960575"},"message":"For Valentines, The Patio decided to offer both, our full A la carte menu & a special Valentines set menu.

Although we had maybe 1-2 minor issues during the whole night, we got over a 95% positive feedback from all guest who dinned with us that night & that was out of almost 40 Couples. Nezihe to answer your question, our primary reason to have a special set menu was to offer certain dishes which were not on our menu & would give our patrons something new to try. Also with a set menu, you can customize it for the particular day, thus for valentines we were able to offer Chocolate Fondue with fresh fruits, Grilled Lobster & our Red Snapper plus much more within the set menu.

Since the weather got chilly again today after a few weeks, we opted to sit in the lawn. It was perfect. cool breeze, weak sunlight and great food. For starters we ordered buffalo wings and mozzarella sticks. the wings were delicious and meaty and oh so good!! I ordered the chef's special steak, which was perfectly cooked, juicy and melt-in-the-mouth divine. the juices of the steak and the special sauce formed the perfect blend. My friend is pregnant and she was craving something cheesy and creamy with chicken and mushrooms. the server, David, was very helpful and patient and they got her a special customized grilled chicken with the kind of creamy sauce she wanted along with spaghetti. It was nothing in front of my steak, lol, but she was really happy with it and the service was commendable.  \nWanted to have dessert but the news of unrest in the city made us anxious and we decided to leave. \nBut all in all, It was a perfect afternoon out and yet another great experience at Cafe 76.

Just the right tenderness for the chicken fillet and the sauce was the perfect blend of salt and sour. The gratin potato is now better than that of Aylanto's. Friend had the spicy fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken, which according to her was probably one of the best she's ever had in town. She claims the sauce to be very close to that of Pasta Mania. The chicken cacciatore remains the most interesting dish on the menu and has maintained the standard as well. Just order a side of mashed potatoes with sour cream (which btw is divine!) to go with everything else that you order. All in all - a meal at 76 has always been perfectly satisfactory. Definitely the go-to place for good food.\nFor me personally though - love sitting in the atrium section with friends.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-06T09:07:21+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-08T12:14:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1292708984","name":"Arshnoor Moosa"},{"id":"514290400","name":"Hirah Sid"},{"id":"641324643","name":"Nadia Moqeet"},{"id":"628916560","name":"Maahin Naveed"},{"id":"514440277","name":"M?ri?

Because after insisting on how we didnt want to go for a buffet, we actually ended up going to an all you can eat. Cafe 76 is one of my favorite places and after reading such good comments about their iftar i even booked a table there, but somehow my friend was in a mood for desi food. So we ended up going to bbq tonight. I think their iftari was fine. Not extra ordinary. And im used to them being spot on with every dish...hence i was even a bit disappointed. For instance, the bihari boti wasnt well done. And i also felt that having one buffet spread for the entire floor isnt a good idea. The place was packed with people and while getting our food we had to almost elbow our way through the crazy line. One nice thing was that we went without any reservation and their manager was super nice to us and managed to get us a table. There were many people standing, waiting for a table to get arranged in that crowded place, but i guess we were extremely lucky to get seated right away while all of them waited :P\nAll in all, not a bad experience..but honestly at one point i did wish i had talked my friend into going to cafe 76 instead.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-15T03:57:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDI0MzI0NzY3NjE4Njc5","before":"NDIzNjQ1NzUxMDE5OTE0"}}},"restaurantName":"Cafe 76"},{"id":"165861103465048_422149394502883","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Was dragged to Dolmen Mall - Mom Saba and Shaha my sister had to pick up some stuff from Khaadi..food news will come later!!
