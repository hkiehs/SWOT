An incident happened with me today only. I bought the spicy double Mc. Crispy large deal from Mc Donalds drive thru, phase 2 on Thursday. I had 500rp so I asked the guy before ordering about the exact price of the deal, didn't want to fall short on cash. He said 800rp. I was like excuse me?! It was somewhere between 380 and 450 a week ago. I asked him to show me a menu sheet, a request that he avoided by saying that he wasnt sure and that he'll confirm the price from the computer when I'll place the order. He said ke it is 630. Had I not raised my voice, he would have totally scammed me, I paid 630 (after borrowing from a friend) because I thought ke why would he lie. Now the twist is that I got the same deal for 389rp tonight from the sea view branch. So honesty, is a rare commodity. Just don't think that since the brand originated from some place abroad so they are going to be honest and trustworthy.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-27T23:46:56+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100001074657485","name":"Farhan Soomro","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"640833852634435","from":{"name":"Ammar Zubaid Ahmad","id":"100003292431830"},"message":"that happened to me once. tho it was a 500 rs note. asked him to keep the note anyway for his honesty","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-28T02:36:33+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"640851739299313","from":{"name":"Sameer Beg","id":"583446948"},"message":"Emil Farooq u shud take both the receipts and confront the cashier at phase 2. you paid 100% extra, i think u shud give them a piece of ur mind.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-28T03:28:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1669415344","name":"Emil Farooq","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"640898572627963","from":{"name":"Farhan Siddiqui","id":"649237316"},"message":"^totally...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-28T05:12:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"640908122627008","from":{"name":"Emil Farooq","id":"1669415344"},"message":"Oh yes :p I am going there today for lunch ;) going to ask for the same meal and since they lie so frequently, bam!

So I guess they can be forgiven if the quality not consistent at this time. At the same time I believe that the owners of BK same as Pizza Hut. Judging from the sad decline of Pizza Hut over the past years (especially past year) I hope they don't do the same with BK.

If BK owned by the same people who owned Pizza Hut then its bad news unless they totally revamp their quality control and dedication to providing a top quality product for a customer who had the kindness, courtesy and trust to part with his/her money for a reasonable dining experience. That's what going into the food business is all about: It's about returning that kindness and trust someone has for you and responding with the best quality possible for that money. I can't judge BK until I try it myself (maybe in a week or so when the crowds lessen a bit). Let's see how it goes. P.s. Have been a McDonald's fan ever since a kid and although we know the barrage of criticism and jokes McDonald's gets in the commercial aspect I respect them because they always maintain the quality and product, and that's especially important here in Pakistan. Only once or twice I had a bad experience with McDonald's here (stale bun) in many years. A friend of mine from L.A. who owns 3-4 Taco Bells, KFC's and a Pizza Hut there had McDonald's here and said it was far superior to any McDonald's in the US (the halal beef probably helps).","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-08T06:10:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"630288763688944","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"Why do people in our country in particular compare and expect the taste to be the same worldwide?

We are still looking at a few more locations for outlets. You'll find out soon. :)\n\nZubair , with all due respect, Hardee's aim was not just to open it's services for the SEC A. It's the masses you need to aim for first considering it's Hardee's and not Roasters. Also, if you have been to Lhr, you'd know MM Alam Road maybe like Zamzama, but it is morst frequented by the masses in general.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-26T18:53:12+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam","type":"user","offset":0,"length":4},{"id":"704566421","name":"Zubair","type":"user","offset":216,"length":6}]},{"id":"417251098326046","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Look at this...

Have had Fuchsia couple of times in the past week followed by the ever tantalising and unparallelled chicken biryani from none other than Cafe Students. Today it was Chinese. Frequent diners at Golden Dragon have spoken really high about this place so I decided to give in & let G.D play with my taste buds. Today was the second time I ordered in from there. I didnot find the deals attractive since I'm not a fan of atleast 2 out of the 4 dishes they offer in those deals. So, I selected & ordered 3 dishes from their menu online: The ever famous American Chopsuey, Kung Pao Chicken (on basis of strong recommendations by family & friends alike) along with a Thai item, Chicken in Coconut Red Curry. Food was delivered exactly in the one hour time that was communicated to me. The rider (unlike the ones at most of the other food delivery restaurants) had no problem locating my address. As per my instructions, the rider did not ring the door bell, instead called on the mobile number fed in the restaurant's computer system. (This was worth mentioning because I've experienced some major mishaps with riders from Dominos, Mc Donalds, Subway etc. ringing my doorbell & calling my name inspite of having the order takers make special note to NOT ring the doorbell, as it would awake my entire family in the middle of the night, & instead to call on my cell once they are at my doorstep; but all efforts in vain!)\n\n Anyways, food as expected, was delivered piping hot, in the most convenient packaging. It looked & tasted scrumptuous! The quantity was sufficient for 5 people. Family loved every bite of it & endlessly sang praises! Beginning from the order taker whose cooperative behavior & courtesy makes u feel cared for, to the chefs & service staff in charge, till the rider who assures ur delivered the ordered items in perfect timing & perfect condition,, Golden Dragon, ur doing a WOW job! When I'm baffled with what to order, you come in at the right time and make life easier! Got to tell u, u ROCK!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-10T21:02:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-11T15:46:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000522564819","name":"Imran Bahadur"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"849555062","name":"Hira Aslam"},{"id":"1258402550","name":"Ateeka Ovais"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQ1MzkwMTMxMw\u003d\u003d","before":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"411511492233340","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Thanks for the lovely review and kind words.

I have noticed this in fries made in my home also. This is, ofcourse, a personal opinion and I am sure there are many exceptions to this, such as yourself. Also, the imported fries are an indulgence for me and I quite enjoy the personal decadence. But, in all fairness, I will also add that I love good food but I can't cook / fry / boil anything myself so maybe its a technical thing.
