Ended up at Peking (this AWKWARD Chinese place at Bahadurabad) and I have been forced to share my review since i spent ...oh sorry wasted 1600 bucks. P.S the following pictures and reviews are about to notify serious competition to Golden Dragon, Red Emperor, Ginsoy and Chairman Mao....\nThe burger qaum (DHA/Clifton residents) is set to dine in at pricey places! Well long live all u eateries.....u guys charge for hygiene, standard and items mentioned on your menus!\n\nSo me and Shahroz Ali visited PEKING....the place was really really really shady but fully crowded with families since it was a sunday night. To my utter disappointed, the moment i opened the menu, my jaw dropped wide open! Nothing for less than Rs.500. Since i found it way to awkward (thinking i wud have rather bin to Red Emperor or Ginsoy for Chinese Dine in) i thought i'd place my order. We ordered 1 Chicken Fried Rice, 1 Lemon Chicken and 1 Hot n Sour Soup. The waiter told the servings were for 2 and my heart sank further. (so i was about to have 250 k sabzi chawal. 250 ka laal paani and nimboo murgi for 250! My hard earned Quaid e Azam :'( ) The order arrived within  15 mins while I kept observing the place. The trays they used were the steel ones used at burns road k tikkay wale....Neways this is what I got\n\nHot N Sour Soup. Simply liquid Ketchup, loaded with Hara Dhania (coriander) for God knows what reason\nLemon Chicken : Boiled chicken, cornflour in the stock as the gravy and literally half a litre lemon juice along with more lemon slices compared to the chicken\nChicken fried rice: Tasteless, completely raw veges\n\nHad a few bites and eventually got it all packed, since it got really late...ended up at Indus for Biryani! The portions were actually scanty and...v tried this place just for the heck of it.....Never Again\nFor all those who thought i can never criticize a place, here it it. I never post reviews about my bad experiences since if i just like to let go off being mean, but this place got my pukes stuck within my throat only!

Clifton and Defense can only dream of such a high turnover barring few exceptions! The waiters were grumpy, carpet was soiled and the person behind the counter was cute little Pakistani Chinese couple wearing slippers and crocs yet no one was complaining. Since we were just three and two of my companions were practically non eaters so whatever I ordered kept my taste preferences in mind..so ordered white hot and sour soup which was ok to be fair ? have had better white hot and sour at Yuan tung during lunch hours..it had overdose of bean sprouts and corn flour and the soup had become little lumpy due to over heating but taste wise it was OK..for starters we ordered bbq squid ? the serving was for four people ? loved it ? perfect taste and I think they have the best recipe for the same no other restaurant comes close to their version. In mains we ordered sweet and sour prawns, crispy chicken chilies and fried rice..regular menu options due to Ammas and sabas eating preferences but the servings were huge and taste wise everything was very good.. This Chinese is our old Chinese of the early 70?s or 80?s which none of the new entrants have been able to replicate even when we enter the premises the aroma takes you back 30 years ago which we miss in our side of the places. I guess someone needs to have their franchise here in Defense and it will be a surefire hit! Price wise it was not average but on the higher side but I guess with the competition and soaring prices of commodities they must have revised their prices also.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-22T05:47:03+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-22T06:00:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"641324643","name":"Nadia Moqeet"},{"id":"1432893682","name":"Shahid Zamir Shaikh"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"},{"id":"739670623","name":"Faryal Naqvi"},{"id":"511301771","name":"Eefa Khalid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTExMzAxNzcx","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"524872800897208","from":{"name":"Faryal Naqvi","id":"739670623"},"message":"thier food rocks","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-22T05:49:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"524872920897196","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"person \u003d couple :-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-22T05:50:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"524873400897148","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"My last experience there a couple of years ago was very bad thus I never went again, though I used to love the food at Yuan Tung.

To start of with its more in line with desi chinese kind of like some of the better chinese eateries off Tariq Road.  We started with the white hot & sour which was surprisingly good.  Then for the starters we had a couple of ducks and some fried prawn starters.  Both need to be really improved?the duck came with some variation of chapati rather than the chinese pancakes :-( The spring onions, cucumbers, and carrots(don't ask why), tasted pretty stale.  The prawn were really bad too?completely dry and tasteless and chewy.  Then came the main courses.  The fish am not sure of the name was pretty bad as well but the dry beef chill and orange chicken were really good.  The chow main was also really good but desi style.  I also liked the toffee banana with vanilla ice cream.  What I would like to give a special mention to was the young kid who is the proprietor of the place.  He came and asked about the food was extremely polite and took the feedback extremely well.  We need more people like him who don't get defensive and smile back and say next time they will strive to do better.  Two thumbs up to him.  But that said they need to completely redo the duck, the prawns, and the fish.  The comment I would like to end with is on the prices?.the prices were extremely good value for money and came to something around Rs.800 per head minus the duck and we really ordered a lot of food!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-02-04T14:14:26+0000","updated_time":"2012-02-05T13:48:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"100000374500079","name":"Misbah Nizami"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"516846714","name":"Haris Rahman Dittu"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NTg0NjgyMjQz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"310521872332303","from":{"name":"Farah Mirza Afridi","id":"620677462"},"message":"I'd like to add to that Ziad...

And retured with 2 doll size bowls with Hoisin sauce in them!! I don't know if this was some new Fusion Peking Duck?? The fried bananas (which are my favorite abroad) were also bland and honestly I've never seen a full banana fried and served before! Smaller pieces should be prepared and then served. Also we thought the prawns were actualy chicken cutlets with a prawn tail stuck to them. Lastly the music. Very few restaurants seem to get this right and play what the owner/employees like to listen to. I realy don't want to hear 'Dynamite' in a chinese restaurant. Pls put some instrumental music on. Not necesarily shrill chinese opera but I'm sure there are great oriental fusion melodies available.But the decor was nice and cheerful. Staff was very polite and accomadating.

We had ordered a full course dinner (since we were told that they are only taking reservations with set menus for now).\n\nThe affair started with chicken corn and chicken ginger soups which were different than the usual fare. Followed by appetizing sesame prawns toast, salt n pepper calamari on a bed of herbs, crispy chicken spring rolls, vege-wontons and zesty wasabi prawns which were simply divine. The main course comprised of pepper beef, chicken lo mien, orange chicken, shredded crispy beef in bird nest and sesame chicken.  Overall, the culinary experience was a pleasant departure from the run of the mill local offerings in terms of recipes and presentation.  We were also told that the food is MSG free by the wait staff that was attentive and courteous.\n\nWith eight guests, the tab ran us around 1500per head which I think is excellent value for a delectable full course dinner set in a warm unpretentious ambiance. I wish them well and hope to return soon to try the signature Peking duck next time around.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-10T19:22:28+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-10T21:27:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"780381887","name":"Samar Husain"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"575486349","name":"Amber Rizvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTc1NDg2MzQ5","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"293873143997176","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"What...u ate all that widout moi!
