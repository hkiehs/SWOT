Firstly, a customer's opinion is their right and that must be respected. However, as I have said numerous times, there must be some detail to why the opinion exists for it to be useful in a public forum like SWOT. Simply referring to price and talking about the concept of value for money isn't enough. Nor is an unsupported remark about service in a passing comment. And as Ali Tariq said, it is absolutely true that value for money varies wildly for each individual and that is how it should be.  However, frankly at 2400 per head, I don't think you can eat extraordinarily at Pompeii or Okra etc ... starters average around 4-500+, main courses range between 700 and 2400+, desserts and drinks on top of that ... add tax and tip, you are easily around the 3000 mark or more. Again, while respecting the right of people to have their opinion, I am just making the point that we all need to be responsible, clear and informative in conveying that opinion ... be it positive or negative ... statements without details dilute the value of the opinion for those of us who actually read them with interest. Finally, and this is my own personal thing, if I am happy with my dining experience, then that is value for money received ... however, as Merchant Abid said, even the I may find the restaurant too expensive to become a frequent customer and that is also fair enough!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-03T04:55:41+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"519505693","name":"Ali Tariq","type":"user","offset":481,"length":9},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid","type":"user","offset":1349,"length":13}]},{"id":"552473951470426","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"It's a pity your experience was not worthy of the money you spent.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-03T05:04:27+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTUyNDczOTUxNDcwNDI2","before":"NTUxMzkwNjgxNTc4NzUz"}}},"restaurantName":"Hook Line & Sinker - Seafood Restaurant"},{"id":"165861103465048_537172753000546","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"so today's highlight was the sampling of their very own dessert menu at Hook Line & Sinker - Seafood Restaurant \n\n(yes for free - go have a field day.........and get jealous that no one asks you for your opinion....this part within the brackets is for the \"grapevine\" who is no longer allowed in to SWOT but have resorted to Voyeurism)\n\nFirst the mention has to be made of the fantastic canap?s that were served to keep the balance between the desserts....but each morsel was amazing and the best thing was the homemade  tartar sauce.
