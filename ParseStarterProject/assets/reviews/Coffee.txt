It's very reasonably priced.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-03T08:12:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1132270217","name":"Samia Nabil Sheikh","type":"user","offset":6,"length":18}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjYwODk5ODM3Mjk0NTAz","before":"NjYwODU2NzczOTY1NDc2"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_660848647299622/comments?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjYwODk5ODM3Mjk0NTAz"}},"restaurantName":"Coffee"},{"id":"165861103465048_654729031244917","from":{"name":"Muhammad Danniyal Jafri","id":"769030393"},"message":"What is best at Nandos? any suggestions. :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-21T05:06:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-22T00:20:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODA3Njc1Njk2","before":"ODA3Njc1Njk2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"654732907911196","from":{"name":"Khalid Jamil","id":"577745954"},"message":"Desi Murghi ki yakhni :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-21T05:25:23+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"654733244577829","from":{"name":"Belinda Fonseca","id":"851275369"},"message":"Peri bites and Coffee cake","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-21T05:27:02+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"654733771244443","from":{"name":"Hassan Khan","id":"535065551"},"message":"these days nothing","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-21T05:28:21+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"654735297910957","from":{"name":"Khalid Jamil","id":"577745954"},"message":"once upon a time, peri bites :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-21T05:35:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"654735347910952","from":{"name":"Adnan Yasin","id":"723675110"},"message":"i went there last week....ordered their trademark chicken with mild flavor....it was really good ....

This is definitely something the management at BBQ Tonight can fix..\n\nComing to the main attraction food.. There was a good variety of almost every item one can think of in Karachi.. Omelettes, Pan Cakes with Maple, Chocolate, Strawberry Syrups and Honey, French Toast, Sarson ka Saag Makayi ki Roti, Sausages, Fried Fish, Halva Puri Tarkari and Chanay, Nihari, Fresh Fruits, Cereals, Variety of different bakery items like cake rusk and croissants, Salads, Lassi(Sweet and Salty Both), Coffee and Tea.. Milk(Hot and Cold), Fresh Dahee.. You name what you have tried for breakfast in Pakistan they had almost everything there.. \n\nWe had mixed reviews for almost everything.. Overall great value for money and everyone had something to eat.. Perfect place to take your family and no one would complain..\n\nPancakes and French Toast need to be improved ALOT..

It hardly melted in my mouth and I had to chew through each bite. The coffee frosting was a bit better but it lacked the bitterness of the coffee that is supposed to cut through the sweetness. It was a bit too sweet for my taste. I?ll give it a 6/10. I don?t know what all the hype was about.

Recommend Mao Kung Pao Chicken, Mao Orange Chicken, Mao Beef in Black Bean Sauce and Mao Szechwan Spicy Chicken from their New Chinese Menu.  In case you wanna order Thai, their New Dish \"Mao Red Curry\" is a must try and it goes great with Jasmine Rice.  All time favorites are Thai Beef in Oyster Sauce, Stir Fried Chicken with Roasted Cashews, Chicken with Cashew Nuts, Chicken in Tamarind Sauce, Beef with Garlic and Pepper, Crispy Fish and Spicy Thai Fried Noodles.  All dishes go very well with Steamed Jasmine Rice. And while you are ordering from Chairman Mao, I'd highly recommend you order their Gelato, my favorite flavors being Chocolate, Coffee, Ferrero and Mint Chocolate Chip.  Btw, I also love their Japanese menu and find their Sushi to be better than what is served at Sakura and Fujiyama.

Initial impression: Clean, spare, light and airy. We were on a quick stopover, so 2 Americanos, one cupcake, one order of fries with garlic Mayo. Being the 'quiet zone' Nazi I am, asked the waiter to tone down the music, after which we settled in and sampled their fare. Coffee, taste 7/10, temperature 6/10, presentation 8/10. Fries; taste 8/10, quantity 9/10, presentation 9/10. Chatted with the young owner and got to find out more about the place/pricing/customer profile (its mostly women btw).

Fattoush Salad: must clarify all \"preconceived notions\" aside, the fattoush was as authentic as i have loved it for 18 years, until.... the pomegranite juice sweetness kicks in. Thank heavens its a mild presence so of the entire bowl the sweetness hit in bare few bites instead of a presence in the entire salad. Which means whenever there was no pomegranite juice (which fell to the base of the bowl\n: proving it was fresh juice) the salad was DELICIOUS.  \n\n2. Gourmet Fries: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10151603200767065&set\u003dpb.185841542064.-2207520000.1365953466&type\u003d3&theater  now when i saw this picture posted on Thursday the temptation to hit LP multiplied. I dont know why, my folly or the \"seeing is not believing\" or \"aankhon ka dhoka\" for some odd reason i thought the image portrayed curly fries. They weren't . they were typical fries which LP's next door neighbour serves. the fries had a sprinkle of turkey bacon chips, a drizzle of cheese/ white sauce and bare greens. Erm. Again. i was only disappointed because i was expecting teh picture. To have a platterful of fries is, otherwise, never a complaint. \n\n3. Banh Mi: The Vietnamese Sandwich. The sandwich was lovely, slightly bland, and quite tasty ONLY till you were not expecting a \"vietnamese\" flavour. now. I love Far Eastern Food, and Vietnamese and Thai are among favourites. i may not be a chef, but i know my flavours. and Sadly. Tthis sandwich, delicious as it was, lacked two things:\ni. original vietnamese flavour. could taste no sweetness/ saltiness/ sour acidity or anything. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_cuisine. it lacked flavour. period. if ntohing, it essentially needed lemon and chilli punch, and some spring onions. \nthe baguette was filled with very moist melt-in-your-mouth chicken pieces, plenty of coriander leaves, some mayo and other julienned veggies. On its own, without the \"vietnamese\" description it was good. quite good. except for the lack of vietnamese flavour and well.. teh sad second thing im about to point out:\nii: first bite you take and you can get an aroma and flavour. a flavour we all know very well. the biggest sadness: the bread/ baguette tasted like a pure bun kebab bun. \n\nBut without the description (bun kebab flavour of baguette notwithstanding) the sandwich was quite nice, on its own. the feta cheese salad on the side with cherry tomatoes: too refreshing. just yum. \n\n4. Drinks: DELIGHTFUL. i. Love absolutely love the diner sized glasses and helpings. The Cold Coffee/ Coffee Frappe was marvellous. A perfect blend of chilled, creamy but not rich or heavy, flavoured aromatic coffee and thickness was just beautiful. The other drink: Raspberry Lime was simply pure summer drink. \n\nOverall:\n-  the helpings are rather, just a tinsy winsy bit, small for the prices. fattoush salad for 375 is a bit steep, as was the fries for 280 with the toppings (to make them gourmet they need a lot more). sandwich for 450 was also slightly small, but similar prices are offered at other eateries so... thats quite a few who need to get teh price-quantity element right. \n- Presentation was good. Im still jaw dropped at teh diner feel of the drinks. lovely tall milkshake diner glasses. for 300 and 330 and the punch of flavour its all so delightful.  fries came on a platter. sandwich came on a thick wooden board atop butterpaper. \n\nwill i go back? hell yeah for those drinks and the fattoush: oh yeah.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-14T15:53:56+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T16:55:30+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"620145354","name":"Bina Saeed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjIwMTQ1MzU0","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"540184456032709","from":{"name":"Bina Saeed","id":"620145354"},"message":"im hungry","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-14T16:00:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"550141611703660","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"here you go Madiha Sultan Tai","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-29T16:55:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"24440","name":"Madiha Sultan Tai","type":"user","offset":12,"length":17}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTUwMTQxNjExNzAzNjYw","before":"NTQwMTg0NDU2MDMyNzA5"}}},"restaurantName":"Coffee"},{"id":"165861103465048_540279102689911","from":{"name":"Rabiyah Tungekar","id":"516995421"},"message":"Had an amazing Breakfast at Gloria Jeans Coffee today.

We also have to see how difficult it is to make and the time it takes. Macarons are made by Lal Majid her self and not the bakers so that factors in. On top of that all of our fillings are ganache (not butter cream) made from real chocolate of course so the costs add up. Our margins on macarons are tiny and the price has remained Rs 75 since we started selling them 3 years ago. As you know globally they cost upwards of Rs 200.

Such was my experience at Bella Veta, yesterday. \n\nA friend and me, decided to go there for coffee. I went there at about 5ish, usually a not so busy hour I guess as when I reached I was the only one there. The decor of the place is obviously nice and the cakes and gelato staring you from behind the glass counter tends to work your appetite. But the thing that damped the experience was the service. The waiters seemed to have lost the plot. They were rather loud. Talking loudly and crudely amongst each other. In one instant one of the guys told someone to \"daffa ho\" or something on those lines. And since there was no one there, the waiters did not seem to bothered clean the tables up, left vacant after the customers gone. Only when I went to my table the waiter cleaned the table. Reminding one of those nihari places. I would not have minded had it been a nihari place but this is suppose to be a upscale resturant if I am not mistaken. \n\nAnyways, enough with the bad service. Let's move on the good part. I only ordered the coffee but my friend ordered the stuffed mushrooms and a roasted beef club sandwich. The mushrooms were ok. Nothing to write home about. My friend however thought they were good. However the club sandwich was absolutely gorgeous. Huge sandwiches and they were quite generous with the potatoe wedges and the stuffings of the sandwiches. I sadly did not have any as I am on a diet but I will be sure to try them as soon as I am off my diet. Coffee was fairly good as well. On another brighter note, the prices seemed reasonable. Two water bottles, two cappuccinos and an order each of stuffed mushrooms and the beef club sandwich came to 1900 and change.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-03-31T04:54:01+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-31T04:54:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"517583112","name":"Rafia Farooqui"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3NTgzMTEy","before":"MTAwMDAxNDU2MDU5MDk1"}}},"picture":"http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/9650_10151848145112785_606355708_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10151848145112785&set\u003dgm.530799920304496&type\u003d1&relevant_count\u003d3","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif","restaurantName":"Coffee"},{"id":"165861103465048_525009727550182","from":{"name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed","id":"786471893"},"message":"What are the best places to go for breakfast on a Sunday morning?

Few top name include  ESPRESSO, Gloria Jean's Coffees Pakistan, Chairman Mao, LALS Chocolates, Cinnabon Pakistan, The Chatterbox Cafe, The Second Floor (T2F), and the list is never ending .....\n\nThe best part is the reward points that you collect, you have by check-in (PUNCH) by ur phone through the olaround app every time u checkin u  make loyalty points and can redeem the same on the same store.\n\nAnother good part is that it has a GPS function which tells u what's close by to eat, shop or services. u can also search by whats ur mood like wana eat pizza or baryani so it will suggest u closest outlet register. \n\nHave fun, enjoy and save some bucks a the same time..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-28T04:02:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-28T04:02:41+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501447368","name":"Lubna Ashraf Jafri"},{"id":"516595492","name":"Ashfaq Shah"},{"id":"1035164226","name":"Daniyal Aamir"},{"id":"100002768572539","name":"Mahrukh Mirza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNzY4NTcyNTM5","before":"NTAxNDQ3MzY4"}}},"restaurantName":"Coffee"},{"id":"165861103465048_507885945929227","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"At Hook Line & Sinker last eve with Faisal Anwar, Shaban Butt and Shamsi Zia.  Had reserved a table at the Upper Deck of HLS which during this time of the year is the ultimate place to enjoy an evening.  Overdosed on the bread basket and the garlic butter which probably is one of the finest in town, the four of us finished something like six bread baskets.  For starters, SB & I both ordered the Smoked Salmon which was outstanding and FA & SZ had the Seafood Chowder.  Recommended Red Snapper to FA and he was pretty satisfied with it.  SB tried the Lobster Ala Marvi and he seemed happy although the serving size seemed to be an issue with him coz he had half of my Seafood Kat-a-Kat which was made to perfection with spice level that was just right for a dish like Kat-a-Kat.  ZS was the odd one out ordering some Chicken entr?e  (though I recommended him to try the white snapper).  He didn't seem too happy with his choice.  Am quoting ZS from his fb profile \"Hook Line & Sinker.  Average food and pathetic dessert.  Wastage of money notwithstanding \"lovely\" hospitality\".  The Kiwi Mousse & Coffee Mousse were way below average and Zara Tareen was very kind enough to offer that the same will be taken off the tab, however, the credit card had already been charged so she texted me that the next around the desserts will be on HLS and they will be better ones.  Service was impeccable.  Ambience, one of the best you can find in Karachi.  Starters & Main Courses, top quality ingredients & lovely presentation.  HLS is all set to be the No. 1 restaurant of Pakistan.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-20T05:43:07+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-20T16:11:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"734560115","name":"Syed Masud Naqvi"},{"id":"714178973","name":"Fatimah Jameel"},{"id":"604074782","name":"Farheen Jeelani"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"100003784320529","name":"Shahzad Saeed"},{"id":"1039106808","name":"Shaban Butt"},{"id":"100000018754614","name":"Faisal Anwar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwMDE4NzU0NjE0","before":"Njg3MjU1NDgy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"507894409261714","from":{"name":"Shamsi Zia","id":"1367979764"},"message":":)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T06:21:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"507894435928378","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Who is ZS!!!!!\n\nMystery Man.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T06:21:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"507894799261675","from":{"name":"Faisal Anwar","id":"100000018754614"},"message":"I had a great time, lovely place I was impressed by the perfection on the restaurant outlay and ambiance ...... enjoyed company of friends...I guess one of the few places where one could spend quality time with friends and have a good relaxing laugh..................","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T06:23:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"507897122594776","from":{"name":"Shamsi Zia","id":"1367979764"},"message":"No doubt , ambiance  and hospitality of HLS is gr8 but seefood at BOTS is the best.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T06:27:51+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"507897422594746","from":{"name":"Shamsi Zia","id":"1367979764"},"message":"Agree with FA to the the extent that \" one of the few places where one could spend quality time with friends and have a good relaxing laugh..................ONLY","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T06:28:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"507905109260644","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"ZS is Shamsi Zia Doc.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T07:01:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1367979764","name":"Shamsi Zia","type":"user","offset":6,"length":10}]},{"id":"507919999259155","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Shamsi Zia, guess your are missing the Natural \"Blonde\", I mean the Suicide \"Blonde\" Chutney of BOTS.

Menu is rather limited and although it is presented rather nicely on a chalk board, the menu does NOT mention prices! That is bound to give many a heart a bit of an arrhythmia, specially those who will be paying the bill for the evening! The bread basket (served on a plate) was rather abbreviated. Clam chowder was nice and thick with the right amount of solids, but too tangy. The seafood gratin was too salty and the Verde chicken was a surprise: sweet more than savory. Perhaps it was meant to be so (fusion of some sort) but since there was no description available on the menu board, nor volunteered but he waiter, the first bite came as a bit of a shock. The place offers 3 items in its desserts, of which one was not available. Brownie with ice cream was fine (but it would be tough to go wrong with that) and the other available item, the lemon tart, seemed to be in two components, the top totally dissociated with the bottom. Coffees were excellent.\nAlthough we had chosen to sit inside the glass box, but the excellent atmosphere was destroyed when a bunch of school boys decided to start smoking in the closed environment. Midway through the meal we had to make a request to be relocated outside. The inside part of the restaurant should be strictly non smoking. Outside was actually more pleasant this evening than the air-conditioned inside. \nVerdict: We will certainly revisit Verde again?..for coffee, after dinner at Aylanto!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-02T17:36:31+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-02T19:38:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"622525326","name":"Mohsin E Azam"},{"id":"1035164226","name":"Daniyal Aamir"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"516133963","name":"Haadia Farooqui"},{"id":"881200022","name":"Amna Alam"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"558690791","name":"Zehra Zaidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTU4NjkwNzkx","before":"NjIyNTI1MzI2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"455059737878515","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"And I thought I was the only doctor who is a food critique in town. \n\nThank you for a very detailed and surgically precise review.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-02T18:02:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"455089874542168","from":{"name":"Amenah Jafarey","id":"671130091"},"message":"Love this AC.

The restaurant has been designed very well indeed, and beckons the customer to go in, sit down and order something off the menu. Three of us went for lunch there today, but although the ambience is absolutely lovely from the front counter side... With wooden panelling, slate rules, large suede couches, and bookshelves to give it that homely feel... The large dirty windows overlooking the beach and promenade as well as an outer courtyard of the mall made a new place look run down. After going through the menu we decided to order the Philly steak sandwich, beef burger and chicken burger. We then realised orders were self service, so two of us went ahead to place them and one stayed behind to keep our spot. \nWhen my friends returned they told me they had ordered a chic coffee shake and a soda with syrup as the cafe does not serve the standard soft drinks. I then wanted to place an order for the beef burger but the girl behind the counter said they didn't  have any and suggested I try the classic burger instead. I also ordered a choc drink without cream. \nAs we ordered separately our food arrived at different times. While the steak sandwich tasted relatively good, it included large black peppers and the green pepper filling seemed soggier than it should be. My classic burger seemed like it was put together with dawn burger buns and was really a standard minced patty with an unmelted slice of processed cheddar cheese on top. The fries were much too pale, and bland. The coffee and chic drink tasted like frozen milo and while the soda cost 300 bucks - 50 extra for flavoured syrup. The burgers cost around 450 excluding tax - but gbc is far far better. \nAll in all a disappointing debut. Staff were friendly though and perhaps we just chose badly.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-21T19:59:44+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-22T08:29:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"517638658","name":"Natasha Durrani"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTg0NjgyMjQz","before":"NTE3NjM4NjU4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"383691411682015","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Shimaila Matri Dawood:- A very comprehensive and detailed review, buttom line is the food is average and not much to write about, coffee is a bit better I heard ,more people need to swot dmc gj and write their reviews, gj needs to get their act together, as they will have to face some serious competition when the complete food court opens shortly.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-21T20:16:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"383695491681607","from":{"name":"Najeeb Rehman","id":"749703456"},"message":".. buttom.. .?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-21T20:23:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"383913594993130","from":{"name":"Ambareen Khan","id":"676177213"},"message":"Just went last night, review to follow...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-22T02:57:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"383985091652647","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Typo...bottom!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-22T06:09:12+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"384023288315494","from":{"name":"Saman Jafri","id":"685000480"},"message":"the only food item worth mentioning is their club sandwich - Coffee and deserts are nice though and I love the ambiance !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-22T08:29:15+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzg0MDIzMjg4MzE1NDk0","before":"MzgzNjkxNDExNjgyMDE1"}}},"restaurantName":"Coffee"},{"id":"165861103465048_382894448428378","from":{"name":"Unjela Kaleem","id":"827696876"},"message":"went to tutti frutti today.....amazing that the cashier was not giving any receipts.

Coffee and water arrived late despite reminders but no apology.....I never posted it here. Because some people do live their lives with TOLERANCE and understand that majority of people in Pakistan (the service providers) are not aware of basics simply because they are not given any proper training...so I dont blame them at all. The onus lies on people who open places without giving full training to their staff!!   The point I was trying to make was not about teething problems...it is about basic ethics and surprisingly here i have noticed that all teething problems boil down to where money matter are concerned.......BTW, I notice lot of tolerance amongst Pakistanis but for all the wrong reasons and at the wrong times!!!!

The pastries over there were divine , I had the rasberry cheescake and the caramel eclairs WOWZA! They're pretty pricey at around SAR 10 - 15 a piece but totally worth it. You can also buy a cup of Coffee over there , so it makes for a great breakfast. There are loads of small ghetto-ish looking Turkish Cafe's in Makkah they do awesome \"Doner Kebabs\" \"Iskander Kebabs\" and \"Qabsa\" definitely head to one of them ask any local in the city where the nearest \"MATAM TURKIYE\"  (Arabic for Turkish Restaurant) is . There are a bunch of Sudanese and various African run establishments slightly away from the Haram circle look for the signs saying \"FUUL\" (in Arabic) , just for being adventurous try Fuul its like an African delicacy made of beans, chickpeas and various spices .  If by any chance you start to miss Pakistani food head to the Hotel Ravi in Madinah its right across the street from Al Baik if I am not wrong there's only one Al Baik in Madinah. OMG that place does the best Pakistani food I've had outside Pakistan , great Chicken Karahi , Chicken Achari and by far the best Lassi I've ever had (seriously even Lahore couldn't beat it ). One word of advice the best food in both of the cities is in areas slightly away from the respective Haram circles. If you plan to stay within the Haram areas then your choices are restricted to the cliche  Starbucks, KFC, McD's , Hardees , Baskin & Robbins and really really bad Shawarma's .

Everyone liked their main course, although we did have to tell them to go easy on the chili while ordering. For dessert we ordered Bread Pudding which was good, but would be better without the raisins (maybe next time I'll request it that way, not a fan of raisins), Cold Coffee - bitter but good and the Devil's Chocolate Cake which was a hit, as usual.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T06:52:45+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-06T06:52:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"505630511","name":"Maliha Tariq-Ahmad"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"61308574","name":"Owais Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjEzMDg1NzQ\u003d","before":"NTA0MDkzOTk3"}}},"restaurantName":"Coffee"},{"id":"165861103465048_312500698801087","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Olivetto organized my wife's birthday celebration.

Oh the risotto was a work of art.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-02-07T06:38:58+0000","updated_time":"2012-02-08T10:13:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"685000480","name":"Saman Jafri"},{"id":"523063452","name":"Amber Raza Aarij"},{"id":"512185530","name":"Sidra Shah"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002269508419","name":"Sanam Durrani"},{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"595441955","name":"Muneeza Kazi"},{"id":"1053828627","name":"Afroze Khan"},{"id":"554938233","name":"Aisha Malik"},{"id":"1768497575","name":"Ally Aadil Bhamani"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"100002605916001","name":"Sadaf Munir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjA1OTE2MDAx","before":"Njg1MDAwNDgw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"312503412134149","from":{"name":"Mariam Bilgrami","id":"603490700"},"message":"Would it be horribly inappropriate to ask how much something like that cost?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-07T06:49:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"312505195467304","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"No. Not really.

Once again a fab experience worth writing home about :) Gave the Roast beef sandwich with wasabi mayo and Prawn burger a go last night.... couldn't decide which one was better! The Roast Beef was cooked to perfection, neither under nor over-cooked. The wasabi hit on the palate was euphoric, and the wasabi mayo salad accompanying the sanwich was a wow-factor. The Prawn Burger was tender n juicy, smelt and tasted terrific and came with a generous amount of fries! The best part about TUC is you leave feeling blissfully full but not sinfully heavy, perhaps because everything is portioned sensibly and mostly made in-house with the freshest and highest quality ingredients. Rounded off the evening with two scoops of Coffee & Hazlenut Gelato (the hot-selling Sicilian Pistachio had run-out). The Gelato's with their silky sheen were super-smooth and delicate. Wanted to try the cheesecakes, but were too full. Plan to pick one up on saturday for a dinner..... would be great if Hav Joe recommends his personal favorite! Another great feature of TUC is that even though the place is brimming with customers, it's not noisy. On the contrary, it has a great cozy feel, which should be attributed to Hamid's warm and welcoming persona. Thanks for a great dining experience. We eagerly await the launch of the Chelo's :)","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-01T11:25:26+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-01T11:25:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"1249052648","name":"Shirin Ali Khan"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4","before":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz"}}},"restaurantName":"Coffee"}]}
