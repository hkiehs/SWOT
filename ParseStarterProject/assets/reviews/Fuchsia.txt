We arrived with big appetites and high expectations. For starters we ordered the flame grilled soya marinated beef. We inhaled the dish in about 12.4 seconds. The beef was moist, tender and bursting with acidic flavors. After that, the wait for the main course seemed a bit long but it was most probably the pent up anticipation. Then the red curry chicken with chili lime and steamed fish in chili and garlic sauce arrived. Wow. Absolutely unbelievable flavors. The curry was rich and creamy as promised and the fish reminded me of the road-side steamed fish in garlic and lime sauce from Bangkok. I was in heaven. Rather, I was in Bangkok again. The service was impeccable and the experience was perfect. If I were to nitpick, I think the portion sizes are appropriate for two but a little small for 3-4 diners. With that said, the entire meal came to less than Rs. 2000 so I dare not complain. Needless to say, the waiter got a big tip and I came home with an even bigger belly :) Fuchsia","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-13T18:16:50+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-13T23:59:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"514017528","name":"Omar Kazmi"},{"id":"759420423","name":"Huzefa Marvi"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"582076905","name":"Obaid Sattar"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"617601286","name":"Insia Iqbal"},{"id":"639961936","name":"Moiz A.

I even loved their weird sweet pumpkin dessert.\n\nToday was no exception for the 7 of us - since the 8th one forgot to RSVP (which by the way means you are getting NO more invites from me) - debated between CHINA KITCHEN or FUCHSIA (ok I put up the debate everyone else was unanimous) - short story long we landed up at FUCHSIA.\n\nI arrived a few minutes late to find my friends seated comfortably, half had ordered and one was enjoying a fluorescent blue drink - something margarita. \n\nThe order was taken by a very competent Irfan. Loved his smiling face and courteous nature, also when he conspiratorially told me on a few orders \"madam order two,  one will be too little\" I knew he was our perfect host for the evening......he had understood here are the eaters. SWOT gatherings are dry....we concentrate only on the food and its quality.\n\nWhat all did we order:-\n1) clear Tom yum soup with seafood,\n2) the cloudy Tom  yum \n3) the coconut cream based Tom yum gha soup \n4) papaya salad without prawns (hence chicken)\n5) papaya salad normal\n6) soya beef (oh god in wish I had order one for each)\n7) Thai prawn cakes.\n8) beef in oyster sauce,\n9) dry beef chilie (divine)\n10) wok fried prawns \n11) chicken red curry\n12) spicy Pad Thai noodles,\n13) stir fry glass noodles,\n14) chocolate mousse (3)\n15) fried chocolate wontons with green tea ice cream (2)\n16) iced Thai tea \n17) fuchsia coloured pi?a colada\n18) orange juice (only thing disappointing on the order)\n19) cold drinks\n20) green tea.\n\nHOLY SWOT......did the 7 of us seriously order and eat all this food. WOW WE ARE PAITOOS.\n\nit was an unprecedentedly a great evening. Loved every morsel of what we ate. I will love the left overs for naashta, since I  scraped all the sauces from all the curries and dishes in to one - like a Thai Haleem. \n\nToday I discovered that I am a little low on some vitamins - after this meal the vitamin C from the birds eye will cover all that.\n\nTeam Aylanto - this is e best thing you could have done for Karachi. \n\nOne point - it's amazing that the best chocolate mousse in town is served at a Thai restaurant.

So best is what Sadia Jaffer and Syed Zubair Bin Saeed suggested, iv always been there for lunch, and even though I paid above 1300/- per head (approximately), using the ala carte, I didn't feel guilty, bcoz we had ordered 3 main course dishes, filled ourselves to the brim and returned happy!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-13T21:29:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"10403487","name":"Mehreen Obaid","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13},{"id":"517795912","name":"Sadia Jaffer","type":"user","offset":327,"length":12},{"id":"576972332","name":"Syed Zubair Bin Saeed","type":"user","offset":344,"length":21}]},{"id":"423913950993094","from":{"name":"Syed Zubair Bin Saeed","id":"576972332"},"message":"I WANT FUSHIA NOW!! :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-13T21:57:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423915990992890","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"Lol me too!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-13T22:04:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"424147687636387","from":{"name":"Syed Zubair Bin Saeed","id":"576972332"},"message":"On the way to Fuchsia now *happy dance* :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-14T16:19:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"424150054302817","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"Haha if i say i m turning green with envy, it wont be wrong!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-14T16:26:34+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"424174490967040","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"Syed Zubair Bin Saeed waiting to find out wat u ordered n how the experience was, iv ordered from golden dragon to compensate for the intense craving for spicy thai n chinese food","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-14T17:50:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"576972332","name":"Syed Zubair Bin Saeed","type":"user","offset":0,"length":21}]},{"id":"424214390963050","from":{"name":"Mehreen Obaid","id":"10403487"},"message":"I guess what we did was we ordered a main course each as family style and there were 8adults and we shared everything as we would do alacarte so didn't mind the one main course option","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-14T20:29:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"424216220962867","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"That works out really well with atleast 6 or more people, I wish they had a dinner buffet with all the scrumptious and tantalizing items on their main course menu","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-14T20:37:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"424264607624695","from":{"name":"Syed Zubair Bin Saeed","id":"576972332"},"message":"Shumyla Jawaid I got home late after a very long dinner & was in a food-coma so couldn't talk or write :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-14T23:44:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]},{"id":"424267847624371","from":{"name":"Syed Zubair Bin Saeed","id":"576972332"},"message":"We went post Iftaar & ordered what I like, papaya salad (which is always done perfectly), Red chicken curry (which was the biggest downer of the night) as it was not as great as it usually is, saut?ed chicken chilli & cashew nuts, cooked to perfection & superb taste (maybe not very Thai in flavour but me likes) and Wok fried prawns with basil & oyster sauce, Divine!!\nWe ordered two items we hadn't tried earlier, Prawn & chestnut dumplings, cooked fine, tasted fine, nothing major (my 3 yr old niece enjoyed it thoroughly thou) & Spicy Beef with bamboo shoots & baby egg plant in kachai sauce, I think this is a relatively new addition to the menu & neither the chilli level on the menu nor the waiters precautionary remarks could have prepared us for the burst of flavour & chilli, if you are a spice lover & can handle chilli this is a must try.\nI am not a fan of their deserts & after so much food their was no room for one either.

In awe of your superb lunch deals that we tried today, and sad because we did not try them earlier!! \n\nThe three course lunch deals with mocktails at Rs 644 + tax are actually too good to be true. Although I wanted to sample some of the strongly SWOT-recommended entrees, one glance at the deals, and I decided we were all going for them. And am I glad that we did! \n\nNot only was the food scrumptious to the core, the portions were more than ample. (we were quite skeptical about the portion sizes.) I took the Seafood deal and Irfan opted for the Beef deal while our daughters shared the Pasta deal. \n\nSo here's what came to our table: \nStarters: \n  Hot & Sour Soup: tangy, fragrant and flavourful. Loved it!\n  Som Tam (papaya salad): fresh, crunchy and fiery. just as I like it!\n  Chilli Honey Glazed Wings: the quantity (five wings) was impressive, taste was a little ketchup-y but it fared well with the girls. \n\nEntrees:\n   Wok Fried Beef with basil chilli oyster sauce served with steamed rice: Verrry generous portion, scrumptious, a tad bit less flavourful than Fuchsia's. \n   Tamarind Chilli Fish with Basil served with rice: Thank God for the separately served tamarind sauce!! The lightly battered fish was very crisp and did not turn soggy as it usually does after being doused with the sauce. \n   Fettuccine Alfredo: Looked awesome. and the girls polished it off! \n\nDesserts:\n   Bread & butter pudding with ice cream: ohmygodthatwastoogood!! I am definitely going to be dreaming about it for days to come!\n   Chocolate Molten Lava Cake served with ice cream: The chocolate was not strong enough, although the cake was very moist. Ice cream was awfully crystallized. \n\nDrinks:\n   Pina Colada, Lemon Margarita, and Fresh Lime with 7-up: All good!\n\nNeedless to say, we were stuffed beyond imagination! The place is lovely and very pleasant. The seating is highly comfortable. The outdoor patio is such a romantic spot. :)\nThe servers were very courteous and prompt. However, somehow our server was not knowledgeable enough about the lunch deals. He missed our drinks totally and was kind of puzzled when we asked about them.

Have had Fuchsia couple of times in the past week followed by the ever tantalising and unparallelled chicken biryani from none other than Cafe Students. Today it was Chinese. Frequent diners at Golden Dragon have spoken really high about this place so I decided to give in & let G.D play with my taste buds. Today was the second time I ordered in from there. I didnot find the deals attractive since I'm not a fan of atleast 2 out of the 4 dishes they offer in those deals. So, I selected & ordered 3 dishes from their menu online: The ever famous American Chopsuey, Kung Pao Chicken (on basis of strong recommendations by family & friends alike) along with a Thai item, Chicken in Coconut Red Curry. Food was delivered exactly in the one hour time that was communicated to me. The rider (unlike the ones at most of the other food delivery restaurants) had no problem locating my address. As per my instructions, the rider did not ring the door bell, instead called on the mobile number fed in the restaurant's computer system. (This was worth mentioning because I've experienced some major mishaps with riders from Dominos, Mc Donalds, Subway etc. ringing my doorbell & calling my name inspite of having the order takers make special note to NOT ring the doorbell, as it would awake my entire family in the middle of the night, & instead to call on my cell once they are at my doorstep; but all efforts in vain!)\n\n Anyways, food as expected, was delivered piping hot, in the most convenient packaging. It looked & tasted scrumptuous! The quantity was sufficient for 5 people. Family loved every bite of it & endlessly sang praises! Beginning from the order taker whose cooperative behavior & courtesy makes u feel cared for, to the chefs & service staff in charge, till the rider who assures ur delivered the ordered items in perfect timing & perfect condition,, Golden Dragon, ur doing a WOW job! When I'm baffled with what to order, you come in at the right time and make life easier! Got to tell u, u ROCK!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-10T21:02:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-11T15:46:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000522564819","name":"Imran Bahadur"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"849555062","name":"Hira Aslam"},{"id":"1258402550","name":"Ateeka Ovais"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQ1MzkwMTMxMw\u003d\u003d","before":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"411511492233340","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Thanks for the lovely review and kind words.

WOW what a beautiful place - i am already a fan of your work and was once again loved the way you have created the lovely cozy yet spacious ambiance with 44.\n\nthe staff is courteous and helpful, polite and cheerful - always a good sign.\n\nthe food itself ranged from excellent to alright. first the excellent dishes\n\n1) the chicken mousse and rice cake starter - tiny bite-sized portions - lovely to start off a meal\n2) the bread basket - with a variety of breads - each fresh and very good - i didnt need the garlic butter - it was lovely to nibble of the buttery salty breadstix on their own and the toasted flat bread with flax seeds nice touch.\nall except 1 starter we ordered were on Aman's recommendation and i have decided to let him order for me in future \n3) the sea food trio - with smoked salmon stack, prawn cocktail with a spicy tomato based dip and grilled fish with a avocado salsa - very good - and beautifully presented\n4) The Prawn Gambas - out standing - have already gone into the buttery details of this on the pic - a MUST try for all prawn lovers\n5) THE WOK FRIED CRABS - OMG serious love happening - already apologized to Syed Ali Raza Abidi for this but i think the affair with the Goan Crabs is over for a while.\n6) the Cajun chicken Cesar salad - this is NOT my fav salad to begin with - am not a mayo fan - but from what i sampled - it was fresh and very vibrant in colors and textures - taste was pretty good - but i would never order this anywhere in the world\n\nthen came the entrees - (yes we eat a lot)\n7) Angle Hair pasta with scallops, mussels calamari prawns and fish - garnished with sun dried tomatoes and fresh parsley - the sea food was totally fresh and perfectly cooked, the dish seasoned well - the pasta was a bit over done for my palate but then i know many here who dont like el dente - so it can be quite bothersome for a chef.\n8) the beef tenderloin with tarragon - and chocolate balsamic reduction - was the biggest steak (we estimated it to be about 300 gms - but Aman said it was between 250-275gms) cooked to medium rare (thu unfortunately this was ordered Medium) - the reduction was amazing - smooth and silky, sweet and tangy and perfectly balanced with the char grilled beef and the herbs. if i am not stuffed with the Gambas and the crabs on my next visit - i am ordering this - and i like mt steaks medium rare.\n9) the Chicken and Beef Burgers - both were ok and presented well, one with home fries and one with the most amazing gratin - when there is so much other stuff to try i wont be ordering burgers at a place like 44\n10) the red thai curry with chicken and steamed rice - actually better than Fuchsias\n11) chicken roulade in pesto sauce - the presentation, the sauce and the sides were great - the chicken itself a little dry but definitely something that can be looked into and i would recommend that for all kukur lovers (which thankfully i am NOT)\n\nafter all this food - we had no space for dessert and were going to skip off for some healthy apple tea that Abid Aziz Merchant has brought back from Turkey but Aman wont hear of that and sent us the three desserts on the house. \n\n1) Creme Brulee - hands down the best in town - smooth, silky, velvety and the perfect crust on top. this is one the simplest desserts to make but it defeats many a chef.\n2) Chocolate Fondant  cake - perfectly made - rich and decadent\n3) Bread and Butter pudding - like Cesar salad and chicken another dish i rarely order anywhere - was different from ALL its cousins in town and was actually very nice - served with a yummy homemade banana ice-cream - this i loved and will have with a little chocolate sauce. and maybe fresh bananas and caramelized walnuts (see Aman here is a new dessert - simple and easy)\n\nover all experience - was FABULOUS - and i am going to re-inforce my statement about AMAN VIRJI becoming a culinary force to be reckoned with in the near future  \n\nThank you 44 team you have just become one of my top 10","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-23T14:43:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-25T14:25:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"100001692464184","name":"Amna Jatoi"},{"id":"697092175","name":"Mohammadi Kakal"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"1108385601","name":"Marvi Jatoi"},{"id":"509507958","name":"Omair Ahmed"},{"id":"777621756","name":"Masooma Dharamsey"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1288336373","name":"Muffi Halai"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

After being more than highly disappointed in the food at Baan Thai and Royal Elephant(at P.C), a friend & I decided to dine at Fuchsia for lunch today. My previous post on SWOT was about recommendations so as to make the dining experience worthwhile. A thanks goes out to all of you for taking out the time & putting in efforts (in the form of comments on that post) to provide recommendations & assist me in making valuable selections from the menu at the aforementioned restaurant.\n\nAt the entrance, we were given a warm welcome by the smiling staff who upon checking with our preference, lead us to our table on the ground floor, in the non-smoking area. Since it was a weekday, not too many diners had crowded the floor. Unlike many people out there, I like to eat at peace & do not prefer over crowded &/or noisy eateries. After finding ourselves comfortably seated at a corner table, our order for appetizers, main course & beverages was taken by a cooperative & friendly waiter. We ordered the Creamy Coconut Soup with straw mushroom & lime leaf. An assortment of add-on spices and sauces were served to spice it up according to our taste. For main course we ordered  Red Snapper with chilli tamarind oyster sauce & Red Curry Chicken with bamboo shoots and sweet basil. While we were enjoying the flavour packed soup, a group of 4 kittie party aunties arrived & were seated on the table for 8, next to our's. They hadn't even properly greeted eachother when the rat race of fashion & who-spent-how-much-on-which-nail-salon-this-week gossip began. Their gossip or the topic of discussion was none of my business ofcourse, had they not turned their get together into a fashion expenditure war when one of the wannabe girl-aunty started to boast 'n' brag soooo loudly that I had to request the staff to move us elsewhere & escape from that material-war in process before their remaining guests arrived. Yes I was expecting atleast a few ounces of speaking etiquettes & decent body language from them.\n In no time, we were shifted in the smoking area upstairs, since the stuck-up group had the entire restaurant involuntarily all ears to them. The staff didnot become annoyed with my request & infact, very happily served our meal at the new table. Our main course was served in a matter of only ten to fifteen minutes of placing the order.\n\nThe  red curry (with  rice) was divine, flavoursome, and wow! However, the fish failed to impress us. It was too stiff (not crisp), lacked freshness, was dry to the core & not actually something I would order next time or recommend to anyone. I didnot ask for a replacement or complain about it because I  tried it for the first time at this restaurant & felt maybe it was meant to look & taste like it did. When offered to fill out the comment card, I did provide a written honest feedback  about the fish not to be at par with my expectations/ liking. I felt that would suffice, along with complementing on the things I liked about Fuchsia.\n\nRestaurant  ambience was pleasant, staff were clad in smart,  clean uniforms, were very attentive & alert to the needs of diners & order timeliness was observed to be quite impressive!\n\nOverall a great experience! I look forward to visiting Fuchsia again to devour in the various other specialities of the 'loved' place.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-19T16:28:49+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-20T13:10:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzkyNDcwMTcw","before":"NjI1OTY4OTUz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"400766493307840","from":{"name":"Rabiya Syed","id":"1453901313"},"message":"You should have requested a replacement for the fish  immediately.Its normally very succulent,crisp on outside but really soft inside and its sauce is absolutely delicious!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-19T23:51:06+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400856599965496","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"Fuschia is one of my favouritist places ever!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T03:52:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400948083289681","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"@Rabiya Syed I thot of doing that first, then I thot shayad aisi hi hoti hogi, so didn't bother","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T09:36:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400948269956329","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"@Charmaine u were correct, the red curry was actually to die for!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T09:37:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401016543282835","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"I told you!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-20T13:10:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDAxMDE2NTQzMjgyODM1","before":"NDAwNzY2NDkzMzA3ODQw"}}},"restaurantName":"Fuchsia"},{"id":"165861103465048_400565956661227","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"Red snapper in chilli tamarind oyster sauce","type":"photo","created_time":"2012-06-19T16:40:35+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-19T17:58:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"506498832","name":"Tanya Akhund"},{"id":"707002154","name":"Sadia Khan"},{"id":"100000522564819","name":"Imran Bahadur"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNTIyNTY0ODE5","before":"NTA2NDk4ODMy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"400589336658889","from":{"name":"Najeeb Rehman","id":"749703456"},"message":"wow that looks good, miamiam..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-19T17:31:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400592226658600","from":{"name":"Shumyla Jawaid","id":"552006156"},"message":"Only if it tasted as good too.....:(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-19T17:37:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400595399991616","from":{"name":"Muneeza Kazi","id":"595441955"},"message":"Red snapper looks more like brown snapper.

So for the swotties specially those who are silent observers, I am repeating the list.  I've left out 5 of my favorites from this list namely Dynasty, Fujiyama, Pakistani & KababJi for the simple reason that these are not smoker friendly places and Pompei because of its location.

Reached around 2 pm finding out that there was only one table occupied on the ground floor with the mezzanine being an almost full house with one or two empty tables only.  Ordered beef red curry, chicken green curry, beef in oyster sauce and ginger chicken with black mushrooms.  All 4 items were served in differed kind of serving dishes that left a very bad first impression.  Both the curries were very bland and lacked the flavor that is usually associated with Thai food.  The remaining two dishes were quite watery again.  This is not expected from Fuchsia which I rated very highly when it came to Thai food and used to compare it with the restaurants in Bangkok.

I guess what made the overall experience even worse was realizing we've all had similar cuisine in Karachi which is more economical and also better tasting than the one served at Cafe 44.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-16T15:39:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe","type":"user","offset":0,"length":6}]},{"id":"278929285491562","from":{"name":"Sajida Ali","id":"1442271682"},"message":"I think most karachiites who try out 44 will swot it like sarah has done for a lot of reasons including the value for money factor and the bland taste factor.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-16T16:57:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"278942952156862","from":{"name":"Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi","id":"684515056"},"message":"i think its a really cheap way of making an extra buck for restaurants when they dont serve food with the essential sides.esp if these restaurants are expensive.  i mean, chicken stir fly has to have rice, the same way steak comes with veggies and a baked potato.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-16T17:25:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"278977968820027","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Sajida Ali:- The question of swotting after so much negatives is a tough one, the primarily objective of this SWOT page, and correct me if I am wrong is to improve standards and point out where things need to be and can be improved, if an employee is not doing his job properly that doesn't mean he is a bad person, its just means that he needs counseling and he needs to realignment his priorities. Bland food, value for money, a little extra, small things to complete a dish and personalized service are VERY IMPORTANT to make a new joint take off.My advice to restaurant owners is don't look at reaping back what you have sown the first day the restaurant opens, give it some time, twelve to eighteen months, give it your best shot, establish yourself in the market, address customer complaints, make changes and woo customers, who may be disgruntled and not completely satisfied. We have seen so many success stories, which had quite some negative reviews early, like CBG, like Olivetto, Okra, Cafe 9, The Deli, and many others, their owners and management took pains and worked hard to redefine their image and achieve success and carve a niche for themselves. The owners and operators of Cafe 44 and Xanders need to realize that Rome was certainly not conquered in one day and customer is the King, the only way that they can achieve success is continuous evolution and improvement. We can SWOT it anytime but the owners and management should commits to fine tuning and bring themselves up to the required level. I hope this topic stands concluded from critique point of view.
