The difference tonight was Irfan Malik's presence, who thanks to his love for Turkish food, designed the spectacular menu! And my God, he's a genius! The star of the evening was Kar???k Pide clubbed with Doner.. in easier terms, it was Turkish Pizza overloaded with a very generous serving of juicy Doner beef. This merger of two separate items was an off-the-menu brainchild of my husband and wow, I was blown away! The pizza even without the extra meat was scrumptious and crispy! The slivers of doner beef were tender, juicy with just enough flavour. \nThe rest of the meal included Ezogelin Soup (lentil soup), Durum Doner (doner wrap), and Soslu Tavuk (which is quite like Chicken Shashlik). The soup was a bit bland but the sauces helped. Durum Doner has become a personal favourite of mine. Soslu Tavuk was fantastic, although it may be considered as an acquired taste since I'm quite sure some lamb fat goes into it to give it that authentic flavour. \nAll in all, a very scrumptious and fulfilling meal it was, and my love for SOLEN has increased manifold!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-28T20:45:28+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-30T02:57:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"100000510679894","name":"Kanwal Hafeez"},{"id":"780381887","name":"Samar Husain"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"704566421","name":"Zubair Uddin"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"707220178","name":"Zohra Rajpar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzA3MjIwMTc4","before":"NTAxNDE1NzE2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"529520373765784","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Irfan Malik I know who to take when Shaikh Fawad convinces me to go to DMC for the Turkish meal.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-29T05:42:36+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"632567679","name":"Irfan Malik","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad","type":"user","offset":36,"length":12}]},{"id":"529520460432442","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Saira Malik the pics look yum and incredibly tempting","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-29T05:43:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"529544690430019","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"Pide with donner... we used to do that too...

Ordered a meal for one person (Chicken Yakatori on skewer, Egg fried rice with wontons). I am a uge fan of Mao, and order it at home but this meal was a let down. I guess they have economised for food court purposes - the meal was for Rs 399/- but it was not nice at all. It is a real challenge to take fine dining to fast food, but maybe they should have come into this market with a different name?
