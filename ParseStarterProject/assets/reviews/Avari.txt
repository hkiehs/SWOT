She is a fan of Chinese food. I am not here to write a review on their food. It just that it was the best dine out experience in karachi so far. The reason is the owner Mrs Maryam Chu was there and she is a very kind lady. Very professional the way she was personally taking care of the orders instructing the waiters what to do and confirming if the order was served completely was simply mind blowing.\n\nWe had a conversation with her for about 15 minutes and the way she personalized that conversation it really made us feel like the most important customers. This kind of hospitality is missing in other resturants and not just in karachi even in lahore. The only reason we are going to go back there is because of her. Keep up the good work. I just wish that other resturant owners/managers learn the art of proper customer services from her.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-08T17:22:29+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-09T20:59:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"592867967","name":"Saad Ahmed Shah"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"635183830","name":"Rashna Jaffer Shabbar"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"603100292","name":"Abbas Bootwala"},{"id":"3432614","name":"Shahfar Khan"},{"id":"739231013","name":"Aiya Quli"},{"id":"500846017","name":"Sheharyar Mujahid"},{"id":"1285044693","name":"Sami Ibrahim Tamimi"},{"id":"644290279","name":"Fariyah Khan"},{"id":"100000554344923","name":"Salman Khan Nizari"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"691650130","name":"Iqbal Sakrani"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"749604523","name":"Muhammad Umer Khan"},{"id":"704601576","name":"Sadia Azmat"},{"id":"1012804279","name":"Fahad Ashraf"},{"id":"100003468962483","name":"Sadaf Hamid"},{"id":"1205101053","name":"Misbah Vaid Rizwan Hussain"},{"id":"663526141","name":"Rizwana Shamim"},{"id":"100003526570035","name":"Gulshan Jindani"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"679713659","name":"Basit Iqbal Khan"},{"id":"1018862750","name":"Aye Sha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAxODg2Mjc1MA\u003d\u003d","before":"NTkyODY3OTY3"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_600319983352489/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTAxODg2Mjc1MA%3D%3D"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"600320953352392","from":{"name":"Muneeza Khan","id":"100005456923968"},"message":"we always go there for family dinner... love their food and their hospitality","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-08T17:25:30+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"600321253352362","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"Finally :-P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-08T17:26:34+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"600321276685693","from":{"name":"Numair Aftab","id":"555820205"},"message":"Not to forget the paan they give in the end","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-08T17:26:37+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"600321583352329","from":{"name":"Akbar Yezdani","id":"100001897462646"},"message":"Where is this place located?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-08T17:27:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"600321830018971","from":{"name":"Muneeza Khan","id":"100005456923968"},"message":"across jimmys at khadda market","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-08T17:28:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"600323956685425","from":{"name":"Khalid Saleem","id":"657031744"},"message":"Customer service at Lahore is absolutely horrific.

I was there for the 4pm show yesterday (iron man 3 3D). firstly they had they were out of nachos or had not started serving them as yet so they were unavailable , I ordered Mountain dew with caramel popcorn. the Drink was a mixture of everything (pepsi, miranda, Dew) so it tasted horrible and the popcorn were not up to the mark. \n\nwe went in and got seated getting the 3D glasses on the way , it turned out the glass was dirty and i requested for another one. this is where everything went south. I was given 25 pairs in the next 45 minutes and non of them were working either they were so dirty that you cant see properly or not working at all(CINEPAX has active 3D, so powered glasses) they felt more like night vision goggles with a green tint. \nFinally i had enough and i went out to speak to the management who offered me to sit through the 6.30 show which i didn't want to as it wasn't possible for me all the time they kept on convincing me that as it was a new cinema that just open i should be understandable that not everything was working in order. upon my protest i was told to contact them after the movie and make alternate arrangement. Finally in the end i was offered to be accommodated on any day of my choosing for the screening of the movie but now i am having second thoughts as to whether i should go back and watch the movie with stale popcorn or splash a few more bucks and visit atrium instead..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-27T19:28:07+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-28T08:06:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100005246919211","name":"Sami Hashmi"},{"id":"100004957325068","name":"Uzma Ash"},{"id":"517243075","name":"Annie Ali"},{"id":"1014052691","name":"Natasha Arif"},{"id":"100000424156000","name":"Afza Khan"},{"id":"100000170759285","name":"Abbas Sajjani"},{"id":"739231013","name":"Aiya Quli"},{"id":"1551738621","name":"Syed Yousuf A?idi"},{"id":"720924223","name":"Ayeshah Farooq"},{"id":"100004072783257","name":"Rija Ahmed"},{"id":"505580927","name":"Nabil Babar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA1NTgwOTI3","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"562968297087658","from":{"name":"Nabil Babar","id":"505580927"},"message":"agreed.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-27T19:31:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"562973800420441","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Well after this, im cancelling my plans for sure ..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-27T19:48:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"562974953753659","from":{"name":"Haseeb Qamar","id":"502813985"},"message":"honestly i would want them to fix things and fast cause it can be alot better and i have a free ticket :D.. i bet 2D would still be enjoyable but  if you are planning to watch iron man than go to atrium","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-27T19:51:41+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"562976720420149","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Atrium is too far.

Not being charged for the bad item(s), not being charged for that full meal and a future meal, etc.?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-16T11:23:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-16T18:44:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001478637910","name":"Anum Naeem"},{"id":"1473431885","name":"Syed Aamir Bukhari"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"594302255","name":"Feroze Jamall"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"711705428","name":"Basit Nasir Ahmed"},{"id":"786471893","name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nzg2NDcxODkz","before":"MTAwMDAxNDc4NjM3OTEw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"398804590170697","from":{"name":"Waqas Tariq","id":"1088744265"},"message":"Not being charged for anything that's 'not eatable' for everything else an apology should suffice.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T11:30:23+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"398814250169731","from":{"name":"Abbas Bootwala","id":"603100292"},"message":"which confuses me.at a point where one party(restaurant) claims that the food is perfectly ok and the customer claiming it to be absolutely un  edible who will give the final verdict!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T12:03:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"398818153502674","from":{"name":"Faiza M.

We happen to go to China kitchen some time back for which I had made a reservation in advance. When we go there, I was told that we could not be accommodated inside where we were initially booked for and the only option was to sit out side. It was not a matter of sitting outside but the way the hostess put it was, take it or leave it. There was someone already sitting on then table apparently waiting for their table inside. Our guests started to arrive so we decided to just take the table. The setup was actually thrown on the table, without actually being. The way they  took the order was if we had done a favor coming to the restaurant. The food was very average - Dynasty @ Avari is still the best and there is no comparison. Anyway the dinner ended and as I drove off, I realized the I realized the left hand mirror on the door had been ripped and stolen. I called the restaurant back when I reached home I was spoke to the hostess who said to send her the bill for the repairs.  After having the mirror repaired thru the insurance i took the bill for balance payments as insurance companies deduct for depreciation. At the restaurant the hostess simply refused to accommodate as she says it was on the slip when I had the car valet parked that it was on my own risk. Her attitude was again rude and arrogant. Something which I should I have expected as she showed it the day we went there for dinner. I just took the bill back and walked out. While I do understand that cars are parked at owners risk, there is still a duty of care the owners are supposed to provide. She did mention that they have tried to remove the druggies from around the neighborhood who could have possibly stolen, but it was not there fault. Since then I have decided not to go there. I thought of posting this earlier but decided against it. The new restaurants, and the look restaurants must remember the first thing about hospitality it's customer service.  Even if you want to say no, they must learn to say it politely  .","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-20T15:46:50+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-21T12:12:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"780833634","name":"Erum Ahmed"},{"id":"654298693","name":"Huma Akhter Mundia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjU0Mjk4Njkz","before":"NzgwODMzNjM0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"382920588425764","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"And this is why I won't be goin bak to CK for a long long time.....and if I did...it prob be a favor to them.

When people started being negative about Aylanto, I wanted to give them another chance to see if it was really that bad now. Our first experience at the new place was a C+ so I could not understand the horrible reviews they were getting. So, being a glutton for punishment, I took Mariyam Masood there for lunch today. Sigh, what can I say that it was a complete and utter disappointment! First, the positives. Good greeting at the door, polite waiters, cold water, fresh bread and courteous damage control. Unfortunately that is where it stops! Ordered the French Onion soup which actually was not too bad the last time but microscopic cheese on two pieces of french bread thrown in at the last minute so they were hard. When I sent it back, because at the time of the order I specified that I wanted it to be smothered in melting cheese, it returned with some additional grated but unmelted cheese. Strike One! Mariyam's Tarragon Chicken, which she loved at the old Aylanto, was two skinny pieces of chicken unable to really remain juicy or retain flavour. Strike Two! My steak was ordered medium rare and came medium well. Was replaced with one that was more like medium but by then I did not want to waste any more time or food and dutifully ate the average tasting steak. Strike Three! To their credit, one of their managers came to check when he had been told I was unhappy with our food and I shared my concerns with him. He was very apologetic and despite my repeated requests to the contrary, removed the soup and steak from the bill ... which made me very uncomfortable since that was not my intent in speaking with him. I told him that they really need to focus on their food if they are to stem the negative tide and he was receptive to the feedback. He requested that we return and he would personally take charge of our orders. However, unfortunately that is not what we want from any restaurant. Sure, people do take care of us at places we go to but then that is in their nature for ALL their customers, not just us.

When people started being negative about Aylanto, I wanted to give them another chance to see if it was really that bad now. Our first experience at the new place was a C+ so I could not understand the horrible reviews they were getting. So, being a glutton for punishment, I took Mariyam Masood there for lunch today. Sigh, what can I say that it was a complete and utter disappointment! First, the positives. Good greeting at the door, polite waiters, cold water, fresh bread and courteous damage control. Unfortunately that is where it stops! Ordered the French Onion soup which actually was not too bad the last time but microscopic cheese on two pieces of french bread thrown in at the last minute so they were hard. When I sent it back, because at the time of the order I specified that I wanted it to be smothered in melting cheese, it returned with some additional grated but unmelted cheese. Strike One! Mariyam's Tarragon Chicken, which she loved at the old Aylanto, was two skinny pieces of chicken unable to really remain juicy or retain flavour. Strike Two! My steak was ordered medium rare and came medium well. Was replaced with one that was more like medium but by then I did not want to waste any more time or food and dutifully ate the average tasting steak. Strike Three! To their credit, one of their managers came to check when he had been told I was unhappy with our food and I shared my concerns with him. He was very apologetic and despite my repeated requests to the contrary, removed the soup and steak from the bill ... which made me very uncomfortable since that was not my intent in speaking with him. I told him that they really need to focus on their food if they are to stem the negative tide and he was receptive to the feedback. He requested that we return and he would personally take charge of our orders. However, unfortunately that is not what we want from any restaurant. Sure, people do take care of us at places we go to but then that is in their nature for ALL their customers, not just us. Overall, being a charitable person, I hope that they can return to the standards of yesteryear because at the moment, I find it very hard to point myself in the direction of Aylanto again. And that is a damn shame since I did enjoy my occasional visits there.

Mc Donalds, Hardees and imported fries are industrious products and have their peculiar tastes that we are all hooked to. (I have a MD session at least once every 10 days). But the taste of a fresh burger and fries is a different ball game and can not be compared. Personal likings aside someone like you who knows his food, this is a little hard for me to digest. Would love to be educated and would also invite you to try the fires at Loginn (I will personally do them for you) without a bias and may be I get convinced.

Over the years, and please feel free to correct me if I am wrong, I feel that fries made fresh seem to sometimes turn out a little sweet, maybe owing to the quality of potatoes or otherwise. I have noticed this in fries made in my home also. This is, ofcourse, a personal opinion and I am sure there are many exceptions to this, such as yourself. Also, the imported fries are an indulgence for me and I quite enjoy the personal decadence. But, in all fairness, I will also add that I love good food but I can't cook / fry / boil anything myself so maybe its a technical thing. As far as any fresh food goes, nothing out of a packet or a box can compare to it so I will agree with you wholeheartedly on your view.
