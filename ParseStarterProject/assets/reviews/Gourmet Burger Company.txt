Had all four of them, tried shack's full house double patty today. Rank:\n\n1st. MYOB, amazing burger, half pounder is the best yet. Quantity and quality with value for money.\n\n2nd. Fat burger, had it a long time back but I remember the beef patty was perfect. However not value for money.\n\n3rd. The burger shack, had it today, full house and original double patty. Full house beef patty is really soft and for 380 it's a good deal. However, one double burger isn't very filling\n\n4th. Big thick. I personally didn't like it cuz of the desi touch in it's beef, tasted like kaleji :/ not good.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-20T18:10:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-23T13:13:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"286700230","name":"Umair Shafi Afzal"},{"id":"546027973","name":"Abdul Ahad Saud"},{"id":"509254105","name":"Syed Sohaib Kazmi"},{"id":"750786806","name":"Faixa Shah"},{"id":"512822643","name":"Saad Yusoof"},{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"668684459","name":"Fawad Siddiqui"},{"id":"1300089148","name":"Danish Noor"},{"id":"516138880","name":"Salik Aleem"},{"id":"574052713","name":"Harun Aziz"},{"id":"607781828","name":"Zoobia Azam"},{"id":"621305514","name":"Aniqa Imran"},{"id":"827180267","name":"DrJoyo Tabsheer"},{"id":"535065551","name":"Hassan Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTM1MDY1NTUx","before":"Mjg2NzAwMjMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"606686179382536","from":{"name":"Myob PK","id":"100006282282628"},"message":"Great to hear!

So far, the online part was smooth even if it turned out to be inaccurate when they called me to confirm the order since it was the first one. The phone call was a little less encouraging but being an optimist, I am trying to remain positive and reserving judgement till the food arrives. \n\nThe problems I had were that the listed delivery charge was 100 and I was informed that since the food is delivered from Sindhi Muslim, it would be 200. When I pointed out that their order confirmation online should state the proper charge, I was informed that they have mentioned that delivery chargers can vary by area. Sure they can, but when you have my address including the area I live in, how hard is it to program your computer to reflect the actual delivery charge rather than have to call and check with me if I am willing to pay the extra 100 bucks. \n\nI was also informed that even though the online system lists the estimated time at 60 minutes, it would be up to 90 minutes. Again, I ask why the system is not accurate? The whole point of an online system is defeated if I need to provide decisions on the phone because then I might as well call them rather than waste my time online!\n\nFinally, while completely polite, the person on the phone was defensive and almost using an argumentative tone ... not sure how to describe it any better than that! Let's just say that I wasn't thinking how often I would order from Urbanite; rather I was thinking if I had made a mistake and should cancel. Unfortunately, Mariyam Masood wanted some mushroom soup and so my delivery options were limited so I figured I would see how this experience panned out even though I am not very hopeful!\n\nHowever, to be fair, I shall comment further once the food arrives ... hopefully well before 90 minutes because that would make it 11pm!

Two thumbs up as usual! Though Aali Qayoom felt the Chili Con Carne should carry a serving of Doritos which it presently does not. Sohail had the Gourmet Classic Mushroom Burger and was completely enamored of it! It was certainly love at first bite! It?s easy to see why. There?s a genuinely healthy beef pattie inside and makes for large and juicy morsels. Believe me size matters when you?re hungry! Too often we get a bun wherein there is a faint hint of a pattie, and the french fries are limp and soggy. But the French fries that accompanied the Gourmet Classic Mushroom Burger were crisp and thick, and of good size. \n\nFinally there was the Gourmet Italian Grilled Chicken Burger that I had ordered for myself. Aali had taken a generous mouthful of the Gourmet Classic Mushroom Burger with the beef pattie, and said the chicken pattie in the Gourmet Italian Grilled Chicken Burger was a bit insipid after that. Tasted fine to me, and man was I hungry after an extended session with spiked grape fruit juice! As far as I am concerned GBC passed the test with flying colours, and this not based on the meal I had tonight. Last night I had ordered the Gourmet Classic Burger that professed to be prime ground beef flame grilled to perfection. It went down just fine, and my tummy coped quite well, and my morning interface with Nature was quite pleasant! The reason I mention this aspect is because up-market Karachi food is prone to hit the wrong chords with me more often than I care for. GBC food and I are entering a comfort zone.
