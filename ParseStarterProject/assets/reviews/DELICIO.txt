Fattoush Salad: must clarify all \"preconceived notions\" aside, the fattoush was as authentic as i have loved it for 18 years, until.... the pomegranite juice sweetness kicks in. Thank heavens its a mild presence so of the entire bowl the sweetness hit in bare few bites instead of a presence in the entire salad. Which means whenever there was no pomegranite juice (which fell to the base of the bowl\n: proving it was fresh juice) the salad was DELICIOUS.  \n\n2. Gourmet Fries: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10151603200767065&set\u003dpb.185841542064.-2207520000.1365953466&type\u003d3&theater  now when i saw this picture posted on Thursday the temptation to hit LP multiplied. I dont know why, my folly or the \"seeing is not believing\" or \"aankhon ka dhoka\" for some odd reason i thought the image portrayed curly fries. They weren't . they were typical fries which LP's next door neighbour serves. the fries had a sprinkle of turkey bacon chips, a drizzle of cheese/ white sauce and bare greens. Erm. Again. i was only disappointed because i was expecting teh picture. To have a platterful of fries is, otherwise, never a complaint. \n\n3. Banh Mi: The Vietnamese Sandwich. The sandwich was lovely, slightly bland, and quite tasty ONLY till you were not expecting a \"vietnamese\" flavour. now. I love Far Eastern Food, and Vietnamese and Thai are among favourites. i may not be a chef, but i know my flavours. and Sadly. Tthis sandwich, delicious as it was, lacked two things:\ni. original vietnamese flavour. could taste no sweetness/ saltiness/ sour acidity or anything. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_cuisine. it lacked flavour. period. if ntohing, it essentially needed lemon and chilli punch, and some spring onions. \nthe baguette was filled with very moist melt-in-your-mouth chicken pieces, plenty of coriander leaves, some mayo and other julienned veggies. On its own, without the \"vietnamese\" description it was good. quite good. except for the lack of vietnamese flavour and well.. teh sad second thing im about to point out:\nii: first bite you take and you can get an aroma and flavour. a flavour we all know very well. the biggest sadness: the bread/ baguette tasted like a pure bun kebab bun. \n\nBut without the description (bun kebab flavour of baguette notwithstanding) the sandwich was quite nice, on its own. the feta cheese salad on the side with cherry tomatoes: too refreshing. just yum. \n\n4. Drinks: DELIGHTFUL. i. Love absolutely love the diner sized glasses and helpings. The Cold Coffee/ Coffee Frappe was marvellous. A perfect blend of chilled, creamy but not rich or heavy, flavoured aromatic coffee and thickness was just beautiful. The other drink: Raspberry Lime was simply pure summer drink. \n\nOverall:\n-  the helpings are rather, just a tinsy winsy bit, small for the prices. fattoush salad for 375 is a bit steep, as was the fries for 280 with the toppings (to make them gourmet they need a lot more). sandwich for 450 was also slightly small, but similar prices are offered at other eateries so... thats quite a few who need to get teh price-quantity element right. \n- Presentation was good. Im still jaw dropped at teh diner feel of the drinks. lovely tall milkshake diner glasses. for 300 and 330 and the punch of flavour its all so delightful.  fries came on a platter. sandwich came on a thick wooden board atop butterpaper. \n\nwill i go back? hell yeah for those drinks and the fattoush: oh yeah.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-14T15:53:56+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T16:55:30+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"620145354","name":"Bina Saeed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjIwMTQ1MzU0","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"540184456032709","from":{"name":"Bina Saeed","id":"620145354"},"message":"im hungry","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-14T16:00:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"550141611703660","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"here you go Madiha Sultan Tai","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-29T16:55:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"24440","name":"Madiha Sultan Tai","type":"user","offset":12,"length":17}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTUwMTQxNjExNzAzNjYw","before":"NTQwMTg0NDU2MDMyNzA5"}}},"restaurantName":"DELICIO"},{"id":"165861103465048_544783245572830","from":{"name":"Nazeeha Khan","id":"100000184402955"},"message":"SUMMER DRINKS\nIndulge in an entirely new summer drink experience AT My Secret Bakes - Nazeeha Khan\nTUEESDAY 23rd April, Who thought summers could be so refreshing.

I'm emphasizing on the quantities because i'd been hearing complaints about their small quantities, so was pleasantly surprised to see that was not the case. Maybe Alexandre Rizvi has taken everyones suggestions into consideration. The Prawn sandwich was flawless! Absolutely juicy and FRESH!      Now THE BAD - pls add a few more croutons in the ceaser salad (mine had a total of 3). My friend ordered the pumpkin waffle..... which only had a teaspoon of pumkin mash on it.
