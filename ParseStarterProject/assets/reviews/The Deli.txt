To my surprise, in less than hour after I commented, I got a phonecall from a Food Panda manager by the name of Haya, who was very apologetic and sincere, and repeatedly said that she hoped I'd try Food Panda again and not have any complaints this time. I was pretty impressed by their diligence so today, I decided to give FP another chance. I ordered two sandwiches from Petaco's via FP, my total bill was Rs. 755. I gave the rider exactly Rs. 780, and instead of giving me Rs. 5 change, he asks for Rs. 50 more. I'm very dreamy-minded and tend to miss the obvious so I checked the bill, and asked why I had to give Rs. 50 more. The rider then says that those Rs. 50 charges are for HIS delivery. Like, I already paid Rs. 100 for delivery, but the rider gets a special Rs. 50 tip. I called up FP and they picked up after MUCH delay. Thankfully I wasn't passed from one rep to another, they were prompt in getting someone to talk to me and I explained what was going on. The rep apologized and said I didn't need to pay any more amount at all and he'd call the rider and speak to him. The rider didn't even return the Rs. 5 he owed me, btw. And I know the trolls will be commenting here saying its just Rs. 5, etc. but I'm more pissed off on an ethical level. This was my third time ordering from Food Panda and honestly, one or two hiccup here and there is normal, I've had them with Urbanite as well but this is just the limit! If anyone is thinking of trying out Food Panda, DON'T! At least Urbanite will respond to you and apologize and their bad hiccups happen once or twice. Food Panda hiccups with each order, and the severity of their problems only increases with each incident.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-12T16:07:07+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-14T21:11:29+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1324057559","name":"Safi Ahmed"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1497320748","name":"Fauzia Farhan Hashmat"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"507563555","name":"Sara Omran"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"783958571","name":"Rabia Rajput"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"1406140922","name":"Sufyan Khan"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"100004754324237","name":"Usman Kabir"},{"id":"554875549","name":"Imran Siddiqui"},{"id":"882650316","name":"Sabah Shaikh"},{"id":"100001565357082","name":"Sinan Charania"},{"id":"605974561","name":"Aneeba F.

The khowsuey, although quite different from the regular sort, was absolutely scrumptious! Tangy and spicy. Probably just needed some more papri for the crunch factor.. And since it was stir-fried, i didn't expect it to be overly creamy. The khowsuey was accompanied by two separately packed sauces: one was chilli oil, and the other was a yellow coloured sauce/ gravy, which I thought would be coconut curry, but wasn't and in fact was too bland to decipher what it could be. Other than a tablespoon or so of oil floating at the base of the box (only visible when I was finishing the khowsuey), the meal was wholesome and fantastic.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-07T05:39:22+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-07T05:46:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"374387502612406","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"i LOVEEEE deli's stir fry!!! its yum!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-07T05:46:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzc0Mzg3NTAyNjEyNDA2","before":"Mzc0Mzg3NTAyNjEyNDA2"}}},"restaurantName":"The Deli"},{"id":"165861103465048_368388639878959","from":{"name":"Taf Cochin","id":"562955644"},"message":"Aylanto - 021 35309868 / 021 35309869\nCafe 76- 021 35833163 / 021 35833164\nCafe Flo - 021 35877498 / 021 35877499\nCafe Blue Ginger - 021 35370861/021 35370862\nChairman Mao - 021 35853333 / 021 35837777\nChina Kitchen - 021 35860184 / 0333 2209169\nChopstix Chinese - 021 35340584 / 021 35340585\nDomino's - 021 111 366 466\nEspresso Delivery - 021 111 393 377\nEspresso Shahbaz - 021 35342725 / 021 35347272\nEspresso Zamzama - 021 35824007\nForty4 - 021 35290065 / 021 35290066\nFuchsia - 021 35363944 / 021 35363948\nGinsoy - 021 3545362 / 021 35345363\nGrilled Chilliz - 021 35847651 / 021 35847652\nGolden Dragon - 021 35483900/ 0321 2172166\nKamameshi - 021 35304257 / 021 35304258\nLog inn Lounge - 021 35378790 / 0300 2020211\nNandos - 021 111 626 367\nOcean Bucket - 0321 2659965\nOkra - 021 35831350 / 021 35866616\nOlivetto - 021 34222955/ 0332 8222855\nPizza Hut - 021 111 241 241\nPompei - 021 35214684 / 021 35219657\nThe Deli - 021 35838954\nThe Diner - 021 35854581 / 021 35854582\nThe Patio -   021 35309871 / 0300 8291936\nThyme Restaurant - 0300 9211901 / 0321 9211901\nUpper Crust - 021 111 35 36 37 / 021 35861415\nXander's - 021 35293653 / 021 35293654 / 0322 9037777.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-04-28T10:40:14+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-06T11:18:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"850315404","name":"Faiza Nathani Sagheer"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"},{"id":"515193342","name":"Mesam Akhter"},{"id":"622773736","name":"Muffasar Malik"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"723007812","name":"Ronny Byramji"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"1116585313","name":"Pervez Daredia"},{"id":"613037941","name":"Faiza Afzal"},{"id":"1039048992","name":"Camilla Asmatullah"},{"id":"586005404","name":"Abid Nisar"},{"id":"648625693","name":"Alizeh Hashim"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"100000519917560","name":"Fizza Shahid"},{"id":"708482342","name":"Saba Basit"},{"id":"553372446","name":"Sameera Zahid"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"746190586","name":"Hussain M Raza"},{"id":"726690443","name":"Danial Rizvi"},{"id":"594934104","name":"Soobia Rehman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTk0OTM0MTA0","before":"ODQ3Mjg1NTcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"368393759878447","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"B is missing from your list ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-04-28T10:45:15+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false},{"id":"368395549878268","from":{"name":"Danial Rizvi","id":"726690443"},"message":"Wow helpful much.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-04-28T10:46:06+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"368403006544189","from":{"name":"Khalid Lakhani","id":"711077848"},"message":"Taf..

A pretty neat idea - an alternative to heavy lunches we usually have. There was ample food for everyone. However, there is a little room for improvement. For starters, they can introduce the open-face sandwich for diet-conscious people in brown bread. Overall two thumbs up.

They somehow were adament on removing plates before we could finish our food and were bending over our heads to do so. We complained multiple times but no use. In starters, the calamari was stale and not crunchy as usual, the salads lacked seasoning and were dry, only wontons were the saviours. In main course, the spicy lemon fish was bland, the shrimps were overcooked, the glass noodles tasted really odd with only dominant red chilli flavour, spicy red chicken & sweet & sour chicken were only decent entrees.

It came in a small rectangular plate without a side. So we ordered steamed rice separately which came in a bowl that held at most 5 tablespoons of cooked rice, which was disappointing again. The stir fry along with the steamed rice tasted fine but then again it was nothing to write home about. Everyone I went with had a problem with the portion size and some of the food tasted bland as well so we eventually left feeling unfulfilled, disgruntled and hungry.

Bland food, value for money, a little extra, small things to complete a dish and personalized service are VERY IMPORTANT to make a new joint take off.My advice to restaurant owners is don't look at reaping back what you have sown the first day the restaurant opens, give it some time, twelve to eighteen months, give it your best shot, establish yourself in the market, address customer complaints, make changes and woo customers, who may be disgruntled and not completely satisfied. We have seen so many success stories, which had quite some negative reviews early, like CBG, like Olivetto, Okra, Cafe 9, The Deli, and many others, their owners and management took pains and worked hard to redefine their image and achieve success and carve a niche for themselves. The owners and operators of Cafe 44 and Xanders need to realize that Rome was certainly not conquered in one day and customer is the King, the only way that they can achieve success is continuous evolution and improvement. We can SWOT it anytime but the owners and management should commits to fine tuning and bring themselves up to the required level. I hope this topic stands concluded from critique point of view.
