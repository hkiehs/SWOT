There are four types of pizza.  The fancy ultra thin crust 'authentic' pizza baked in a brick oven, with some olives, and just a bit of rosemary on top.  The international franchise pizza, which is either loaded with oil, or majorly lacks consistency.  There is the me-too pizza.  And then there is Miss Hen, serving the classic desi-ized version of pizza, loaded with cheese and your choice of meat.  No nonsense.  Just a delicious pizza, probably the best around if one is looking for that greasy pizza full of flavor.  Lets call it the Johari Deep Pan.\n\nMost would not be aware of Miss Hen, unless they have spent some time at the IBA Main Campus, or live in NA-253.  The pizza just has insane amount of topping, and is full of flavor.  It may not be the most pleasant looking pizza, but tastes bloody amazing, and beats any of these available fancy pizzas by a mile, at a fraction of cost.\n\nHighly Recommended for those who are willing to experiment.\n\nOverall Rating -- 8.5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-13T20:54:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-14T12:55:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"777000220","name":"Ata Ur Rehman"},{"id":"513059748","name":"Tracy Roque"},{"id":"519570353","name":"Khushboo Zahra"},{"id":"100003533323814","name":"Sarah Muhammad"},{"id":"546027973","name":"Abdul Ahad Saud"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1547568629","name":"Danish Khan"},{"id":"100001177844959","name":"Sameer Siddiqui"},{"id":"838344921","name":"Wajeeh Hasan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"591166408","name":"Faisal M.

So we walked in asked if they could accommodate us, they said yes but since all the waiters were also Muslim there will be a slight delay in the food. But we were given the Iftar platter ie dates and water immediately. What put us off was that the place was under construction, with broken walls and area not cordoned off. And the service after the acceptable 15 mins was abysmal. The food was average. Worse was the attitude of the people managing the desk. And take outs. Some poor driver had been waiting over 30 mins for his order, and was not given an Iftar platter to open his roza, and they way he was spoken to was atrocious.

The owner insisted that I should have the Cheese Naan fresh from the Tandoor rather than doing a takeaway.  Had it fresh from the Tandoor, 20 minutes wait so the Naan could be prepared and boy it was so good that I decided to scrap the idea of takeaway and asked the owner to serve me the Qeema Naan also there.  The freshly baked Qeema Naan (available in both mutton and chicken) is probably the best available anywhere in town.  He also suggested at that I should try the Croissant Naan ( this will go great dipped in a karak doodhpatti).  Also tried a Aaloo Naan which was also terrific (picture posted) with a lovely filling of green masala and chillies with potatoes.  Highly recommend Bread Basket for the variety of Kulchas, Naans and Desi type bakery items like Baakar Khaani and Khattai.   Bread Basket, you've found a new loyal customer.

Finally found the old waiters there, in a different uniform: Al-Rehman Chaat: opened next to Flamingo.\n\nordered Mixed Chaat & Meethi Dahi Puri from Flamingo.\nMasala Dossa and Aloo Masala from Cool-Inn\nAloo Chholay and Bun Kebab from Al-Rehman (the waiters insisted. they did serve us for over 12 years. i had to give it a go)\n\nFlaimngo's mixed chaat: its my favourite. a very good balance of meethi, khatti and hari chutney with dahi. flaws: they use very low amounts of yogurt and given inflationary pressures of prices of channas coupled with their prices people are willing to pay: the chollas are no longer kabuli. as a result they usually tend to be hard at the centre. Ive always had to ask for extra yogurt and then have had to resend it for pouring some more in. but the flavour is still the best i've had of all places. \n\nMasala Dossa: its grown! i guess Mirchi took some clientelle away. and more loaded too this time! i didnt taste much curry leaves this time or mustard seed but it was still piping hot and crisp and massive!\n\nAloo Masala: erm. no. i make better. and ive had better from this baba who use to bring a small cooking pot filled with aloo masala from home next to Rainbow Centre. his were divine. i think he passed away. and i tried to recreate his at home. but his were the best. that thing about cooking with love? must've been it. used to make a very small quantity but it was absolutely spot onn the flavour you've heard of.\n\nUnfair of me to compare Cool-Inns with baba's. so why? well simpy cuz these aloo masala  from Cool Inn were big and chunky: the way they're supposed to be. but. the masala is kooti lal mirchi in not-very-bhunna hua tomato sauce. Masala needs to be well bhunna hua. if not it just tastes undone. and thats what cool-inn's was. i'll ignore it didnt have tamarind and thank heavens for autumn and flavourful coriander leaves otherwise i bet in teh summers id have flat flavoured coriander. \n\nnow Al-Rehman. \nbun kebabs were perfectly desi. thank God they asked if i wanted the typical or the one with ketchup and cole slaw: ICK!!! no no was good old desi egg-mashed lentil with onions and green chutney for me. moist. yum. desi bun kebab. you cant talk about theier flavours. no. not in words. you can just enjoy them. \n\naloo chholay: very home -made flavour. so i like\n\nthe one thing about alll three places today; everything was piping hot! i havent had that in sometime. \n\nall in all: chaat. and simply yum!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-11T15:13:10+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-11T15:49:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"892195391","name":"Tehreem Fatima"},{"id":"575820034","name":"Maheen Kamran"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3Mjg3Mzkz","before":"MTIxMzYzNzA4Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"458957674155388","from":{"name":"Saifullah Mazhar","id":"517287393"},"message":"What a review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-11T15:49:43+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDU4OTU3Njc0MTU1Mzg4","before":"NDU4OTU3Njc0MTU1Mzg4"}}},"restaurantName":"Mirchi"},{"id":"165861103465048_458098217574667","from":{"name":"Rehan Moosa","id":"660568444"},"message":"Dahi Batata Puri ... the perfect combination of meethi dahi puri with taiz hari and lal chutney ... only at Mirchi - Chaat & More","type":"photo","created_time":"2012-11-09T08:57:20+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-09T13:30:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"685735173","name":"Zainab Parvez"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"1292708984","name":"Arshnoor Moosa"},{"id":"585622689","name":"Naveed Ismail"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk0MjM4NzQy","before":"Njg1NzM1MTcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"458120267572462","from":{"name":"Nayyer Rauf","id":"888075011"},"message":"Yummy I want this","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-09T10:51:14+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"458157610902061","from":{"name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi","id":"543651722"},"message":"Nayyer baji send me some too plzzz...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-11-09T13:30:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"888075011","name":"Nayyer","type":"user","offset":0,"length":6}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDU4MTU3NjEwOTAyMDYx","before":"NDU4MTIwMjY3NTcyNDYy"}}},"picture":"http://photos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/400363_10151149731173445_596059285_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10151149731173445&set\u003dgm.458098217574667&type\u003d1&relevant_count\u003d1","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif","restaurantName":"Mirchi"},{"id":"165861103465048_452327838151705","from":{"name":"Faisal Naseer","id":"780902784"},"message":"Where does one get the best achaars from?

Golden Dragon - My new love for Thai and Chinese food. Hot favourites: American Chopsuey, Crispy Beef, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Hot and Sour Soup, Thai Soup, Thai Green Curry, Wontons, Zingers and Chicken Karhai (the last two from their Lunch Xpress section)\n\n2. Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb's warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I'm not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away. Will go soon to be blown away by other things too.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-25T18:59:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-27T14:47:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"505164013","name":"Yasmeen Agad-Kothawala"},{"id":"515396294","name":"Danish Ali Dahraj"},{"id":"100003249618202","name":"Heer Ahmed"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"500907007","name":"Murtaza Moiz"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNjUxNzIy","before":"NjU3MDMxNzQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"404073356310487","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"i see myself featured here too, obliged and humbled Hajra Amir","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T19:33:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir","type":"user","offset":52,"length":10}]},{"id":"404123489638807","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Thank you Hajra :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T21:13:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra","type":"user","offset":10,"length":5}]},{"id":"404386042945885","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"These places are on my fingertips 24/7!!!
