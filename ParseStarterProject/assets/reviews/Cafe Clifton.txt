In addition to giving the hotel wala money to give out food to the needy, he has a parchi system :). If someone walks upto him asking for money for food or he sees someone who can use a meal, he simply gives him a parchi with his signature on it. The person takes it to the hotel, hands over the parchi and has his meal. At the end of the month he goes to the hotel, gets his bill (along with parchis as receipts) and he pays for the meals. He has preset meals for a parchi. It could work with any chai paratha hotel we have in our vicinity.
