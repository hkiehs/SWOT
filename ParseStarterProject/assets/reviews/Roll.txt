Around 8 o clock, I received another call from the owner of WOK who showed great concern about the issue and wanted to send something complimentary to make up for the food sent earlier. He even asked what time specifically I would like to have my meal. I really appreciate this gesture because it shows that they really value their customers.\n\nThe food was delivered on time and was hot. The packaging was good and serving size was very generous. The food was very decent in taste this time specifically the Fish and Egg Fried Rice were very good. The only flaw was that there was no salt in the Vegetable Rolls whereas the Almond Chicken had a bit too much of salt.

We ordered dry beef chillie, chicken chowmein, prawn balls, kungpao chicken, american chopsuey and sweet and sour chicken. Everything was uber delicious esp the chowmein, prawnballs and beef chillie dry. Prawn balls were lovely golden, crispy from the outside, soft with prawn chunks inside. Not doughy/chewy, instead melted in the mouth. Beef was perfectly stir fried, succulent and v tender. Order time was apparently 1.5 hrs but was delivered in 50 mins. The best part is its relatively more reasonable and good value for home delivered chinese. Was delivered piping hot. Definitely ordering again.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-30T19:19:13+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-30T22:12:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"673105463","name":"Fatima Baig"},{"id":"787375286","name":"Zain Rauf"},{"id":"1013410116","name":"Lailumah Shah - Nasar"},{"id":"614605531","name":"Asad Saeed"},{"id":"717445135","name":"Rukaiya Karim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"544715226","name":"Sairah Khalid"},{"id":"732665092","name":"Mariam Bandukda"},{"id":"666015726","name":"Aina Zulfiqar"},{"id":"509568517","name":"Beenish Ehsan"},{"id":"688715909","name":"Ahmad Owais"},{"id":"854755191","name":"Suhana Sami"},{"id":"100002668207268","name":"Dania Faisal Tai"},{"id":"100001147081526","name":"Hasan Ijaz"},{"id":"562646030","name":"Hina Mukarram"},{"id":"512384381","name":"Mariam Khatri"},{"id":"526706972","name":"Mazuin Zulfiqar"},{"id":"512612823","name":"Leena Faruqui"},{"id":"631490154","name":"Nadia Patel.Gangjee"},{"id":"667165223","name":"Hamna Furqan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY3MTY1MjIz","before":"NjczMTA1NDYz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"578705588847262","from":{"name":"Faryal Naqvi","id":"739670623"},"message":"love golden dragon","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-30T19:21:16+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"578705798847241","from":{"name":"Hamna Furqan","id":"667165223"},"message":"yummmyy......farva u got me hungry!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-30T19:22:13+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"578706712180483","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Karim","id":"502158910"},"message":"1.5 hours POOF!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-30T19:25:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"578707062180448","from":{"name":"Farv?

While the yummy food is still on my mind, let me just quickly run through what we had! \n\nAmbience: Sakura has always had a very classy feel to it, and the servers were so accomodating and helpful! Really enjoyed the service. \nDrinks: Pina Colada (So smooth and really really good.) Lychee Cooler (Also fantastic. We ordered another mojito but the name eludes me. It was fantastic too!\nSushi: Got an assorted sushi platter, and the California Roll. I am a total sucker for the California Roll, done to perfection. Sushi was also very very good, we were all happy with it. \nPrawn Tempura: What gorgeous prawns! And that batter was so light! \nTeriyaki: Chicken (good, could have done with some more sauce though.) Norwegian Salmon (I missed out on tasting this but was told it was great), Red Snapper. (also very good- definitely order this!)\nTeppenyaki: Prawn (This was good but not our favorite dish). Beef (Perfectly marinated and tender beef that just broke away in your mouth!) \n\nAll in all, it was a really good dinner and the food was well worth the money.

At that moment no body knew about Kabab Rolls they were the one's who introduced and named KABAB ROLL to the people of Karachi... at first people didn't even knew how to open the wrapper of kabab rolls. After their unique taste and popularity they decided to come out of the market and go at a good location so they could promote their unique product to the world. So they rented the place where silver spoon snacks is located now in 1971. As they had a history in restaurants and food they were the 3rd generation in this business. Their Grandfather Late Amjud Ahmed started this business in india in 1910 and made his chains of Amjudia Hotels and Restaurants all over india in his hard worked 20 years and made his company the 1st muslim owned Limited Co. in india as Amjudia Pvt. Ltd. So after partition of the two countries his grand childrens Mojib, Khatib, Habib & Adib followed the tradition and opened the restaurants in karachi. After the big sucess of Silver Spoon Restaurant they needed a bigger place to accommodate and fulfill the needs of their beloved customers so they decided to shift to a bigger place and they shifted on the same road near jheel park and allied bank which was the REAL SILVER SPOON RESTAURANT. And they also opened another popular restaurant by the name of Mojib's Dinner near jheel park. As they shifted the place which is known as silver spoon snacks now was rented by someone else and due to the popularity of the previous business of silver spoon they decided to use the name as it is being used now since then, because in our country u cannot register the name any one can open a silver spoon anywhere in Pakistan without any affiliation. I wold like to ask Mr. Hammad Ur Rehman Awan that please stop misguiding people and by the way mr. awan how could u invent BIHARI KABAB untill or unless you are a behari as they are and they have a history to prove it.

Enough said!\n\nTutti fruti Froyo: I love the fact that they keep bringing in new flavors every week. So far, my favourites have been lychee and peach\nBreakfast at Xanders: Tried their soft scrambled eggs, Xanders Club Sandwich, berry daiquiri and strawberry smoothie?absolutely loved the sandwich! I just wish they had pizza in the mornings too. I can have their pizza at all times of the day!\n\nKolachi:  Had heard alot about their makhani handi?taste was alright but left me feeling too heavy?could not have more than a few bites. I really liked the nachos there! The service there deserves special mention. I would definitely go there again.\n\nA One Rolls: Though I used to love the rolls there as compared to eaton, hot and spicy and other roll places, the past couple of times when I went there, the rolls were soggy and extremely oily. \n\nCup a Soup Chicken Laksa at Aghas: I was very hungry (starving actually lol) when I had it and really liked the lemony coconut soup. Would have preferred if it was just a tiny bit more on the sour side as that is the way I?ve had it in Malaysia. A little more punch can make it really Wow! Btw I tried to make it my way at home the next day (just added a little extra imlee ka pani) and it was fabulous!\n\nButlers for lunch today:  Turkey Club Sandwich was good to taste?however, it was falling apart and not too easy to manage. I did not try the spicy chicken sandwich and Butlers Club Sandwich but my friends seemed satisfied with them. The chocolate decadence and hazelnut dessert (oops forgot the name but the dessert itself was pretty forgettable :S!) were fine. I guess I wasn?t in the mood for sweets. \n\nOh I also attended a dinner event at Marriot. Why oh why does the food at 5star hotels have to be so bland????Loved the potato gratin though..just the right amount of cheese and garlic butter..yum!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-09T19:02:29+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-10T09:54:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"552006156","name":"Shumyla Jawaid"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"753461179","name":"Rohia Zohaib"},{"id":"682241004","name":"Atif Malik"},{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid"},{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"589485566","name":"Murwah Tariq-Atif"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"757449744","name":"Syed Sabih Abbas Razvi"},{"id":"828190023","name":"Shaheen Nouman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODI4MTkwMDIz","before":"NTUyMDA2MTU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"395602850490871","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"\u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T09:54:57+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzk1NjAyODUwNDkwODcx","before":"Mzk1NjAyODUwNDkwODcx"}}},"restaurantName":"Roll"},{"id":"165861103465048_393181204066369","from":{"name":"Sadaf Fahad Khan","id":"724350054"},"message":"One of the reasons Dolmen mall clifton holds my interests is Cinnabon....the smell of freshly baked and warm cinnamon rolls just pulls me towards the outlet....although the big rolls are too heavy for a single person,the mini bons are el perfecto,with just the right amount of evrythng in them...the service is pretty good with friendly staff who are more than ready to greet u with a smile and help u with their fresh products..overall an A+ for all the effort and the outcome...well done :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-05T21:46:28+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-07T17:18:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000921262643","name":"Kanwal Irfan"},{"id":"809891464","name":"Julie Haris"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"570766058","name":"Ayesha Saeed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTcwNzY2MDU4","before":"MTAwMDAwOTIxMjYyNjQz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"393229287394894","from":{"name":"Sairah Khalid","id":"544715226"},"message":"i have yet to visit and try cinnabon, sadaf.\n\nthe other day, a fellow swottie told me she is not fond of it and so do the locals here as they are not used to the concept of eating dough in such large quantities, i presume she meant. then how come our people are pizza maniacs? :oD\n\ndo recommend what you like best. so when i visit, i know what to order :o) thank you.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-05T23:37:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"393295924054897","from":{"name":"Charmaine Hoodbhoy","id":"100003248183175"},"message":"Sadaf!!!

Rolls, Seafood, Ice Cream, Fast Food, BBQ - every restaurant is a jack of all trades. The customer is left confused, and the message as to what's \"good\" is usually distorted.  I have yet to order Golden Dragon or BOTS (not picking on either of you, but just pointing out my indecisiveness) because I have no idea what their best foot forward is. \n\nMy two cents for the day: \nRestaurants should offer less items and focus more on \"quality\" products. At the end of the day- the cost of maintenance, margin for disappointment, and overall efficiency are improved drastically.  If you can't do that, at least have a \"Chef's Recommendation\".  Your client?le will not grow because you suddenly offer a Garlic Mayo Roll, or you started serving Ice Cream.\n\nIf your a Chinese restaurant and your Sweet and Sour Chicken is subpar, please don't offer it for the sake of offering it.  If your a Bakery, and you know burgers are not your forte, please don't risk disappointing the customer.  If you sell Rolls, and for some God forsaken reason you feel like selling me Shakes- at least make sure your product stands out in some perceivable way.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-31T07:26:13+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-31T18:13:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"732705760","name":"Nishat Aleem Khan"},{"id":"544715226","name":"Sairah Khalid"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"511301771","name":"Eefa Khalid"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA4ODc0NDI2NQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NzMyNzA1NzYw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"389549797762843","from":{"name":"Waqas Tariq","id":"1088744265"},"message":"Agreed, happens to me every-time I order from my fav joints.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-31T07:37:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"389550061096150","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"ahsan: i totally understand where ur coming from.

This Noodle Roll they sent over is an interesting concoction...never quite had anything like it but I must say it tastes very good...a sort of egg roll stuffed with noodles and vegetables that makes a good hors d'ouvre. Very generous quantities and good value for money that one equates with comfort food after a long day. The order arrived on time and piping hot all the way to KDA-1. I must mention that a Mr. Ali took my order on the phone and was very efficient and ensured that the chilli levels in the food were low as per my instructions (except of course the beef chilli dry). All in all, a good experience.

Definitely a proper SWOT session with papers and everything. As you have all been reading about the froyo session I thought I'd get my two bits in as well. By the end I was a walking talking froyo machine, a frominator if you will. \n\nBerrylicious:- They have opened a cute little outfit on 26th street. They have now introduced coffee and some other non-froyo items there too, beside froyo, which is interesting but I think they'll have a tough time pulling crowd to their joint. The only incentive for me going there now would be their coconut flavored froyo. Personally I am not very pushed about going to Berrylicious anymore, though it is a little sad as they were the pioneers in introducing froyo to Karachiites. \n\nTutti Frutti:- Definitely the game changer in the froyo market of Karachi. They have completely changed the dynamics of froyo market. Going to TF is always a fun filled experience. At any given point they have 8 flavors with a lot of toppings. The entire experience of making your own froyo is quite novel as well and if you factor in the price, being the cheapest,  TF has quite a bright future ahead of it. They have brought froyo from a niche market to the masses. I'd be frequenting them quite often. Lychee, TF tart, pomegranate and blueberry are excellent flavors and must be tried.  \n\nSNOG:- Haute Couture froyo. If one were to categorize froyos into automobiles, SNOG would be the Rolls Royce of froyos. It is certainly the most expensive of the lot and every penny is worth it. They are targeting to the consumer with with a complex taste palate, one who does wants to taste the most natural and creamiest froyo. It may not appeal to the masses but then again SNOG at the end of the day, is all about quality and not quality. The toppings available are quite exotic as well. None of the other places can match the luxury toppings offered at SNOG. Natural and passion fruit flavors are sure shot winners. \n\nThe Upper Crust:- Personally I have never been a huge fan of froyo at TUC. One primary reason being the limitations of froyo flavors and toppings at TUC. Having said that no other froyo place can match the Belgian chocolate froyo at TUC, one simply cannot tell if they are having froyo or gelato. Add a few fresh, sliced strawberries and you'd be all set. One other flavor that deserves a special mention is mango. It was sort of a limited edition and again, it was simply superb. Too bad it is off the menu now as I have always missed it, let us hope it is introduced once again. But TUC is not just a froyo joint, it has other plenty of amazing offerings on the menu. Pi?ce de r?sistance being the baked goods, the coffees, the foods and ofcourse if one wants froyo, that too, is on the menu.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-17T08:14:43+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-17T18:37:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"501447368","name":"Lubna Ashraf Jafri"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"509700022","name":"Hiba Akmal"},{"id":"100002308246996","name":"Sana Shah"},{"id":"501891633","name":"Komal Tauqeer"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk0MjM4NzQy","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"380846481966508","from":{"name":"Shafia Agha","id":"650845003"},"message":"excellent review!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T08:16:30+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"380846921966464","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Faisal Naseer, quite possibly the best and most honest review I have ever read...... that is the spirit of truth.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T08:18:25+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"380848571966299","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Faisal Naseer, i think majority of us who were on a FroYo spree last eve have reached the same conclusion.  very well written.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T08:25:16+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"380853551965801","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"Woah, what has fro yo done to u guys, aik kay bad aik honest and objective review, now i am not having one, is main kuch hai, very well written Faisal Naseer","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T08:42:18+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer","type":"user","offset":144,"length":13}]},{"id":"380853728632450","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Faisal Naseer very well put HAUTE COUTURE - SNOG is surely for the discerning few and totally the niche market. thu not a great business formula - a place where one is not going to run into everyone from everywhere","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T08:43:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"380857348632088","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"loll Najam Quddusi!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-17T08:54:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi","type":"user","offset":5,"length":13}]},{"id":"380861431965013","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"Zehra A.

Thanks also for taking the time out to grade and rate the world new trend which is frozen yogurt - delicious and non-offensive to health. I find all the comments and opinions honest, candid, very well researched and detailed. Criticism is taken on board, as always, along with positive feedback. The positive stuff makes all the hard work over the past few months very worthwhile. I'm not too active on all the food groups for various reasons but I try and look out for all sorts of comments from which I base myself on for areas of improvements. Being in this industry, one should be on their toes for constant development and customer satisfaction. I hope to be seeing you all again and serving you with a guilt-free treat.
