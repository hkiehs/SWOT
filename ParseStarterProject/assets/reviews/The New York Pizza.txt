The pizza was simply HEAVENLY! It was just amazing! They have earned the title of best pizza in the entire city in my opinion, there's just not enough praise for it!\n\nThe garlic bread however, was very disappointing.. it was just soooooooo small! the taste was fine, but the size was making me cry! There's nothing to say about the drink obviously, it was just an average coke. (tbh I prefer Pepsi though)\n\nAll in all, Garlic bread was a 3/10, while the pizza, oh god, it was an 11!
