The difference tonight was Irfan Malik's presence, who thanks to his love for Turkish food, designed the spectacular menu! And my God, he's a genius! The star of the evening was Kar???k Pide clubbed with Doner.. in easier terms, it was Turkish Pizza overloaded with a very generous serving of juicy Doner beef. This merger of two separate items was an off-the-menu brainchild of my husband and wow, I was blown away! The pizza even without the extra meat was scrumptious and crispy! The slivers of doner beef were tender, juicy with just enough flavour. \nThe rest of the meal included Ezogelin Soup (lentil soup), Durum Doner (doner wrap), and Soslu Tavuk (which is quite like Chicken Shashlik). The soup was a bit bland but the sauces helped. Durum Doner has become a personal favourite of mine. Soslu Tavuk was fantastic, although it may be considered as an acquired taste since I'm quite sure some lamb fat goes into it to give it that authentic flavour. \nAll in all, a very scrumptious and fulfilling meal it was, and my love for SOLEN has increased manifold!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-28T20:45:28+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-30T02:57:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"100000510679894","name":"Kanwal Hafeez"},{"id":"780381887","name":"Samar Husain"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"704566421","name":"Zubair Uddin"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"707220178","name":"Zohra Rajpar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzA3MjIwMTc4","before":"NTAxNDE1NzE2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"529520373765784","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Irfan Malik I know who to take when Shaikh Fawad convinces me to go to DMC for the Turkish meal.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-29T05:42:36+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"632567679","name":"Irfan Malik","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad","type":"user","offset":36,"length":12}]},{"id":"529520460432442","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Saira Malik the pics look yum and incredibly tempting","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-29T05:43:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"529544690430019","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"Pide with donner... we used to do that too...

I have no intention of narrating a thesis or review laced with superlatives. For starters we had Hummus with garlic nan and Mulligatawny soup, the hummus was well flavored n blended, but the soup was too thick and need to be accurate this will like broth.Main course comprised of Shisk Touk,Afghani Kebab (chicken) Chicken Shashlik and Chicken Ginger. Shish Taouk was superb, very tender and succulent, Afghani Kebab was comparibly harder but great taste, Chicken Ginger is another fantastic dish, spicy but well flavored with lemon, always drain the excess oil and dice it with lemon, Whole wheat and Kandhari nans to accompany these were great. Only point which I noticed was staff has been changed and old faces are conspicious by their absence, new servers are a bit raw and it will take them time to get polished and reach the level of their successors. Last but not the least Berrylicious frozen yogurt in natural and chocolate flavor was heavenly and quite reasonable at 130 rupees. In the east bbq tonite is still the best.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-04-29T20:45:01+0000","updated_time":"2012-04-29T20:45:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ3Mjg1NTcz","before":"ODQ3Mjg1NTcz"}}},"restaurantName":"Shashlik"},{"id":"165861103465048_301504973233993","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Dinner: after Hanifia Fish n Chips, Quetta Alamgir Hotel Omelette Paratha take-away dinner from Daily Dubai: Chicken Malai Boti / Irani Boti / Chicken Shashlik / Mutton Masala / Mutton Qeema Hari Mirch / Daal / Steamed Rice / Naan","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-22T20:23:14+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-23T06:10:40+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"692291130","name":"Samir S.

The pepper steak well done was just right,juicy and tender with lot of charred onions, couldn't have asked for anything else, sorry Arizona Grill nothing like a steak served sizzling on the hot plate for 550 a piece instead of your cold and drab steak, which is not worth the price.Last but not the least Kulfi was well made and served hard with savienya.
