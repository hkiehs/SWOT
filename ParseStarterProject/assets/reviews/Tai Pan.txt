We happen to go to China kitchen some time back for which I had made a reservation in advance. When we go there, I was told that we could not be accommodated inside where we were initially booked for and the only option was to sit out side. It was not a matter of sitting outside but the way the hostess put it was, take it or leave it. There was someone already sitting on then table apparently waiting for their table inside. Our guests started to arrive so we decided to just take the table. The setup was actually thrown on the table, without actually being. The way they  took the order was if we had done a favor coming to the restaurant. The food was very average - Dynasty @ Avari is still the best and there is no comparison. Anyway the dinner ended and as I drove off, I realized the I realized the left hand mirror on the door had been ripped and stolen. I called the restaurant back when I reached home I was spoke to the hostess who said to send her the bill for the repairs.  After having the mirror repaired thru the insurance i took the bill for balance payments as insurance companies deduct for depreciation. At the restaurant the hostess simply refused to accommodate as she says it was on the slip when I had the car valet parked that it was on my own risk. Her attitude was again rude and arrogant. Something which I should I have expected as she showed it the day we went there for dinner. I just took the bill back and walked out. While I do understand that cars are parked at owners risk, there is still a duty of care the owners are supposed to provide. She did mention that they have tried to remove the druggies from around the neighborhood who could have possibly stolen, but it was not there fault. Since then I have decided not to go there. I thought of posting this earlier but decided against it. The new restaurants, and the look restaurants must remember the first thing about hospitality it's customer service.  Even if you want to say no, they must learn to say it politely  .","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-20T15:46:50+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-21T12:12:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"780833634","name":"Erum Ahmed"},{"id":"654298693","name":"Huma Akhter Mundia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjU0Mjk4Njkz","before":"NzgwODMzNjM0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"382920588425764","from":{"name":"Zehra Khan","id":"503738833"},"message":"And this is why I won't be goin bak to CK for a long long time.....and if I did...it prob be a favor to them.
