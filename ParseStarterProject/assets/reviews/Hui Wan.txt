'Hui Wan' totally won us over with its ambiance and excellent service. \nWe ordered prawn and corriander soup upon their recommendation (10/10), chicken schezwan \n(9/10), prawn sizzler (9/10), and egg fried rice (9/10). \nA full ten on ten for the wonderful service. Very courteous and helpful staff and a lovely ambiance with just the right amount of lighting. Comfortable seating which was quite appropriatly spaced. We dined in their covered section due to the weather and loved it. They had covered the sides with clear plastic which didn't ruin the view a bit. \nWill definitely be going back to this place.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-30T02:18:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-31T01:16:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"838335067","name":"Farah Mirza"},{"id":"100005302207877","name":"Hira ShAh"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"601065485","name":"Indus Farhan"},{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"524501080","name":"Zohaib Ali Memon"},{"id":"635810442","name":"Kiran Afzal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjM1ODEwNDQy","before":"ODM4MzM1MDY3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"675001175884369","from":{"name":"Sina Ali Saim","id":"719895844"},"message":"Acha bachoo hamaray sath 2darya jatay huay thund lagtee hai :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-31T01:07:48+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"675003519217468","from":{"name":"Tooba Asim","id":"856955690"},"message":"Kids were left at home.

Prompt on time serving, extremely courteous waiters and to my surprise they were trained in english. The service made my day.  \n\nOk secondly a big WOW to the person who created the ambiance of that place. It looked and felt spectacular.\nAll red and really cozy. The upper decks had an even better feel.\nI award it the best looking restaurant at do darya *if there is such an award*\n\nI bounced around on all three decks and 3 different spots after finally deciding to settle down on the very first one :p. *salutes their level of patience*\n\nOk now food..\nOrdered chicken corn soup for starters, chicken fried rice, chicken manchurian and chicken chilli noodles.\n\nSoups:\nThick creamy with lots of corn that is exactly how i like my soup and that is exactly what i got.  So thumbs up.\n\nChicken Manchurian:\nI am the self proclaimed queen of manchurian lol and after searching through half the city i have finally found my manchurian spot !! It tasted spot on. Had the perfect hit of tanginess and the sweet and sour ka combo. One spoonful and i was dancing with the fishes. *moment of pure joyy*\n\nChicken Chilli Noodles:\nI just had a taste of them since im not a noodle person but my friend who is a freak o noodle enjoyed them enough to chow down the whole bowl. *they gotta be good*\n\nFried Rice:\n10/10 \n\nOverall:\nWith the total being around 2k with drinks i give it a yes for value for money.\nLoved the food and i learned its only their soft launch ka phase. Thumbs up to the service i very rarely get impressed by service.\nTaste 10/10\nAmbiance 11/10\nService 11/10","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-25T21:36:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-28T08:05:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"651643760","name":"Jasrah Mubarak"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100003048580286","name":"Nayyera Saeed"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"100003324650990","name":"Imran Chef"},{"id":"100006791794583","name":"Shaiful M Wala"},{"id":"655635427","name":"Joanna Cash"},{"id":"100001052705593","name":"Shan Baloch"},{"id":"100001577208784","name":"Shahzad Shahab"},{"id":"100000556308750","name":"Laraib Malik"},{"id":"1057693917","name":"Hira Abbasi"},{"id":"100001404799008","name":"Muhammad Hussain Khan"},{"id":"581135723","name":"Faizan Rasheed"},{"id":"1304434596","name":"Syeda Jabeen Jahanzeb"},{"id":"829254501","name":"Kamran Anwer"},{"id":"100003436701094","name":"Rayan Raza"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"796000540","name":"Nisa Abdul Basit Khan"},{"id":"867800502","name":"Hira Saiyed"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"100003156069393","name":"Shajia Sajjad"},{"id":"100003570224157","name":"Kashif Khan"},{"id":"100003361185490","name":"Iram Faisal"},{"id":"613251390","name":"Asma A.

Then came the tasteless wings dunt even think abt orderin it.. Then chicken manchurian and beef chilli dry both well done spicy well cooked n delicious.. Then came the noodles with vegis and american chop sui both wer just ok ok in term of taste both had its own desi taste u cant compare with china town or ginsoy..

The rice and noodles were both well seasoned and cooked well. In fact many commented how nice the rice was on its own. Chicken Schezuan was amazing as was the beef chili dry, and honey chicken with sesame (a little too sweet for my taste) the sticky sweet fish I don't like anywhere and this was no exception thu really liked the lemon fish. \n\nAll in all a good evening spent with great friends checking out a new place. We wish them all the best and hope that the few issues they were facing will be sorted out before the hungry crowds of discerning Karachiites arrive.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-19T06:01:40+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-20T18:17:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"724148371","name":"Rabia Hai"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"514292991","name":"Marium Hosein"},{"id":"547501074","name":"Rehana Naseer"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"522977702","name":"Sheikh Hasan Rasul"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"504517271","name":"Usman Tanzeel"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"622525326","name":"Mohsin E Azam"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"511301771","name":"Eefa Khalid"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI0NDc2NzM1","before":"NTg0NjgyMjQz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_620982761286211/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTI0NDc2NzM1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"620983104619510","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"The place does have a name but its not yet put up outside.
