Last week was my birthday and I had planned on taking some friends out for a nice sit down dinner. The dinner was set for Friday and I called Fuschia on Tuesday to book their private room for 13 people. On Thursday I went to Fuschia and set the menu and increased the booking to 14 people, I was informed I will be able to accommodate 14 people in the private room. At 11:30 in the night I received a call from Fuschia informing me that they have no record of my booking for the private room and that I had just booked a table in the smoking section, they also informed me that the private room was already booked and the party had already paid a deposit.After arguing for a while the lady on the phone admitted she made a mistake with my booking, I understand human error is unavoidable but to realize this and inform me at 11:30pm the night before is unacceptable. I was extremely disappointed as I was looking forward to enjoying my night in privacy. In protest I cancelled my booking and was basically left without a venue 1 night before my dinner  :( and I knew finding a place for 14 on a Friday night would not be an easy task. A friend recommended Thyme, I called them up Friday afternoon and they graciously informed me they would make all the necessary arrangements for me on such short notice. Thyme did a lovely job, we took over almost the entire upper floor, I set a standardized menu (Chicken satay and Greek salad for starters and as mains an option of chicken in tarragon sauce, roast beef with risotto, prawn in thyme sauce or red snapper on a bed of crab meat) and they wrote out the options on their board for my guests. Dim lights, candles and soft music created the perfect atmosphere. The service was efficient, polite and it was an overall heart warming experience.... I highly recommend Thyme and really don't understand why it's not as popular as other similar restaurants.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T17:30:27+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-09T04:06:58+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"797300590","name":"Aman Virji"},{"id":"593086875","name":"Pervin Minwalla"},{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"668675270","name":"Maliha Ejaz"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"500616229","name":"Sama Aman"},{"id":"1768497575","name":"Ally Aadil Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTc2ODQ5NzU3NQ\u003d\u003d","before":"Nzk3MzAwNTkw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"374029089314914","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Wow.

Then we wantedmain courses while our friendsjust wanted beverages and dessert - and the manager says, u can't only have dessert. You have to order dinner too. Can u believe this utter crap? The customer is not allowed to decide if he/she just want dessert. We tried to reason with them, that two people WERE ordering main courses, so why couldn't the others have dessert, but he refused.
