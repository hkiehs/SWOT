I was very pleased with the sushi experience. This is not my first encounter with sushi but definitely my first time in Karachi. Since I was a newbie, my friend basically ordered everything and I just went with the flow. We ordered the steamed prawn dumplings, the beef dish called Negimiyaki and the main platter which was the Moriwase. Firstly, we started off with the Nama Yasai, which is the fresh vegetable salad drizzled with their special Fujiyama sauce. It was a nice light salad and the sauce was delicious. Secondly, we moved on to the steamed dumplings, my first bite into it, I was in love! The sauce and the flavor of the dumplings, just hit the right spot. My taste buds were definitely having a party! Next was the the Negimiyaki, oh my! I thoroughly enjoyed the beef styled sushi stuffed with spring onions. They were a tough one to chew through as a whole but the beef was very flavorful served with excellent teriyaki sauce. Next came the Moriwase platter which was an assortment of sushi (salmon, tuna, crab, prawn). I was skeptical when I first saw the platter thinking whether I would be able to digest this beautifully crafted food of art. I didn't waste any time and dived into it, it was quite an adrenaline rush! I enjoyed eating every piece and had them dripping with sauce. I added a dash of wasabi to the soy sauce and it still gave a strong bite to it. Every piece was well balanced with perfectly cooked rice served at the right temperature. The fish itself was bursting with flavor, with the balance favoring more fish than rice. The weather was lovely today, and I enjoyed the view from the rooftop which made the whole experience even more enjoyable. I ended the experience with green tea and it felt just right. I am so impressed that Karachi has such an excellent Japanese restaurant.  Service was prompt and friendly.

I was very pleased with the sushi experience. This is not my first encounter with sushi but definitely my first time in Karachi. Since I was a newbie, my friend basically ordered everything and I just went with the flow. We ordered the steamed prawn dumplings, the beef dish called Negimiyaki and the main platter which was the Moriwase. Firstly, we started off with the Nama Yasai, which is the fresh vegetable salad drizzled with their special Fujiyama sauce. It was a nice light salad and the sauce was delicious. Secondly, we moved on to the steamed dumplings, my first bite into it, I was in love! The sauce and the flavor of the dumplings, just hit the right spot. My taste buds were definitely having a party! Next was the the Negimiyaki, oh my! I thoroughly enjoyed the beef styled sushi stuffed with spring onions. They were a tough one to chew through as a whole but the beef was very flavorful served with excellent teriyaki sauce. Next came the Moriwase platter which was an assortment of sushi (salmon, tuna, crab, prawn). I was skeptical when I first saw the platter thinking whether I would be able to digest this beautifully crafted food of art. I didn't waste any time and dived into it, it was quite an adrenaline rush! I enjoyed eating every piece and had them dripping with sauce. I added a dash of wasabi to the soy sauce and it still gave a strong bite to it. Every piece was well balanced with perfectly cooked rice served at the right temperature. The fish itself was bursting with flavor, with the balance favoring more fish than rice. The weather was lovely today, and I enjoyed the view from the rooftop which made the whole experience even more enjoyable. I ended the experience with green tea and it felt just right. I am so impressed that Karachi has such an excellent Japanese restaurant.  Service was prompt and friendly.  I will definitely be coming here again and again!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-02T20:12:10+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-03T07:34:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"732665092","name":"Mariam Bandukda"},{"id":"576301855","name":"Kashif Dadwani"},{"id":"502191902","name":"Zaigham Hidayatullah"},{"id":"603103229","name":"Danish Munir"},{"id":"521420389","name":"Syed Jami Amin"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"854755191","name":"Suhana Sami"},{"id":"693205243","name":"Madiha Saeed Patel"},{"id":"785615314","name":"Maleeha Jawaid"},{"id":"731377379","name":"Shahzad Pirwani"},{"id":"539982540","name":"Arfa Abid"},{"id":"500616229","name":"Sama Aman"},{"id":"657151302","name":"Nishat Mustafa"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"1241494164","name":"Dania Obaid-Naseem"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"527881636","name":"Marina Khan"},{"id":"509568517","name":"Beenish Ehsan"},{"id":"514292991","name":"Marium Hosein"},{"id":"692390995","name":"Wahaj M Khan"},{"id":"1257283317","name":"Aymun Zafar"},{"id":"512612823","name":"Leena Faruqui"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzQ5MTE0NTE0","before":"MTU0MjY2OTM5Mg\u003d\u003d"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_579638998753921/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTAwMDAwNzQ5MTE0NTE0"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"579639108753910","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"fuji is my all time fav japanese place. :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-02T20:12:44+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579639345420553","from":{"name":"Zeeshan Rasool","id":"100000095643451"},"message":"gonna c/p this so I can remember the name of the dishes when I go next :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-02T20:13:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579642592086895","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Zeeshan...next time you go there ask for Badar...he's very helpful and will recommend you what you like... :-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-02T20:22:38+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579642762086878","from":{"name":"Zeeshan Rasool","id":"100000095643451"},"message":"Will do :) thanks for the tip","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-02T20:23:14+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579643355420152","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":":-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-02T20:25:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"579656395418848","from":{"name":"Hanya Javaid","id":"1090005239"},"message":"i didnt like the taste of fuji yama's food...

Was advised on the phone to make it 8:30 to which I showed my inability so they very kindly acceded to my request to accommodate us at 9:00 for which I am extremely grateful to the management of CK.  reached at 8:50 pm to find the restaurant empty but soon other customers started to arrive and by the time we left at around 10:00 the place was still half empty (CK management, why was I asked to make my reservation 8:30 instead of 9:00 when the restaurant was not booked to full capacity?) the servers were very courteous and the food didn't take much time to arrive at the table - 10/10 for service. Starters - Hot & Sour Soup - was liked by all 4 of us but it was a bit too sour, would taste even better if the vinegar is put on hold, Wasabi Prawns - 4 decent sized prawns fried and coated in wasabi/creamy white sauce served luke warm and Crab Rangoon - creamy crab meat wontons served cold - 6/10 for starters.  Main courses, Mu Shu Chicken - DIY paper thin pancakes served separately with chicken qeema and a black sauce - very desi stuff, Kung Pao Chicken - chunks of boneless chicken in red sauce with veggies and cashew nuts which were liked by all, Beef Steak - chunks of beef with veggies in black sauce, again liked by all, egg fried rice and chicken chowmein (very salty with excessive use of soy sauce with hardly any chicken meat in it) - 7/10 for main courses.  Prices reduced since my earlier visit and quantities much improved, the above order would suffice 5 persons easily. Total damage approx 5K inclusive of soft drinks and 16% GST.
