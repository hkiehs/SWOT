But being a sunday night, and having crazy rush everywhere else, we didn't have much of an option for desi food.\nSo anyway, as soon as we got seated, the waiters were very polite and courteous. Took our order quickly, were prompt with suggestions, served quickly and were generally impressive.\nFirst came the complimentary Gol Guppay and Dahi Puri - both of which were 9/10!! the paani in gol gappay was better than any other i've tasted and the puris in both were crisp and tasty.\nThen the food - we ordered dum ka keema, malai boti, dhaaga kebab, mutton karhai and fish tikka. (with roghni & garlic naan plus sheermal)\nEverything tasted AMAZING except for the fisk tikka. That was the only thing we didn't enjoy.\nThen we ordered dessert (shahi tukray and gulab jamun), both of which were not good.\nOverall speaking - a VERY good experience with food and service. 8/10 with only issues being that dessert was not good at all and fish tikka was stale. (Plus a little on the pricey side ~ 900/person.)\nVery happy with the experience :D","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-16T16:06:12+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-17T08:09:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000051806482","name":"Saquib Currim"},{"id":"581870213","name":"Saad Noma"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100001772445260","name":"Zamzam Shah"},{"id":"100003079123808","name":"Waseem Izzat"},{"id":"100002252913885","name":"Haseeb Sami"},{"id":"705430280","name":"Haris Mahmood"},{"id":"1257237310","name":"Taha Usman"},{"id":"1195811332","name":"Ahmed Shahab"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"758853691","name":"Shah M Alam"},{"id":"728987421","name":"Rayyan Sohail"},{"id":"100000446704703","name":"Almas Mehmood"},{"id":"100007310070601","name":"Urban KaveGirl"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"100000764441277","name":"Shahyaan Abd"},{"id":"597000855","name":"Anita N Anil"},{"id":"1360287056","name":"Afshan Riaz Bhayani"},{"id":"756768261","name":"Muhammad Aslam"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"100002364449168","name":"Mansoor Hussain"},{"id":"745130093","name":"HG Bachani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ1MTMwMDkz","before":"MTAwMDAwMDUxODA2NDgy"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_667621676622319/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzQ1MTMwMDkz"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"667630359954784","from":{"name":"Muhammad Aslam","id":"756768261"},"message":"I have been going there ever since they had opened .

In case you're wondering, I did not just go to a restaurant in Karachi. So I can't really share my experience at one of these that are discussed here.\n\nBut what i will tell you is that I have lived in Karachi for most of my life (well, until I decided to go study engineering at NUST Islamabad). Even more than the lights and the life Karachi resonates with, what I miss the most is food... OUR Food. From the \"ami kay hath ki pakai hwe bhujya\" and Bun Kabab Stalls at Tariq Road to Kolachi at the rocks, every bite has had a special taste to it- one that is simply absent from the food that I eat here.\n\nPlease don't misunderstand me. Islamabad has some amazing restaurants. Chai khaana and Kitchen Cuisine, for instance, are worth a try. But the taste, the mix, the presentation and everything else is something we Karachiites can never settle for.\n\nEveryday, I stare down at food that lacks in spices, add-on veggies, and often in cooking too. After all, the hostel dining hall has to cater to students from all over the country. From what I have inferred, the spice intake generally decreases as you go \"up\" the country.\n\n The Haleem on Saturdays is nowhere near to the one you guys can eat at Burns Road. You would not believe that what I get on Thursdays is Biryani if you've have had a plate at any of the dhabbas or even your own place. The Qorma here? Oh boy if only they would use Shaan Masalas for that.\n\nYou know, I have kind of given up on the restaurants here too (seriously, how can anyone manage to eat  Afghani Burger?) What I now look most forward to is the monthly courier parcel my mom sends me. Yesterday I opened December to find packets of shami kababs, home made spaghetti, and chicken wings ^__^\n\nKarachi is under fire. Karachi is at War. Karachi probably needs a batman . But trust me, you guys still get damn good food to eat. I lost like 6 kg in my first 3 months here. Still haven't managed to recover all of that.\n\nBe grateful for the food you eat;love Karachi for it.\n\nStay safe \u003c3","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-09T20:55:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-10T19:26:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"807153988","name":"Huma Hussan"},{"id":"698480213","name":"Faiza Shafiq"},{"id":"100002459812246","name":"Mumtaz Begum Tejani"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"537798684","name":"Abdul Basit Memon"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"567975179","name":"Saadia Tariq"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"697750147","name":"Mohammad Ismail Asif"},{"id":"672626621","name":"Asad Baig"},{"id":"753624574","name":"Shazmeen Raza"},{"id":"100001993284398","name":"Rumaisa Nasir"},{"id":"650649934","name":"Ashnaa F Khan"},{"id":"564445611","name":"Shahbaz Ali Shueb"},{"id":"100002861468579","name":"Javeria Talal"},{"id":"100006019808344","name":"Anum Ellahi"},{"id":"552958742","name":"Amir Arfeen"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"100001408655261","name":"Faizan Kamran"},{"id":"864385150","name":"Faiz Khalil Shaikh"},{"id":"513198695","name":"Madiha Shiekh"},{"id":"655137222","name":"Hufsa Rizwan"},{"id":"781150340","name":"Huma Baqir"},{"id":"100006538473120","name":"Ali Shujaat"},{"id":"649725153","name":"Ateeb Akber"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ5NzI1MTUz","before":"ODA3MTUzOTg4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_664275373623616/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjQ5NzI1MTUz"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"664372816947205","from":{"name":"Faiz Rahila","id":"681048718"},"message":"Very well said Hassan.

First on the list was Fish hot and sour soup (white) which was the appetizer followed by the Dhaka finger fish the all time favorite, Jumbo prawn tempura and then the legendary Leather Jacket fillet in green masala, Fish Behari boti a new entrant as i had not tried it before, Pangush Boti Karahi,Chicken Fried Rice, Kids meal Crispy Chicken Burger Zinger,Garlic Nan, cold drinks and mineral water.\n\nOK, now for the mixed reviews i had been reading about Bots, well yes its has changed, it has evolved for the better and now is a proper food street fine dining dhaba style restaurant :)\nLimca stall was their earlier, now their a doc juice shop, i don't know the name of the doc but its good,dai bara stall and a pan stall plus loud music playing so the ambiance was definitely lively and more festive.\n\nNow coming to the revision in prices, yes their has been an slight increase in cost due to 16% GST but they are GST registered and the GST/SNTN is S3966140-7 and my bill had an addition of Rs.500, but rest assured it is being deposited in the national exchequer 100% which is cumulatively a substantial amount.\n\nThe real increase in prices is not that much considering they are delivering on quality and quantity, the fish was fresh, juicy, well marinated and had great flavor, as good as in the past if not better. The chatnis and the lemon add to the flavor too.\nThe service was quick and the food was served piping hot. Only one dish that was the Pangush Boti Karahi lacked flavor and was quite bland, i think that needs to be worked on and can improve with some minor adjustments.\n\nLadies and gentlemen Bots is known as the best seafood Dhabba in Karachi and upgraded its position now to a \"food street fine dining dhaba style restaurant\"\nnot a bad deal considering that a similar meal at a fine dining seafood joint would cost you 60% more with the frills and fancies, but as far as I am concerned the core issue is the product, and as long as I get value for money in terms of quality and quantity I am a happy camper indeed and plan to return to Bots soon for another round of scrumptious sea food delicacies.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-03T22:13:06+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-05T06:30:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"100000674735601","name":"Muhammad Patel"},{"id":"1004056348","name":"Zaryab Shaikh"},{"id":"100001433820134","name":"Hasan Raza"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"1413795365","name":"Hiba Jamali"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"521735682","name":"Aamir Shahnawaz"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"593601228","name":"Muhammad Saifullah"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100000446704703","name":"Almas Mehmood"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"564100900","name":"Fawad Hai"},{"id":"645099594","name":"Mujahid Iqbal"},{"id":"100002698452985","name":"Rabia Mahmood"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjk4NDUyOTg1","before":"MTE5ODgzMTM3Ng\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"644634672254353","from":{"name":"Mahad Mustafa","id":"805150435"},"message":"Syed Zulfiqar Ali Kazmi!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-03T22:58:39+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"585210551","name":"Syed Zulfiqar Ali Kazmi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":23}]},{"id":"644851935565960","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Oh I see it now.

Usually avoid going to the fancy restaurants offering desi cuisine because let's face it, we all love the roadside food regardless of its hygienic value. Anyhow, this place has really come out as a surprise ! Our order included the following:\n- Nihari\n- Biryani\n- Haleem\nThe Nihari is an absolute treat for the taste buds considering I personally am not a huge fam of Nihari. Desi makes its Nihari in Yakhni and it is the sort that you don't barf all day after having some. The quantity was good enough for 5 of us. It's slightly less thicker than we usually have everywhere else. The one DESI offers is light and tastes exceptionally good as compared to other Nihari walas around. Highly recommended !\n\nDesi's Biryani is something that I have not skipped in the last two visits to this place. Those who have tried it know it very well so won't go into the details. Great quantity and taste. Easily the best offered among other competing restaurants.\n\nThe Haleem *sigh*. I thought I'd never have Haleem anytime during the year except the Moharram season, but this was exquisite. Great taste with and without the condiments that come with it.\n\nA great addition to the \"desi\" eatery scene in Karachi and people who want to spare the khuaari of going to places like Burns Road and the likes, should definitely give this place a try !","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-16T13:29:12+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T12:01:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"520882045","name":"Ghulam Ali"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"100004118826944","name":"Talha Shahid"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"1060866489","name":"Saher Fatima"},{"id":"100003388785108","name":"Almas Altaf"},{"id":"1093133476","name":"Aly Ramzan"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"529620428","name":"Roomana Nasir"},{"id":"1109359970","name":"Altaf Suleman"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"825020244","name":"Bilal Ahmed Khawaja"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"100001121891691","name":"Maliha Aziz"},{"id":"1322402405","name":"Saqib Raza"},{"id":"1188460281","name":"Hira Mohammad"},{"id":"100003937801603","name":"Asma Malik"},{"id":"1533645688","name":"Zia Rehman"},{"id":"100000764441277","name":"Shahyaan Abd"},{"id":"581870213","name":"Saad Noma"},{"id":"524740437","name":"Ahsan Khawaja"},{"id":"100001822097920","name":"Sara Kazmi"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM4MjM2MTI1Ng\u003d\u003d","before":"NTIwODgyMDQ1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619612791423208","from":{"name":"Faiza Siddiq Ahmed","id":"570411310"},"message":"How much did it cost per head","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T13:36:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619613861423101","from":{"name":"Aly Abbas","id":"636734568"},"message":"A mere 300 per head","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T13:40:13+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619622014755619","from":{"name":"Abbas Lacewala","id":"1484122906"},"message":"wheres it located?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T14:06:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619622511422236","from":{"name":"Aly Abbas","id":"636734568"},"message":"Main Shahbaz, same lane as Gon Pacci","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T14:07:31+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619622761422211","from":{"name":"Rashid Sultan","id":"1013627848"},"message":"Whats the address or any FB page of Desi @Aly Abbas","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T14:08:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619623024755518","from":{"name":"Saad Noma","id":"581870213"},"message":"well man nahari was class of its own the perfect nahari which i wanted to have hats off DESI","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T14:09:00+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619623608088793","from":{"name":"Aly Abbas","id":"636734568"},"message":"Rashid Sultan Here you go\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pkDesiCuisine","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T14:11:03+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"1013627848","name":"Rashid Sultan","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"619625098088644","from":{"name":"Rashid Sultan","id":"1013627848"},"message":"Thanks.... will give a try for dinner soon !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T14:15:38+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619641598086994","from":{"name":"Saad Noma","id":"581870213"},"message":"rashid do try nahari","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T14:51:12+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619641981420289","from":{"name":"Saqib Raza","id":"1322402405"},"message":"I loved the Haleem.

Ended up at Peking (this AWKWARD Chinese place at Bahadurabad) and I have been forced to share my review since i spent ...oh sorry wasted 1600 bucks. P.S the following pictures and reviews are about to notify serious competition to Golden Dragon, Red Emperor, Ginsoy and Chairman Mao....\nThe burger qaum (DHA/Clifton residents) is set to dine in at pricey places! Well long live all u eateries.....u guys charge for hygiene, standard and items mentioned on your menus!\n\nSo me and Shahroz Ali visited PEKING....the place was really really really shady but fully crowded with families since it was a sunday night. To my utter disappointed, the moment i opened the menu, my jaw dropped wide open! Nothing for less than Rs.500. Since i found it way to awkward (thinking i wud have rather bin to Red Emperor or Ginsoy for Chinese Dine in) i thought i'd place my order. We ordered 1 Chicken Fried Rice, 1 Lemon Chicken and 1 Hot n Sour Soup. The waiter told the servings were for 2 and my heart sank further. (so i was about to have 250 k sabzi chawal. 250 ka laal paani and nimboo murgi for 250! My hard earned Quaid e Azam :'( ) The order arrived within  15 mins while I kept observing the place. The trays they used were the steel ones used at burns road k tikkay wale....Neways this is what I got\n\nHot N Sour Soup. Simply liquid Ketchup, loaded with Hara Dhania (coriander) for God knows what reason\nLemon Chicken : Boiled chicken, cornflour in the stock as the gravy and literally half a litre lemon juice along with more lemon slices compared to the chicken\nChicken fried rice: Tasteless, completely raw veges\n\nHad a few bites and eventually got it all packed, since it got really late...ended up at Indus for Biryani! The portions were actually scanty and...v tried this place just for the heck of it.....Never Again\nFor all those who thought i can never criticize a place, here it it. I never post reviews about my bad experiences since if i just like to let go off being mean, but this place got my pukes stuck within my throat only!

Laziest and the most unprofessional service one can imagine!\n\nCalled to ask if order (Biryani Centre) can be placed via phone. The operator said that due to a large number of orders, it is not possible to take orders via phone. Please order through the website or app.\n\nNext thing - order placed on the website within 5 minutes, at 6.12pm. Called myself just to confirm if they had received it and expected delivery time etc. Four attempts, call drops each time it gets to the operator. \n\nAnnoyed. Called Indus Foods directly and placed the order. Called foodpanda again to cancel the order. Three more attempts but still can't get through. Indus Foods order arrives within 30 mins. All is well with the countdown to iftar until...\n\n7.09pm - SMS, email and call - all received simultaneously from foodpanda! The operator started with 'I'd like to confirm your order. Your order will be delivered within 50 minutes'. When I told him to cancel the order due to super late response, the operator dares to go ahead with his FIRST LIE: 'Due to the long order queue, confirmation calls are SLIGHTLY late'. Hmm... 60 minutes late - are they that understaffed? Nah! They must be getting a zillion orders by the minute. Good for the pandas.\n\nAsked him to cancel the order but he wouldn't budge. Told him 60 mins of no response (plus 50 mins delivery time starting from this minute) is not acceptable. Even if I confirm now, it'll take the order minimum 15 mins to get here, wont it? Then the operator dares to lie for the second time: \"Your order was being processed. It will be there any moment. Let me coordinate with Biryani Centre, the rider might just be outside your gate even.\"\nSo now orders are being delivered without any confirmation? Interesting.\n\nWhen I questioned him on how he had initially called to confirm and then said the rider might be at my gate (in which case calling was futile anyway), the operator continued to digress or argue. Told him he's welcome to 'confirm and forward' the order to Biryani Centre but, if and when it arrives, it won't be collected or paid for since he's flatly refusing to cancel the order.\n\nWhile I'd like to believe the refusal thing worked in getting the order cancelled, I hope a Biryani Centre rider does not show up at my gate any time now. After all, its been only 2 hours since they called. One never knows, due to their 'order queue', they may well (forcefully) deliver after 6-8 hours.\n\nPoor service is one thing. Lies on top of lies to refuse mistakes are an altogether different thing. Wishing the pandas all the best with their zillion orders.

The chicken tikka was a disappointment we ordered chest pieces but they said they were out of chest pieces so we forced our selves to have the leg pieces which were dry ... small and it didnt have the real chicken tikka kick like it used tooo.. The last meal really changed my mind about bots ... The crabs which used to be my favorite were horrible!!! Had a bite and it smelt awful .. Smelt like dead fish! ..

And I don't doubt that for a bit. I have been dining in some of Do Darya's best-kept secrets for many months now, and I must say it's quite an experience. This so-called food revolution happening in the area has seen many of the country?s best new restaurants sprouting like mushrooms in this scenic area. And for those of you searching for a culinary experience like no other, look no further than Sajjad restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant is renovated recently with the special addition of huts on the sea, unlike other restaurants who have the seating arrangements / tables quite off the sea area. However, the interior will remind visitors of a minimalist. The decor allows the simplistic beauty of the food to really shine, though beauty isn't the only thing bringing folks to Sajjad. The restaurant buzzed with excited energy and was comfortably full with seemingly satisfied patrons.\n\nWhen we reached there, we witnessed an unusual rush and a lot of cars parked already including rushing media vehicles and few dozens of private security vans. When inquired, it was revealed that some ministers and a lot of media, like a bee looking for a beautiful flower, were there. The restaurant's capacity is maximum 800 people and i was Gobsmacked when the person on the welcome desk told us that there are already more than 950 people there, a lot others willing to stand and few desperate to sit on the grass and pay the full amount. Early reservations always save us from embarrassment especially when one is accompanied with friends or guests. Similarly; the timely reservations made earlier on the day, we were induced to our table with a reservation platen / tablet. The placement of  our table was actually the starting of the stupendous experience we have had later last night. It felt that we were in the middle of the sea. The best part was not only the comfortable sofa and lighting but also the privacy. When we go to the other eateries located at Do Darya, the placement of tables or seating arrangement is too congested /crowded. One can easily hear what the other person is talking on the other table. Fortunately, that was not the case there. Also the lamp which lit the table was soft and did not hurt the eyes. There was a bottle of Hand Sanitizer on all the tables.  \n(Picture is attached) \n\nFOOD\nFor Iftar, nicely packed dates in a plate were served with Roohafza Sharbat in milk/water. The Rooh afza Sharbat actually brought back a lot of child hood memories and it quenched our thirst while breaking the fast. Since there was rush; as mentioned earliar and the typical buffet mentality, to fill the plates unnecessarily and the competition, look I have the most on my plate! the items for Iftar finished quickly. Lo and behold, it appeared the staff was well trained to deal with such panic stricken crowd and situations, in few seconds, another serving was brought. Believe you me, fresh and more quantity than before. I detest to mention this here but I witnessed with my own eyes that people who were there in their Chauffeur driven cars, filled another plate and called their drivers to have it. The staff still did not say anything and it seemed their smiling faces spoke a lot. Literate, Ill-literate and A-literate :)\n\nMy friends and I went for namaz and decided to take the Iftar items, if left by the mob, after namaz. To our utter surprise, the restaurant staff kept on refilling the items, fresh and sizzling hot, after namaz too unlike other restaurants where they do not refill after namaz and focus only on dinner items once the fast is over. By the way, they had Wazu place and proper arrangements for both ladies and gents for Namaz/prayers.\n\nThere were almost nineteen (not really sure and please blame my taste buds) Pakistani dishes for dinner. Starting from Sajji to Lamb ( Kuzu Tandir Aakha dumba or Grilled meat of lamb) Prawn Tempura, Fish, Live BBQ items , Live all sort of Tandoor/Naan,  Nehari, few different types of Biryanis and a touch of continental food in form of 3 to 4 chicken and beef items, Cheese Pasta, variety of Chinese and honestly there was so much, I have forgotten the names already. The taste was divine! No exaggeration but I have never tasted such delicious food in my life ever. Not to forget, all that happening where that competition going on in the crowd, who has the most food on one?s plate! :D I would rate 10 out 10 to the food.\n\nThere were different variety of salads and all the dishes had a name tag. There were a few desserts, but they finished quickly so waiting was the only option. While we were waiting, we saw Kakark Dooh Patti Chai (tea) being cooked live. What else could caffeine lovers dream of? Not to forget, very few places where Tea is part of the Buffet. We all had our tea and mean while dessert bar was set up again. My rating for dessert is 7.5 out of 10.\nThere?s no doubt at Sajjad Restaurant will quickly become the hottest reservation in town! \n\nAlbeit there were Janitors cleaning the over all restaurant then and there, one thing Sajjad Restaurant people should work on is cleanliness in the rest room. I am just not writing this here likeother  people who have bad experiences of other places and without talking to the concerned people of the restaurant, they mention it here. Actually I spoke to the restaurant staff near the wash room area and told them about it, where they told me about the huge crowd using the loo,  and the reason was valid. It was not surprising for me when they told me that they place napkins/ tissue papers time to time but there are few customers who do not hesitate to take the tissue roll /napkins, hand sanitizers and place it in their pockets or bags! After all they pay a good amount; so, without any judgement, according to them, they are entitled for the toiletries as well! :-)","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-07-20T01:25:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-20T09:21:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"535211286","name":"Abdul Aziz Anis"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"611818619","name":"Humaira Shakil"},{"id":"100001715666710","name":"Razak Latif"},{"id":"1049298397","name":"Sadiya Naveed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"100001098310753","name":"Ashfaq Parekh"},{"id":"1170084800","name":"Ammaar Ahmed"},{"id":"761278691","name":"Abdullah Soomro"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"657151302","name":"Nishat Mustafa"},{"id":"509686069","name":"Hasaan Mubasher Sheikh"},{"id":"619270706","name":"???

We ordered dry beef chillie, chicken chowmein, prawn balls, kungpao chicken, american chopsuey and sweet and sour chicken. Everything was uber delicious esp the chowmein, prawnballs and beef chillie dry. Prawn balls were lovely golden, crispy from the outside, soft with prawn chunks inside. Not doughy/chewy, instead melted in the mouth. Beef was perfectly stir fried, succulent and v tender. Order time was apparently 1.5 hrs but was delivered in 50 mins. The best part is its relatively more reasonable and good value for home delivered chinese. Was delivered piping hot.

First went to Log Inn lounge for their famous burgers. We were informed by the waiter that he will be able to take our orders not before 25 min and then it will be additional 15-20in before he will be able to serve us. So we left from there and went to look for another restaurant in the same vicinity. Ended up at the sports bar in the basement of Kamamishi. The sports has been converted to cavaili lounge. It was a HORRIBLE experience. The place was gaudy and interior decorators nightmare. With red and purple lights and Cheetah print sofas it looked like a set from a B grade movie. Hunger made us stay and listen to kishore kumar weepy songs. We ordered corn soup, lemonatto drinks, beef tippenyaki, spicy chicken wrap and grilled chicken burger. Out of all the food the burger was eatable. Beef was cold and chewy. Wrap was dry. Soup was just starch. They served dinner when we threatened to leave after waiting for more then half an hour.

Mirage is the only buffet themed restaurant at Do-Darya and is located right next to Kolachi. The ambience is nothing to write about as it?s almost the same as Kolachi, Charcoal, etc. We booked the whole upper deck unanimously for the view and later regretted the decision as the main food stations were downstairs.\nThe food stations are divided into 3 areas. The main food station is at the entrance while the BBQ section is at the upper left corner of the restaurant. The dessert and salad bar is in the top right corner.\nFor the price (Rs. 1000 per person inclusive of 1 soft drink) the food was very good. There were fresh batair?s (better than Lal-Qila?s), fried prawn tempura, Chicken Biryani, Goan Fish Curry, Chapli Kabab, pani puri are just some of the dishes that were tasted. The highlights however were the BBQ and the live chicken Karhai. The BBQ consisted of Chicken Malai Boti, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Chicken Tikka and Beef Namkeen Boti. The Malai Boti was succulent (but a little sweet for my taste) while Reshmi Kabab and Tikka were awesomely cooked (and Thank God not overcooked)  bu the Beef Namkeen Boti stole the show as it literally melted in our mouths.\nThe Karhai also has 4 varieties namely Peneer White, Peshawari Red, Green Masala and Namkeen Red Karhai. All four varieties were delicious and much better than what Kolachi serves.\nThe let down at Mirage were the salad and dessert station due to same variety as other buffets and also fried fish and the pasta dishes.\nOverall we really enjoyed our food and had a fantastic evening. Best part was that there was no hassle from the waiters or the mangers to clear the table (like they do at Kolachi & Ginsoy).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-27T18:52:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T09:29:10+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"736425186","name":"Maryam Zahoor Ansari"},{"id":"772910592","name":"Shyam Sunder"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"100000226962956","name":"Sumiaya Arif"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"711050864","name":"Abdul Raheem Khan"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"NzM2NDI1MTg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"548935991824222","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Aaquib Arif","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-27T21:28:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"549210141796807","from":{"name":"Zarfras Siddiki","id":"100003898006618"},"message":"seems they(Kolachi and Ginsoy) are quite busy in their business and they care for walk in customers,to avoid waiting in queue,,caring for customers by Kolachi and Ginsoy thats good,,","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T08:19:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549233218461166","from":{"name":"Muhammed Umer Mulla","id":"595408686"},"message":"Well yes but what if you are in thr middle of a meal and the bill is presented to you or when you try to relax the waiter constantly remind you to clear the table as they have a big cue....I mean can't they wait for say 5 mins","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T09:48:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549380488446439","from":{"name":"Sumiaya Arif","id":"100000226962956"},"message":"I second that muhammed umer mulla","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T14:42:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549876995063455","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"5-7 Mins should be max before which the Bill sould be asked for & settled.

The owner insisted that I should have the Cheese Naan fresh from the Tandoor rather than doing a takeaway.  Had it fresh from the Tandoor, 20 minutes wait so the Naan could be prepared and boy it was so good that I decided to scrap the idea of takeaway and asked the owner to serve me the Qeema Naan also there.  The freshly baked Qeema Naan (available in both mutton and chicken) is probably the best available anywhere in town.  He also suggested at that I should try the Croissant Naan ( this will go great dipped in a karak doodhpatti).  Also tried a Aaloo Naan which was also terrific (picture posted) with a lovely filling of green masala and chillies with potatoes.

Most of them are not local. We ordered Mutton Biryani, Chicken Handi and Lab-e-Shireen from Food Centre and Kunna from Advance Food Centre at Phase 2 (as recommended by some of the hub's friends). For biryani and Kunna, we provided the meat for these 2 dishes. \n\nFood centre guy told us that they will cook 7kg of meat and 5kg of rice for our guests of about 50 people (adults + children), 4kg Chicken Handi and 4kg Lab-e-Shireen. As for Kunna, we ordered a 5kg one.\n\nI am happy to mention here that Food Centre and Advance Food Centre did a really good job. The biryani was so delicious with just the right taste of spices, not too spicy and it just got that \"kick\" when u eat it, everyone was praising it and some even asked me for their contact no. Chicken Handi was a hit too and not forgetting the dessert, which was also whipped up in no time. Kunna was good too though some of them prefer the Kunna they had tried at Chiniot Pakwan.\n\nOverall a great experience ordering from both and most important of all, the guests left with a smile on their faces :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-10-30T11:24:00+0000","updated_time":"2012-10-30T11:25:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzNTIzNjMzOQ\u003d\u003d","before":"MTA5ODQwOTE3MQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"453423278042161","from":{"name":"Gauher Taj Raza","id":"1135236339"},"message":"Love food centre !!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-10-30T11:25:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDUzNDIzMjc4MDQyMTYx","before":"NDUzNDIzMjc4MDQyMTYx"}}},"restaurantName":"Biryani"},{"id":"165861103465048_452981858086303","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Imran A Razak (at your request)\n\nNoodles - glass rice or buck wheat\n\nPasta, Lasagne, Angle Hair, Linguini, Mac'n'Cheese fettucine\n\nYeah I know everyone is drooling and envisioning lots of yummy colourful and flavourful dishes.\n\nLets list all the ones COMMERCIALLY available in KARACHI and which ones is your favourite.

Have had Fuchsia couple of times in the past week followed by the ever tantalising and unparallelled chicken biryani from none other than Cafe Students. Today it was Chinese. Frequent diners at Golden Dragon have spoken really high about this place so I decided to give in & let G.D play with my taste buds. Today was the second time I ordered in from there. I didnot find the deals attractive since I'm not a fan of atleast 2 out of the 4 dishes they offer in those deals. So, I selected & ordered 3 dishes from their menu online: The ever famous American Chopsuey, Kung Pao Chicken (on basis of strong recommendations by family & friends alike) along with a Thai item, Chicken in Coconut Red Curry. Food was delivered exactly in the one hour time that was communicated to me. The rider (unlike the ones at most of the other food delivery restaurants) had no problem locating my address. As per my instructions, the rider did not ring the door bell, instead called on the mobile number fed in the restaurant's computer system. (This was worth mentioning because I've experienced some major mishaps with riders from Dominos, Mc Donalds, Subway etc. ringing my doorbell & calling my name inspite of having the order takers make special note to NOT ring the doorbell, as it would awake my entire family in the middle of the night, & instead to call on my cell once they are at my doorstep; but all efforts in vain!)\n\n Anyways, food as expected, was delivered piping hot, in the most convenient packaging. It looked & tasted scrumptuous! The quantity was sufficient for 5 people. Family loved every bite of it & endlessly sang praises! Beginning from the order taker whose cooperative behavior & courtesy makes u feel cared for, to the chefs & service staff in charge, till the rider who assures ur delivered the ordered items in perfect timing & perfect condition,, Golden Dragon, ur doing a WOW job! When I'm baffled with what to order, you come in at the right time and make life easier! Got to tell u, u ROCK!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-10T21:02:02+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-11T15:46:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000522564819","name":"Imran Bahadur"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"849555062","name":"Hira Aslam"},{"id":"1258402550","name":"Ateeka Ovais"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQ1MzkwMTMxMw\u003d\u003d","before":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"411511492233340","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Thanks for the lovely review and kind words.

I went out to Biryani of the Seas (BOTS) last Sunday and it actually turned to be a gastronomical disaster. I was extremely disappointed because while the food wasn't horrible, this place came highly recommended by family and friends, however the food they served was nothing to write home about. Here are the highlights :\n\n1)Prawn Biryani :- We started off with a prawn biryani which we assumed to be a house speciality. They biryani that was served was unusually cold, had a very subtle hint of masala and had all of 7-8 tiny prawns (yes, I counted). I completely understand if the lack of prawn was due to the breeding season but our server said nothing of this sort to us when we ordered.\n\n2) Tawa Chicken : Things simply went downhill after the biryani. The Tawa chicken incorporated two pieces of burnt chicken and the chicken was also overcooked on the inside. I was a little confused by this dish because having had tawa chicken in other places, I assumed that they would use boneless chicken instead of a breast and a leg piece. Additionally, While I appreciated the nice kick that the dish had, the rest of the table thought that the extra spice was simply trying to overcompensate for what the dish lacked.\n\n3) Leather jacket fillet : While the fish was perfectly cooked, I couldn't even detect a hint of flavour in it, not sure if the Tawa chicken had sabotaged my taste buds by this time but this dish felt oddly plain.\n\nOn a more positive note, the honey chilli prawns were satisfactory and the assorted chicken bbq made it worth our while to dine here but on the whole BOTS turned out to be a disappointing experience. I am not sure if I caught them during an off-night or if my expectations were too highly but BOTS failed to live up to hype for me.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-16T21:42:50+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-18T15:53:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"100002402711136","name":"Tazeen Hasan"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2","before":"MTAwMDAxODU4NDUwMDEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"399064373478052","from":{"name":"Khalid Ishaq","id":"680185313"},"message":"Quite a\nSimilar experience\nHad food poisoning after my first visit to BOTS n on d second trip ordered tawa chicken which was almost burnt","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T21:53:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399066506811172","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"To each his own....I eat BOTS 3 times a week...no problem so far","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T21:59:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399094416808381","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Looks like i spoke to soon about not getting complaints for a while on SWOTS :) - But Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

It was \"Shan-masala\" made.\n4. Daal - Didn't try\n5. Mix Sabzi - 10/10 Brilliant.\n6. Chicken Khara Masala - 5/10 Bland.\n7.Creamy Pasta - 3/10 Kept this for the last. Couldn't eat more than one bite. Too much methi or something, wasn't creamy or cheesy. Totally tasteless.\n8. Fried fish - 10/10 Delish!\n9. The soup - I don't know what soup it was but it wasn't good.\n\nFor Desserts:\n\n1. The caramel biscuit was my winner tonight. Soft and crumbly with a yummy biscuit base, it was just divine.\n2. Great caramel pudding....but then haven't seen ANYONE messing that up :)\n3. Chocolate pastry was nice. But a little dry.\n4. Mom loved the shahi tukra, the rasberry shortcake and the trifle.\n5. The blueberry cheesecake was awesome.\n6. Chocolate souffl?' - nice and airy\n\nOverall, a great time at the place but having said that, it didn't match up to the high KFC gave me yesterday :D LOL!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-27T19:52:39+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-27T20:14:13+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"643405172","name":"Sarah Ashraf"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI1OTY4OTUz","before":"MTAwMDAyMzc0OTE3MDM5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"387319667985856","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"yes the fish is delicious!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-27T20:14:13+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzg3MzE5NjY3OTg1ODU2","before":"Mzg3MzE5NjY3OTg1ODU2"}}},"restaurantName":"Biryani"},{"id":"165861103465048_386562268061596","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"I was the first to post my top ten fav eateries in Karachi on the request of DocSWOT but my list seems to be lost somewhere in these posts that get updated every minute.

I've left out 5 of my favorites from this list namely Dynasty, Fujiyama, Pakistani & KababJi for the simple reason that these are not smoker friendly places and Pompei because of its location.    Have also left out Aylanto and Fuchsia that used to be on my favorites list for a long time because of late their quality has deteriorated. So here's the list in my order of preference: \n1. Xanders\n2. Sakura\n3. Okra\n4. Flo\n5. Biryani Of The Seas (BOTS)\n6. Cafe Blue Ginger (CBG)\n7. Olivetto\n8. Bundu Khan\n9. Deli\n10.

If it was piping hot it would tasted much better.\n\nThe Fish Biyani tasted exactly the same but instead of the prawn it had a piece of fried fish on top of it.  \n\nThe Dhakka Fish is supposed to be crisp if I am not mistaken, but somehow it was limp  and not crispy at all.

Ordered from BOT last night and was very dissapointed with the experience. I was told delivery would take an hour which was late by any standards, but at least you can say one was informed. However despite five follw up calls the foood did not arrive till an hour and a half later, which is way too long to wait for dinner espacilaly with a diabetic person waiting.  when he came the rider informed us that he was the only rider and hence the dealy. if we advertsie to such extents i think ncessary resources should be deployed. Due to the delay, the food was cold and unimpressive. Was particularly disspaointed with the fish biryani, which was fish on top of regular birnai as opposed to a proper fish layered biryani. the lady answering the phone seeemd to have no clue as to the whereabouts of the rider and despite promising to locate him and call me back (the fourth time i called) i never recived a call back. I had already fried omeltte and defrosted frozed food by the time the food came, which also resulted in wastage. if we are delaing with the cosumner market we need to be mindful of these consequences that cosumers have to face due to bad service.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-12T07:34:16+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-12T18:10:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000578236531","name":"Naheed Asim"},{"id":"10403487","name":"Mehreen Obaid"},{"id":"666695402","name":"Marium Ejaz Karimi"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"688336352","name":"Abbas Farid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg4MzM2MzUy","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc4MjM2NTMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"276316139086210","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi, an unsatisfied customer.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T07:54:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":19}]},{"id":"276320659085758","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"one of the rare unsatisfied customers of BOTS","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T08:07:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276321659085658","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"their delivery problems is one of their only ones. first of all grilled sea food can not travel - even the 20mins it takes to anyone's house. lets be fair. the fact it takes a long time to serve is also faced by people sitting there to order - coz certain items have to be de-frosted and that takes time.\n\nas far as biryani goes - i have not had the fish one so cant comment but LOVE the prawn one.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T08:12:42+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276322189085605","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"Prawn Biryani is the trademark of BOTS.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T08:15:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276322875752203","from":{"name":"Najam Malik","id":"610590030"},"message":"its best if eaten then and there. takeaway not recommended!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T08:18:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276323925752098","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Nadiya...thanks for sharing.
