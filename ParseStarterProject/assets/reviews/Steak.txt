We had to return two of the items because they could not even get the grilled chicken right. And to consider that we pay nearly double the amount for an ordinary quality of the same steaks we get at any other steak house in town. The peri peri sandwich was good. The shroom burger has literally a thin slice of bland chicken in it. The buns were crumbling too. And the icing on the cake was the 10% service tax amounting to a Rs. 900 that was included when we only ordered for a party of eight. It was courteous of them to not let us pay that IF WE ARE OUT OF CASH. All in all. Excellent service. Quite average food. Ambience was okay.

Kolachi has really awesome food and is THE restaurant experience in the Phase 8 strip, if not the whole of Karachi itself. I love the new first-come-first-serve system, now we don?t have to go back disappointed learning the whole place is booked. After waiting a mere 5 minutes for our table we got a nice table on the deck. We ordered Lahori Fish as starters and although I am not a seafood fan but those finger fish are something special. They were tangy, slightly crispy and the sauce given with them complimented the dish excellently. For the main course we ordered the Kolachi Special Steak (Chicken), Paneer Reshmi and Chicken Turkey sandwich. The Kolachi Special Steak in beef is my humble opinion the best steak available in Karachi and the chicken one has come to par with it. The Paneer Reshmi with garlic and roghni naan was a delight as ever, however for our own guilty indulgence we also had it with paratha. The Chicken Turkey sandwich was a light yet fulfilling meal and tasted as a sandwich, I?m glad they don?t overdo it or give a small sampling, they just provide with what is expected in a good sandwich. I ordered the blue margarita drink which I enjoyed with my steak. My diet conscious friends had lemongrass tea after the meal and according to them it helped settle down the food, however my greedy tastebuds would only go for a sweet dessert after a good meal. We ordered Zafran and Pista Kulfi and again, Kolachi did not disappoint by giving an authentic taste yet a familiar feeling to the food that just makes you fell in love with it. You guys must have guessed that we are fans of Kolachi (like so many other people who have no complains with the place). The service is great, friendly and cooperative and seeing the ambience and quality, the price is very economical. I would suggest this to anyone who wants to have great food and a good time outside with friends/family.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-11T10:30:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-12T19:40:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"690005614","name":"Owais Asif"},{"id":"1235509862","name":"Haris Shaheer"},{"id":"100002945595749","name":"Hasanaat Tahir"},{"id":"100001692215891","name":"Usama Saleem Ahmed"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"564100900","name":"Fawad Hai"},{"id":"697750147","name":"Mohammad Ismail Asif"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"},{"id":"100003216046346","name":"Shezi Memon"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"635150123","name":"Aamna Bilal"},{"id":"753624574","name":"Shazmeen Raza"},{"id":"501828478","name":"Fatima Khalid"},{"id":"559218922","name":"Moazzam Husain"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"691898803","name":"Shoaib Haider"},{"id":"48921867","name":"Anum Shahid-Ahmed"},{"id":"518748331","name":"Zia Saeed"},{"id":"100005334067873","name":"Maqsood Ahmed"},{"id":"681193111","name":"Shiraz Sheikh"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100000009435773","name":"Maliha Bhimjee"},{"id":"773317577","name":"Abdul Hafeez"},{"id":"100002505633547","name":"Umme Kulsoom Khalid Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNTA1NjMzNTQ3","before":"NjkwMDA1NjE0"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_648204665230687/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTAwMDAyNTA1NjMzNTQ3"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"648216098562877","from":{"name":"Asad Ali","id":"100004754353439"},"message":"helo fizza","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-11T11:20:28+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"648216148562872","from":{"name":"Raabi Rehman S","id":"649638362"},"message":"Its one of THE BEST places in KHI \u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-11T11:20:41+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"648216481896172","from":{"name":"Asad Ali","id":"100004754353439"},"message":"hi raabi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-11T11:22:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"648216655229488","from":{"name":"Raabi Rehman S","id":"649638362"},"message":"Dont have much to do tharki?

It is still the saddest and driest burger ever known to man. It's drier then the sahara desert. The lettuce this time was fresh though. \n\nThe Whoopers are a complete different story! I can easily say they tasted very close to the international taste. Was fresh, juicy and perfectly cooked. \n\nThe fries were better at the Sea View branch. The ones over here tasted very average.\nI'm surprised at the taste difference in both the branches of the same place.

Kept the temperature at medium welldone. This steak I had today at Monte Cristo just renewed my love for succulent beef fillets. Nothing seemed to be out of order. Everything done to perfection. The 2nd entre was Pan grilled snapper and boy they did it real good. Soft, chunky and grilled with care. The fiesta ended up on their delicious chocolate brownie sundae which again was not bad at all. Ambience is quite appealing with nice music, neat decor and clean silver and china. The place is a nice addition to Karachi's fine dining directory. It is located on a few house ahead of HLS, oishi sushi etc.   Monte Cristo gets a 9/10 for sure........","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-30T18:45:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-31T19:50:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001172477386","name":"Haaniya Saad"},{"id":"514392526","name":"Mahnaz Fahad"},{"id":"610671062","name":"Miriam Arsalan"},{"id":"502087155","name":"Bilal Godil"},{"id":"565944483","name":"Saadya S.

Dinner at Forty4 after a hiatus of more than a year, and failure to reserve space at Okra.  The place is meticulously done, with adequate lighting, formal (yet cozy) interior, and impeccable service.  \n\nThe menu is inventive, and is probably one of the better ones in the city.  More importantly, the place didn't have Moroccan Chicken, Tarragon Chicken, or any 'Chicken Steak' entree which shows that the management knows, and takes the food it serves seriously.  \n\nAnd yea, I was delighted to know that Forty4 has not jumped on the Wasabi Prawns bandwagon.  Was surprised to see tapas on the menu, which were pricier than Downtown Madrid, thereby defeating the whole spirit underlying tapas.\n\nThe menu is impressive, and demonstrates that the management has put in some serious effort in developing it.  All the prices on the menu ended with a '4', which makes mental calculation easier, and signifies management's attention to detail.  \n\nOrdered the Shrimp and Scallion Har Gow for starters, and the dumplings were delicious -- much better than that weird stuff that is served at Noodle House.  For the main course, the Beef Tenderloin was seasoned well, was succulent, and ensured that the 'meat' remained the star of the show.  Ordered it Medium-Rare, but was served Rare -- no complaints there, the rare it is, the better.  It was after a long time that I had some good ol' seasoned meat, with amazing sear marks.\n\nAbeer tried the Pasta44, and was delighted enough to exclaim \"If it wasn't for the power failure, I thought I was in Tuscany right now\".  The pasta was flavorful, and all the ingredients actually complemented each other.  Definitely one of the better pastas in the city.\n\nGot a 15% Discount on my RBS Credit Card, resulting in a per head cost of roughly PKR1300 -- which is fairly reasonable, given the quality of food served, and attentive service.  \n\nA flavorful experience.  Overall Rating -- 9/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-13T11:49:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-13T17:09:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501776623","name":"Shayan Shabbir Lakdawalla"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"787375286","name":"Zain Rauf"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"753624574","name":"Shazmeen Raza"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"683820727","name":"Aina Nasir"},{"id":"1423718906","name":"Saba Khan"},{"id":"677905296","name":"Shazia Carim"},{"id":"517470504","name":"Nida Ali"},{"id":"1510273456","name":"Daniyal Khalid"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"563320740","name":"Syed Tariq"},{"id":"524665437","name":"Saher Najam"},{"id":"635810442","name":"Kiran Afzal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjM1ODEwNDQy","before":"NTAxNzc2NjIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"633325330051954","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Excellent review.

Though their was no line when i went, only 3 ladies and one man still the counter was relatively crowded and two managers were arguing pretty loudly with each other in full view of the customers, and the ppl who were supposed to take the order were counting cash.\n\nAnyways finally ordered a whopper and chicken burger both meals. The whopper looked very unimpressive, it was cold, patty was super thin and dry and tasteless even the KFC frozen patty is better, total disappointment. I don't know what all this hype is about, the whopper is a disappointment, the chicken burger is like a sub, patty is decent and well flavored, was served hot and much better than beef. The fries were limp and bland, total turnoff.

The burger which is one of the things it is known for was a huge helping and tasty to boot which made us plan another trip there on the spot! Also the french fries were crunchy and complimented the meals, the baked potato on the other hand was totally overcooked to the point of resembling a mash!

Even the complimentary salad that come to the table within a minute of us settling down, was super fresh. Very generous staff and a calm and pleasant environment.

The place is just off Naheed's on Shaheed-e-Millat Road, and was formerly Arizona Grill.  Met up with an old friend there, and ordered the Flamied Grill Steak.\n\nI am generally wary of ordering steaks at a place which has Arizona in its name, or which in its menu serves more than 70% of steak entrees with random sauces.  Ordered a Flamed Grill Steak, since the description didn't enlist any sauce for it, and asked for it to be Medium Rare.\n\nWhat I was served was basically 'Beef Pasanday', and there is absolutely no way the entree can be classified as a steak.  There was no need for it to be Medium Rare, because beef pasanday are just served as beef pasanday, and not Medium Rare!\n\nWhat Grill House needs to do is add a side of potatoes, and serve some hot naan with pasanday -- and accordingly change the name of 'Flamed Grill Steak' to 'Masalaydaar Pasanday'.  I am sure that Maslaydaar Pasanday can be their best selling entree, if they can serve karak naan with it, and some raaita too, of course.\n\nThe place is blasphemy to the religion of steaks, and the beef entrees are only recommended if one is looking for a filling meal of pasanday.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-11T16:47:18+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-11T20:45:11+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"533260601","name":"Ali Shahid"},{"id":"506634707","name":"Iqra Anwar Shah"},{"id":"654231486","name":"Sami Khan"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"1664160731","name":"Amna Abbasi"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"553350590","name":"Faizan Chaghtai"},{"id":"502158910","name":"Mujtaba Karim"},{"id":"561575202","name":"Usuf Haroon"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100000087775469","name":"Arshad Shamsi"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"569950203","name":"Anis Rajwani"},{"id":"511149199","name":"Shaherbano H.

Ended up at Peking (this AWKWARD Chinese place at Bahadurabad) and I have been forced to share my review since i spent ...oh sorry wasted 1600 bucks. P.S the following pictures and reviews are about to notify serious competition to Golden Dragon, Red Emperor, Ginsoy and Chairman Mao....\nThe burger qaum (DHA/Clifton residents) is set to dine in at pricey places! Well long live all u eateries.....u guys charge for hygiene, standard and items mentioned on your menus!\n\nSo me and Shahroz Ali visited PEKING....the place was really really really shady but fully crowded with families since it was a sunday night. To my utter disappointed, the moment i opened the menu, my jaw dropped wide open! Nothing for less than Rs.500. Since i found it way to awkward (thinking i wud have rather bin to Red Emperor or Ginsoy for Chinese Dine in) i thought i'd place my order. We ordered 1 Chicken Fried Rice, 1 Lemon Chicken and 1 Hot n Sour Soup. The waiter told the servings were for 2 and my heart sank further. (so i was about to have 250 k sabzi chawal. 250 ka laal paani and nimboo murgi for 250! My hard earned Quaid e Azam :'( ) The order arrived within  15 mins while I kept observing the place. The trays they used were the steel ones used at burns road k tikkay wale....Neways this is what I got\n\nHot N Sour Soup. Simply liquid Ketchup, loaded with Hara Dhania (coriander) for God knows what reason\nLemon Chicken : Boiled chicken, cornflour in the stock as the gravy and literally half a litre lemon juice along with more lemon slices compared to the chicken\nChicken fried rice: Tasteless, completely raw veges\n\nHad a few bites and eventually got it all packed, since it got really late...ended up at Indus for Biryani! The portions were actually scanty and...v tried this place just for the heck of it.....Never Again\nFor all those who thought i can never criticize a place, here it it. I never post reviews about my bad experiences since if i just like to let go off being mean, but this place got my pukes stuck within my throat only!

The presentation was zero, it looked like a piece of dry meat placed in a platter with mashed potatoes to go with it, which looked liked uncooked pizza dough, and few boiled vegetables on the other side. Too unprofessional. Anyways I started to eat still hopeful that it might not taste the way it looks, but that was disappointment too. The taste wasn't that bad but nothing extraordinary. The mashed potatoes were too salty, out of all the things on it i liked the boiled vegetables :P. Then we ordered dessert which was Chocolate Silk Pie. It arrived with same, unappetizing presentation. The taste was good but there was nothing silky! Infact the bottom layer was so hard that I might have to stand up on it to break it. \nSo my experience at Arizona was really bad. after paying such a big amount I still left with half stomach empty. The staff was good and co-operative. Good service. But who goes to restaurant for the good service only?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-13T18:21:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-14T01:48:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001882596023","name":"Mansoor Zaheer"},{"id":"673197577","name":"Syed Talha Khurshid"},{"id":"559881298","name":"Nadia Mahasin"},{"id":"100001420487264","name":"Saqib M Ibrahim"},{"id":"651245042","name":"Falak Zahid Sheikha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjUxMjQ1MDQy","before":"MTAwMDAxODgyNTk2MDIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"602689159782238","from":{"name":"Faryal Naqvi","id":"739670623"},"message":"sadly arizona has really detoriated over time","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T18:25:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602691326448688","from":{"name":"Xaraa Aar Kay","id":"100001611544621"},"message":"the last time i went to Arizona.. it was Awesome!\ni went to Arizona at Atrium Mall...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T18:31:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602691796448641","from":{"name":"Sarah J.

Food was excellent. I ordered Chicken Kiev. Good taste the white sauce was perfect to my taste. Herb rice needed a bit more aroma. Not the best Kiev but still good. Best use to be at Copper Kettle with the perfect butter and herb filling. Other entree's included Spanish skewer chicken, Moroccan chicken and Moroccan Steak. Malt cake and chocolate fudge brownie were yummy. Overall not bad. The only hitch was the ambience. Seating needs a redo. We were a big group of 8 so they joined 2 tables which were not balanced. I like to visit places for good food as well as ambience. Service was efficient. I'd give it a 7 on a scale of 10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-10T15:58:55+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-10T15:58:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1217006900","name":"S?dr?

It was simply Traumatizing, a complete letdown, To be honest i never saw Aylanto this much empty, i think only 5-6 tables were occupied..!! \n\nOn the other note, The Waiters did a great job this had nothing to do with service.

We reached there around 2:30 and the place had quite a lot of people sitting. The ambiance at all the places on the strip is to die for esp at this hour. Anyways Ordered a Mushroom steak, friend ordered Kabuli pulao and malai boti, and vanilla and pistachio ice cream for dessert. \n\nThe Mushroom Steak: I initially wanted to order chicken tarragon but they DONOT have that on their menu so had to resort to a mushroom one. The steak was cooked to perfection just as I like it, the sauce also tasted good. They could have improved the presentation a bit, but taste made up for it.\n\nThe Kabuli pulao: Tasted amazing. Didn't try much of it though. \n\nMalai boti: was really good and soft. \n\nIce creams were similar to the ones I had at Peshawari Ice cream so if that's what you are looking you will like them.\n\nOver all: service was excellent. Very cooperative staff. Satisfying portions. They can try and improve their presentation, but what lacked there was made up by taste and ambiance. Would highly recommend for bar b q and desi items during sehri rather then steaks. Very happy with my experience. Will defiantly go again before Ramadan ends.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-07-19T23:31:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-20T10:05:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"688800233","name":"Arhama Kamal"},{"id":"100002756090051","name":"Niha Jawaid"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"1311140673","name":"Yumna Salvatore"},{"id":"735591219","name":"Ch Arslan Khalid"},{"id":"100005306882506","name":"Anisa Ahmed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"1586595597","name":"Khurram Iqbal"},{"id":"1368416951","name":"Muhammad Jamal"},{"id":"571357266","name":"Khurram Zameer"},{"id":"100000579235439","name":"Halima Mobin"},{"id":"1429600174","name":"Shumail Ahmad"},{"id":"100001715666710","name":"Razak Latif"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"551353703","name":"Jahanzeb Zuberi"},{"id":"649049339","name":"Basit Saeed"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100005736485212","name":"AK Pasha"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"286700230","name":"Umair Shafi Afzal"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100006124596459","name":"Falak Saleem"},{"id":"1361427391","name":"Rehman Baloch"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM2MTQyNzM5MQ\u003d\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_588678361183318/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTM2MTQyNzM5MQ%3D%3D"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"588679791183175","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Was a pretty good experience overall.

Minutes before the iftar, ppl started coming in.\n\nSamosey and Dahi barey were stale (in the iftari items). Rather, samosey were mixed, as in stale and fresh.. :/\n\nI liked the Chholey, they were fresh and tasty! :D\n\nThen the buffet dinner, those so called 35 dishes lol\nHot n Sour - pathetic, as if someone dropped a bottle of ketchup in there by mistake\nManchurian - as above.. bad taste\nFish and Chips - I found a hair in their fish, that I politely handed over to the waiter. Fish tasted like it was fried in a million times recycled oil (hope it was edible oil)\nChicken lolipop - :/ it was LOL-iPop, not hot or anything and not tasty at all\nSteak - the only thing i could eat. it was fairly well, but not as hot as it should have had been.\n\nI didnt try everything there, since the more I tried, the more i lost interest in eating.\n\nJumping towards the end, they brought me the comment card. I expressed what I felt like, upon which the head waiters manager (a lady) and their another head waiter or someone came to me, asking about the comments. I explained but they kept on begging, so I asked for another comment card and gave a good feedback, cause they were pretty much concerned!\n\nIm attaching the other comment card that I actually had written. (I kept it, and didnt give it back, despite their attempts)\n\nService, as in courtesy of the staff, is good.

But, this time I went with my mother. Now, I've tried their Chapli Kebabs, Nihari and all the Heaven/ Hell burgers, which is the good stuff, so I wanted something different. Anyway, here's my review:\n\nMind you, I've had amazing experiences before of this place. Nobody came to take the order, so I had to make a shout to the waiter to do so. -__- Then, as we were sitting, I just took the lid off the sugar pot, and out poured a gazillion ants. I didn't create a fuss or anything, and since I didn't take my phone, there are no pictures. However, the guy took the pot away and cleaned it up. \n\nMom ordered Fish and Chips, and I, bereft of choice, went for the Rooster Steak, which I was informed was the larger version of the Chic Steak. Didn't get the espresso shots. We also ordered fries. The first set of fries came earlier than the meal, and they were fine. Mom really liked her fish and chips too. But, the steak was a real disappointment. Being a steak lover, I was hoping for the same level or at least close to what we get at Roasters or Flo. Sadly, for the upsized version which was served on a humongous platter, I got two very thinly cut strips of chicken, with a dip that was just way too much compared to the 'steak'. The price? Same as what you'd pay at Roasters for a good steak (Wild Mushroom/ Monterrey Chicken). I fail to visualize the size of the smaller one. Then, midway through the meal, I ordered more fries, which came very late. We had long finished the meal, and since there wasn't a sign of the fries, I called the guy. He said 'fries mei hi subse ziada dair lagti hai', which was really confusing. Anyway, they arrived twenty minutes after the meal had finished and nobody was in the mood to eat by then. \n\nSo, in a gist, the fries were great, the fish and chips were great, but steaks aren't their strongest suit. Serving times were tremendously slow this night. And, nobody likes being greeted by ants the minute you sit down on a table. And, that's all. I hope Quddusi Sahab takes notice and they improve their standards, without letting complacency become a factor. Cheers, y'all.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-10T18:42:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-10T19:17:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"671250001","name":"Noman Iqbal"},{"id":"100000420764459","name":"Sana Shakir"},{"id":"604074782","name":"Farheen Jeelani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA0MDc0Nzgy","before":"NjcxMjUwMDAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"583393721711782","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"noted with concern, both issues will be sorted out tomorrow, really sorry to read, i was around but pre occupied for tomorrow, will get back to you, plz apologies to yr mother from my side","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-10T19:14:46+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"583394268378394","from":{"name":"Najm Ahmed","id":"885480695"},"message":"Yes, I saw you behind the counter.

I, along with a colleague went there for the reservations and woahh the management over there was very much concerned about the \"10% Service Charges\" as they kept on mentioning that I will have to pay 10% service charges on the bill since we are 15 people. I had no issues on service charges but did not like the way they kept on mentioning it so I had to say k \"Bhai Mil Jayein Gay Apko Don't worry\". Anyways, we went there at 6:00pm in the evening, ordered the food out of which 6 were steaks including Pepper Steak, 2 Arizona Fire Steak, Twin Steak, American something steak. Food was delivered \"Kiston Mein\" after 40 minutes. To our disappointment, all the steaks were served COLD and also they served Mexican Steak in Chicken instead of one Arizona Fire Steak. Had to return all the steaks and waited another 10 minutes for them to come back with the correct order. 4 Order were returned correctly but for the rest of 2 steaks (One of it was mine :() the waiter said that chef will have to make new steaks since they were medium rare and cant be cooked further so we will have to wait for another 20 to 25 minutes. This was the last nail in the coffin. I asked them to cancel my order and told them that you guys should not ask for service charges when you cant entertain your customers properly. You brought the food after 40 minutes, brought 1 wrong order, 6 cold steaks, made us wait further to get the food and now you are telling me that I have to wait another 20 minutes? Right after 2 minutes, waiter came back with a steak and told me that its on the house which I refused and told him that the free food tactic will not change our experience with your pathetic services. Rest of the people were done with their food by the time. Bill arrived and guess what.....THEY FELT NO SHAME IN PUTTING THE SERVICE CHARGES IN THE BILL. I have been to Zamzama's one and always appreciate their service but I must say that Atrium Mall's Arizona has shown me new horizons of pathetic services.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-07T14:57:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-08T10:40:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"672864677","name":"Aamir A.

Lil difficult to find the place as it is without any signage. Ordered Chilli Garlic Prawns, Grilled Calamari, Avacado Prawns, Smoked Salmon, Seafood Chowder, Prawn Masala from Kerala, Crab Grattin, Grilled Red Snapper with Pepperonata, Grilled Seabass and Blue Cheese Steak. Also had fresh Watermelon :) Food was very very nice and presentation was extremely good with few exceptions.....Grilled Calamari and Avacado Prawns....didn't like both. Servers were very well trained. Only other problems i noted were that since the restaurant is established in Swiss Cottages, the kitchen does not have a separate access like China Kitchen hence everything moving in/out has to pass through the service area where guests are housed and although the food quality and taste was beyond imagination...there were not many guests. I mean we were the only people there. This is probably one reason that they are closing down for lunch wef 10th June and now they will be only open for lunch on weekends. I would give food 9/10, service 8/10 and ambience 7/10. My favorites were Crab Grattin, Grilled Seabass and Grilled Red Snapper! Will sure recommend seafood lovers and I will definnitelyyyyy go again!!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-09T13:32:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-09T14:23:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"1505127873","name":"Moazzam Ahmed Amin"},{"id":"556372046","name":"Ammara Shariq"},{"id":"509568517","name":"Beenish Ehsan"},{"id":"647940246","name":"Maheen Khan Omair"},{"id":"666536302","name":"Momina Ahmad"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE2OTk1NDIx","before":"MTQ2MDIyMzIzOA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"569032789814542","from":{"name":"Haider Zaidi","id":"687255482"},"message":"Haroon Leghari","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T14:23:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100000059823691","name":"Haroon Leghari","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]},{"id":"569032853147869","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Ahmad","id":"536832784"},"message":"Good objective review.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T14:23:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTY5MDMyODUzMTQ3ODY5","before":"NTY5MDMyNzg5ODE0NTQy"}}},"restaurantName":"Steak"},{"id":"165861103465048_568636753187479","from":{"name":"Raheel Lakhani","id":"638437065"},"message":"Best steak at Arizona?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-08T14:43:52+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-09T10:34:40+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000719624590","name":"Azeem Abbas"},{"id":"550540654","name":"Murad Somani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTUwNTQwNjU0","before":"MTAwMDAwNzE5NjI0NTkw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"568640013187153","from":{"name":"Ruquia Jawed-Hammad","id":"514605350"},"message":"firesteak, from what I remember.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-08T14:49:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"568641223187032","from":{"name":"Raheel Lakhani","id":"638437065"},"message":"I had mexican once.

Forty 4 with the wife Amrah Jung Tajik. Where do I begin? The experience was out of this world. We started off with the steamed Chicken Har Kow Dumplings. They were soft, succulent and full of zing and flavor. The sauces just put it over the top. All 6 disappeared in about 2 minutes, making me wish there were more. For the main course, we both had the Prime Tenderloin Beef Steak (medium well) and replaced the Chardonnay with a special low fat sauce (specially prepared for us upon order). From the first bite it was juicy, tender and full of flavor. Reminded me a lot of the types of steaks you find abroad. Really beyond expectation. On top of that, the entire experience was complimented with quick, polite and attentive service that really made us feel special (Safdar). Thanks for a wonderful night Caf? Forty 4.

Simply for the reason we can not give in to the depression and the suppression of the powers that are trying to destroy us. \n\nThe positive side on the food front started with the red carpet opening of the much awaited the fine dining seafood restaurant HOOK LINE & SINKER. \n\nThe force behind this venture are the two dynamic gentlemen, one of whom I know well and when he wants something he will go and get it and he had once promised us a place that will be different in every way possible from what has been seen in Karachi.\n\nWell I have to admit he did it. \n\nToday was our first proper meal at HLS. Booked a table for 4 wanted to keep it simple and easy and NOT scare them to jitters. Initially had asked for the dining room, but seeing that the weather is again crispy and chilly we asked to be seated on the gorgeous deck. So far the ambiance that has been created at HLS beats the rest by a mile. It's simple elegant in pretensions and extremely welcoming.\n\nOrdered the few things we had sampled and because those were brilliant then - we couldn't wait to eat them properly.\n\n1) English style fish and chips - yum. Reminded me of the little kiosk at Victoria Station in London, where I had first had them as a kid and fell in love.....what was missing - the newspaper in which those had been served. Oh yeah the salt and vinegar for the chips. But for a fine dining place these were just the right thing to eat out in the deck.\n2) grilled red snapper peperonata - just perfect. The texture, the sauce and the seasoning. Takes one back to the rustic beaches off Sicily \n3) fried fish from the house of Khatian - except of the many many many bones in this fish......it has to be one the most amazing menu items anyone has introduced to fine dining. \n4) we did have a non seafood eater with us who ordered a very elaborate looking Caesar salad. Which she claimed was extremely good.\n\nThe desserts which we had not sampled in the previous sessions just blew us away. \n\nThe kiwi mousse was such a delight I know I will be ordering that each time I visiting HLS. the coffee mousse was just the correct texture and bitterness with a balance of sweetness. \n\nThe cheese cake has to be the best one in town simple and just perfect. \n\nLooking forward many many more eating sessions at HLS.\n\nDisclaimer: this was the first time we got to see the menu properly - it is not obviously BOTS, but it's not like the way some people have thought it would be. It's fine dining at its best in Karachi and for that it was very decently priced.\n\nFor further info check out their Facebook page and make your reservations.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/hlspakistan","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-13T19:47:55+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-17T10:17:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"728371533","name":"Ismaa Khan"},{"id":"541815815","name":"Farah Qureshi"},{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"505751528","name":"Fatima Saleem"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"767165491","name":"Zara Tareen"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1567472798","name":"Jehanzeb Sa"},{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"517511348","name":"Mian Taimur Arbab"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"731410527","name":"Aziz Noorani"},{"id":"100000059823691","name":"Haroon Leghari"},{"id":"100003672338905","name":"Umbreen Mahmood"},{"id":"706695454","name":"Zarmina Kadir"},{"id":"504520279","name":"Aamir Butt"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA0NTIwMjc5","before":"MTAwMDAxODU4NDUwMDEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"487191134665375","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"**unpretentious**","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-13T19:49:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"487191654665323","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Credit for the desserts....

Simply for the reason we can not give in to the depression and the suppression of the powers that are trying to destroy us. \n\nThe positive side on the food front started with the red carpet opening of the much awaited the fine dining seafood restaurant HOOK LINE & SINKER. \n\nThe force behind this venture are the two dynamic gentlemen, one of whom I know well and when he wants something he will go and get it and he had once promised us a place that will be different in every way possible from what has been seen in Karachi.\n\nWell I have to admit he did it. \n\nToday was our first proper meal at HLS. Booked a table for 4 wanted to keep it simple and easy and NOT scare them to jitters. Initially had asked for the dining room, but seeing that the weather is again crispy and chilly we asked to be seated on the gorgeous deck. So far the ambiance that has been created at HLS beats the rest by a mile. It's simple elegant in pretensions and extremely welcoming.\n\nOrdered the few things we had sampled and because those were brilliant then - we couldn't wait to eat them properly.\n\n1) English style fish and chips - yum. Reminded me of the little kiosk at Victoria Station in London, where I had first had them as a kid and fell in love.....what was missing - the newspaper in which those had been served. Oh yeah the salt and vinegar for the chips. But for a fine dining place these were just the right thing to eat out in the deck.\n2) grilled red snapper peperonata - just perfect. The texture, the sauce and the seasoning. Takes one back to the rustic beaches off Sicily \n3) fried fish from the house of Khatian - except of the many many many bones in this fish......it has to be one the most amazing menu items anyone has introduced to fine dining. \n4) we did have a non seafood eater with us who ordered a very elaborate looking Caesar salad. Which she claimed was extremely good.\n\nThe desserts which we had not sampled in the previous sessions just blew us away. \n\nThe kiwi mousse was such a delight I know I will be ordering that each time I visiting HLS. the coffee mousse was just the correct texture and bitterness with a balance of sweetness. \n\nThe cheese cake has to be the best one in town simple and just perfect. \n\nLooking forward many many more eating sessions at HLS.\n\nDisclaimer: this was the first time we got to see the menu properly - it is not obviously BOTS, but it's not like the way some people have thought it would be. It's fine dining at its best in Karachi and for that it was very decently priced.\n\nFor further info check out their Facebook page and make your reservations.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/hlspakistan","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-13T19:47:55+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-17T10:17:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"728371533","name":"Ismaa Khan"},{"id":"541815815","name":"Farah Qureshi"},{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"},{"id":"505751528","name":"Fatima Saleem"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"767165491","name":"Zara Tareen"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1567472798","name":"Jehanzeb Sa"},{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"517511348","name":"Mian Taimur Arbab"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"731410527","name":"Aziz Noorani"},{"id":"100000059823691","name":"Haroon Leghari"},{"id":"100003672338905","name":"Umbreen Mahmood"},{"id":"706695454","name":"Zarmina Kadir"},{"id":"504520279","name":"Aamir Butt"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA0NTIwMjc5","before":"MTAwMDAxODU4NDUwMDEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"487191134665375","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"**unpretentious**","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-13T19:49:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"487191654665323","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Credit for the desserts....

It was my wife, my brother in law, a friend and me. To start off, I would like to acknowledge the most hospitable person I?ve met in my life, Mr. Najam Quddusi. Sir, it was a pleasure meeting you and would like to thank you for your great company. Getting down to the business, my wife ordered her all time favorite dish, Fettuccini Alfredo letting Mr. Quddusi know about her specific taste and likes about the dish. My brother in law ordered the Pepper Steak and I ordered the much commendable ?Burger From Hell?. The Fettuccini was exactly as my wife had asked for and she enjoyed it to the last bit. It was cheesy, creamy and to add to the taste, it had the most wonderful strong aromatic garlic taste as asked for. The portion was too much for my wife and I was truly happy about the serving size. My brother in law enjoyed his Pepper Steak so much so that he did not even once bothered asking if we would like to try out his dish. He just enjoyed the meal as if he had been starving for days. As for my ?Burger From Hell?, sir, to tell you the truth it was one hell of a burger. The portion was exactly as I always wish for it to be; FULFILLING. It certainly did fulfill my craving and appetite. Though the burger was amazing and I really enjoyed it, I must say it certainly was NOT FROM THE HELL I BELONG TO. :P \nWith all due respect sir, I do not have anything negative to say about your burger. It definitely was delicious and had the most amazing flavors combined with the best cheese and your spices. I enjoyed and cherished each and every single bite but it?s just that my taste buds are used to having more spices and it ain?t your fault. We had a wonderful experience over all and we would rate an 8.5/10. I would personally recommend Log Inn Lounge for a good hefty ?moresome? meal. Sir, you would definitely be seeing more of us inshallah. Thank you for the wonderful evening that we had. \u003d)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-11T22:06:20+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-12T08:15:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003756103781","name":"Asif Jamil Ansari"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"611720320","name":"Quratulaien Tanveer"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"530180577","name":"Zahra Kamal"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"559845057","name":"Tabinda Salman"},{"id":"100000198281068","name":"Sana Sabi"},{"id":"626091116","name":"Mahwish Ejaz"},{"id":"736055502","name":"Erum Tariq"},{"id":"575820034","name":"Maheen Kamran"},{"id":"764425006","name":"Alisa Zulfiqar Zuberi"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"},{"id":"566660881","name":"Khurram A Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTY2NjYwODgx","before":"MTAwMDAzNzU2MTAzNzgx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"471605726223916","from":{"name":"Tabinda Salman","id":"559845057"},"message":"Najam Quddusi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-12T05:39:52+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13}]},{"id":"471612289556593","from":{"name":"Sameer Beg","id":"583446948"},"message":"wowoa!!!!

What can one say that has already not been said about this gem of a place. From the moment you enter this restaurant, you are treated like royalty on every visit. \n\nWent there with two friends yesterday that had been craving a good steak for a while and I could not think of a better place than Olivetto. All three of us had the 250 grams of Oli's Rib Eye Steak. To keep it short, it was heaven on a plate for meat lovers like we are ! From the first slice you take out of that steak till the last one, you are in for a juicy treat all the way through ! Very fulling and tastier than any other steak my friends have had here in a long time. Ended up extremely satisfied with it !\n\nWe then were treated to the delicious Chewy Chocolate Brownie, thanks to Afroza aunty which was the perfect dessert to end our dinner for the day !\n\nA special mention to the waiter we were served by yesterday. Was very accommodating and understanding with the issues we were having with one of our tables which he got replaced, twice.\n\nAll in all, one of the best dining out experiences the three of us have had in a very long time ! From the hospitality to the moment we got done with everything, it was all sheer perfection !","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-09T21:24:16+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-11T05:36:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"504392072","name":"Ali Ahmad"},{"id":"1652751344","name":"Rameen Alvi"},{"id":"1322402405","name":"Saqib Raza"},{"id":"524740437","name":"Ahsan Khawaja"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000087144502","name":"Nadia Nadeem"},{"id":"100001822097920","name":"Sara Kazmi"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"538934895","name":"Amad Ul Hasan Siddiqui"},{"id":"100001347983558","name":"Abid Qureshi"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"100001015066425","name":"Sonya Khushi"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ2NjY0NTM4","before":"NTA0MzkyMDcy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"470676492983506","from":{"name":"Abid Qureshi","id":"100001347983558"},"message":"Brilliant It was \u003c3","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-10T06:00:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"471148742936281","from":{"name":"Nayab Qureshi","id":"695776393"},"message":"What was that steak called?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-11T05:30:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"471149272936228","from":{"name":"Abid Qureshi","id":"100001347983558"},"message":"Oli's Rib Eye Steak","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-11T05:31:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"471149539602868","from":{"name":"Nayab Qureshi","id":"695776393"},"message":"Oh well it was apparently mentioned above, how did I miss it.

Situated up above Pearl Continental Hotel, the place was no less than magnificent when we walked in. The subtle ambiance, the pre-50's music playing, the extra-courteous waiters, I had a feeling it was going to be one amazing dinner. I had ordered the Chicken Dijon Steak and my friend ordered the Lobster Tail. After approximately twenty minutes of waiting, we had our food served to us. I can describe the food in one work, HORRIBLE! When a place is charging more than RS. 1000 per steak, one would obviously expect it to be amazing, but it was the worst steak I've had in the city. And don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind paying extra money if the food is worth it, sadly this wasn't even close. I would go as far as saying Arizona Grill serves better steaks than this place. It's terribly overpriced for the horrible food they serve. The portions were extra-small, and the steak tasted like something that would be made at home. I rank this high-class restaurant, not classy enough to go to.

I had not tried their awesome deals in SWOT-a-cake event but I did drool over the platters that were served to others. So we decided last night to give it a shot. \n\nPlaying it safe, we stuck to the SWOT's recommendations, and ordered the Grilled Chilliz platter, Chilliz Beef Burger, Steak Sandwich and Chicken Lasagna. The platter and the accompanying sauces were scrumptious. Irfan enjoyed his Chilliz Beef Burger (although I thought the patty was a little overcooked, hence not juicy enough), but I totally loved my Steak Sandwich. The kids, after having devoured most of the platter, had little room for the lasagna, hence could not finish it, but they loved their food too. \n\nThey also shared an Oreo shake which they say was great.. My blue colada was just ok. I could not really taste the blueberry, and there was too much food colour. There was a bit too much ice in the drink which made sipping quite a task. \n\nOverall experience was good, and I felt bad that throughout our stay there, we were the only diners there. Grilled Chilliz has a buy one get one free deal on lunch entrees while it is also coming up with some great Iftari deals.

The best thing about Gunsmoke was even though it is located in a mall, in no way it gave one the feeling... It is an entity on its own... Overall a brilliant experience, Thank You AC :)\n\np.s: AC's burger in the french 'baguette like bun' was a totally different ball game :) would recommend it highly to people who want to be adventurous with their burgers :) (I Know I would next time that I am there)\n***********************************************************\nAmbareen Khan\nDear fellow swotties..I was on the table next to yours during the Gun Smoke food tasting today. Must say I agree in most part with your reviews. However there were some issues I pointed out. Firstly the cheese nachos were too 'processed' for my taste. They were simply spicy doritos covered in canned cheese dip and salsa. I was told that corn chips were not available locally(??) and therefore they had to stick to doritos. Secondly all of us ordered our burgers with the orginal bun which I feel does not do the juicy burger justice. Again I was told that Dawn is the only option so choice is limited. Salads, a few of them like the eggplant tomato was outstanding, wheras the pasta salad lacked oomph. However would I go again? Most certainly because I feel Gun Smoke will be ironing out minor glitches in no time and will live up to expectations set in part ,but obviously not solely,by its amazing ambience...\n***********************************************************\nAdnaan Chaudhary\nGun Smoke. Perfect wings. Grilled to perfection. The grilled prawn cocktail is divine. The burger in the french baguette bun was awesome. Head grill master personally delivered. Soup was great. Salad bar needs tweaking. Service still rough around the edges. But for day one it was miles ahead of any newbie joint. Prices equate value for money. Harris and kamran sheikh. Your Genesis is standing proud and tall. Bravissimo.\n***********************************************************\nNezihe Hussain\nWhat a day. Strike, heat, humidity all combined couldnt take away the wonderful time spent with fellow swotties....lovers of food. Many a noble bovine race sacrificed their lives for todays gastronomy of protiens.\n\nAt the SWOT Opening (soft) for GUNSMOKES latest venture at Dolmen Mall Clifton, met up to sample their menu and service.\n\nThe place has a fun feel. Perfectly chilled in this weather it was a pleasure to walk into the vibrant alive place.\n\nGun Smoke is synonymous with \"hutke\" \"something different\" and they have lived up to their promise.\n\nThe food thu limitedmin option today since it was a soft opening was really good. The burgers amazing. But i resent the favoritism being shown to lumboo when he got the french baguette bun and i got the regular soft bun.\n\nThe wings thu grilled and not crispy (as i like it) were cooked to perfection and yum. The nachos on the other had were doritos (not nice) the grilled prawns on a stick were perfection and i think even the BOTS spy got some tips.\n\nA place to head to on a hot Karachi summer or just for a bite of something yum. Guns are surely Smoking this time.\n\nWell done Kamran Sheikh and team.\n\nThank you Adnaan Chaudhary for arranging the lunch.\n***********************************************************\nShaikh Fawad\nGuess u guys heard Huh??? Yeah we went to Gun Smoke's- DollmenCity soft VIP opening courtesy AC. Felt a bit superstarish walking in as a line of envious eyes watched in jealousy? or may be in just hunger, as it was Lunch time, and the smell of a burger grill may have been more of a reason for wide&wild-open-eyes than the long list of SWOT celebrities : P.... anyWho, here are the dirty details:\nMuniza and I started w/ the soup and salad. Thought the flavors of the fresh&gr8 ingredients would have been enhanced if more seasoning was applied, but a dash of salt did the trick there:)\nNachos: I really didn?t think that classic Doritos could make such gr8 Nacho?s?talk about authentic : P ? wings were gr8 & perfectly succulent but I prefer both crispy on the outside & succulent on the LogINN,) side.\nBurger: I had the Mushroom Cheese, which was awesome!!! I could tell the cooking- time was something they take into consideration, as I had a perfectly cooked patty that was soft to bite in to : ))))))))))))))))) Muniza had the Pesto Burger & from what she told me it was also excellent :)\nI personally like thick home fries, but the perfectly crispy, skinny ones offered were piping hot, and only needed a dash of salt too make it deliciously savory.\nI thought the falsay drink was fantastic, so was the mint drink, but the former won my heart, as it wasn?t too sugary yet tasted natural and very refreshing!!!\nAll?n all, a gr8 opening!!! congrats Harris, and Kamran on yet another franchise : )\n***********************************************************\nHussain Tariq\nWent on the soft opening of Gun and Smoke on the invitation of Adnaan Chaudhary - Found the place extremely welcoming and lively!! of course had the company of amazing swotties Nezihe Hussain, Shaikh Fawad his lovely wife, Ally Aadil Bhamani Ryeaan Anwar Chaudhary Luciferz Angel and many many more... since it was a soft launch so few hiccups were expected but service was perfectly fine!! Tried a spoon full of doritos in Jalapeno dip (guess they were not served as Nachos) the dip / dressing was spicy and nice..wings were nice crispy and had amazing spicy tinge to them...and for the main course had a Jalapeno burger - the meat was perfectly char grilled and burger was good though bit crumby from the top but like always I remove the soggy part the one that has extra cheese and sauce and have my patty with the top part because it is always crispier so ended up enjoying my burger a lot! The mint lemonade was little over sweet but perfect, perhaps that is how it should be if not specified otherwise! My son would be a regular there because he is a huge burger fan!! The best part about the place is its location though its part of the mall and yet its away from the madding crowd..so one does not feel that he is sitting in a mall with crowd staring at you from everywhere!! All in all a very good experience!!\n***********************************************************","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T16:27:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-14T10:19:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"711705428","name":"Basit Nasir Ahmed"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"643423090","name":"Junaid Zuberi"},{"id":"592813967","name":"Umme Hamdani"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcwMTAwMTk4","before":"MTAwMDAyOTY3NTA0MTU5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397349016982921","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Luciferz Angel Ambareen Khan Nezihe Hussain Adnaan Chaudhary Hussain Tariq Shaikh Fawad Najam Quddusi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T16:31:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14},{"id":"676177213","name":"Ambareen Khan","type":"user","offset":15,"length":13},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain","type":"user","offset":29,"length":14},{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","type":"user","offset":44,"length":16},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq","type":"user","offset":61,"length":13},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi","type":"user","offset":88,"length":13}]},{"id":"397349063649583","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"thanks","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-13T16:31:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"397352813649208","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Raheel.

I was really delighted to have such a great food. Appetizers were among the best in town. We ordered for appetizers, 44 trio, prawn gambas, smoked tomato soup, carpaccio, seafood gratin, and caesar's salad, much to my utter surprise, it was amazingly prepared and presented to perfection. I cant really comment on each individual appetizer, but in simple words.. they seem to be michelin star quality. For main course, ordered a variety of dishes, the best one among all was Chocolate reduction Steak, chardonnay steak, and sea bass. Service was to its best. I do not have a sweet tooth so didnt taste any of the deserts, but i am sure those were equally good. My first experience a few month back was really bad. But if they keep this much improved service and food quality, i would love to eat there every week. Sonia Chundrigar , i must appreciate the improvement and hats off to you guyz.

Was advised on the phone to make it 8:30 to which I showed my inability so they very kindly acceded to my request to accommodate us at 9:00 for which I am extremely grateful to the management of CK.  reached at 8:50 pm to find the restaurant empty but soon other customers started to arrive and by the time we left at around 10:00 the place was still half empty (CK management, why was I asked to make my reservation 8:30 instead of 9:00 when the restaurant was not booked to full capacity?) the servers were very courteous and the food didn't take much time to arrive at the table - 10/10 for service. Starters - Hot & Sour Soup - was liked by all 4 of us but it was a bit too sour, would taste even better if the vinegar is put on hold, Wasabi Prawns - 4 decent sized prawns fried and coated in wasabi/creamy white sauce served luke warm and Crab Rangoon - creamy crab meat wontons served cold - 6/10 for starters.  Main courses, Mu Shu Chicken - DIY paper thin pancakes served separately with chicken qeema and a black sauce - very desi stuff, Kung Pao Chicken - chunks of boneless chicken in red sauce with veggies and cashew nuts which were liked by all, Beef Steak - chunks of beef with veggies in black sauce, again liked by all, egg fried rice and chicken chowmein (very salty with excessive use of soy sauce with hardly any chicken meat in it) - 7/10 for main courses.  Prices reduced since my earlier visit and quantities much improved, the above order would suffice 5 persons easily. Total damage approx 5K inclusive of soft drinks and 16% GST.

Goes well with the Jasmine Rice. \n\nThai Khao Suey: a great spicy twist blending Khao suey with Paad-Thai. \nSteamed Jasmine Rice: No complaints. \n\nPrawn in Tamarind Sauce: Haven't quite tried anything like it before but an excellent complement to your meal. It was spicy though.  \n\nAssorted Sushi and Maki:\n\nThis included Tuna, Pink Salmon, Crab Sticks and Prawn. The Maki included California Maki, Spicy Tuna and some Deep Fried Maki. \n\nI have never had deep-fried Maki before but it is excellent and a must-have. Another must-have is the Bulgogi.\n\nThe food was sent fresh to my home in KDA-1 and travelled well and the packaging and aesthetics left no room for complaints. General portions of wasabi, pickled ginger and soy sauce complemented the meal well. \n\nTHE UPPER-CRUST:\n\nPhilly Steak Sandwich : The beef was tender and I loved the panini and the cheese. The caramelised onions are always welcome in liberal portions and there are no complaints there. The beef did, however, require a little more seasoning in terms of salt and pepper.  \n\nSpaghetti Bolognese: Tasted perfect but the spaghetti seemed to be a little broken and I had to season it with parmigiano and salt n pepper. Overall the basic flavour was reminiscent of any Italian household / home-made bolognese. So no complaints.  \n\nCroissants: That's for breakfast tomorrow morning. I am sure it won't disappoint.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-14T20:54:26+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-16T20:07:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000921262643","name":"Kanwal Irfan"},{"id":"567197680","name":"Seema Mustafa"},{"id":"617680709","name":"Fatima Ali Rizvi"},{"id":"834270064","name":"Muzna Abbasi"},{"id":"676000707","name":"Tasneem Murtazaalibhai"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"599235022","name":"Sadaf Imam"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"780381887","name":"Samar Husain"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"501859943","name":"Aamina Jahangir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAxODU5OTQz","before":"MTAwMDAwOTIxMjYyNjQz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"379226758795147","from":{"name":"Aamina Jahangir","id":"501859943"},"message":"lol same routine for me today!

Good. Very good.\n\nBut...... Upper Crust, the product can stand on it's own, it needs no gimmick. It is a quality buy in, a gourmet buy in.

Worchesire base, pepper/mint seasoning, and a mushroom garnish.  This is meat and potatoes.  I ordered the steak \"medium\" and it was just slightly pink in the middle.  Just the way I like it :). Best of all it was only 750 rupees.  THIS IS A STEAL. \n\nThe Teriyaki burger my friend had was a gargantuan.  It's BIG. The perfect size for you hungry guys out there. If your like him, you want something juicy, large, and filling.  Special note- we loved the sauce.  We actually ended up dipping our fries into it :). \n\nAll in all- I would reccomend it, and I would DEFINETELY order again.

Blue Ginger- not merely a name ?.a name that brings to mind intimate decor, with eclectic pieces knick/knacks, beautiful looking dishes served with aplomb and that taste as beautiful too! Last but not the least the host Hussain Tariq who I believe is the reason why I return to CBG. No matter how good a place is, how amazing the food is if you don?t manage the relationship with your patrons you will never earn their loyalty. I had taken my mother and daughter for dinner last Friday. And had a marvelous time. And a huge reason as how much we enjoyed the company of our host Hussain Tariq. My mom was so pleased I had taken her there and felt very comfortable and like tthe total ambiance,food and service. \nAnd now the food:  We devoured the bread tray and the dips!  We started with my fav CBG creamy garlic mushrooms- oh my?the garlic bits and the perfect smooth sauce made me literally lick the plate with the fresh garlic bread. The Tangy Prawn Skewers were perfectly bar b qued and so glad to have ordered the bigger helping of the dish! For main we took Grilled Chicken in Mushroom Sauce, Fettuccine Alfredo & a Blue Ginger Steak. Mom and daughter loved their food but I was little antsy  since if the steak is not as you like it then eating is no fun.  The steak was medium ?well done perfectly as most places I end up eating well-done!!! We finished off our meal with a chilled and delicious Valentino ( combination of pineapple & strawberry)\nSo Hussain thanks once again for a beautiful culinary experience. Look forward to a breakfast now soon.

There was cheer among the people as there were many, which normally on a weekday the area is somewhat deserted.\n\nWas surprised at the interior of the restaurant, very well done as each and every inch was well utilised. Typical japanese interior, medium sized tables, upright chairs. Dim lighting but bright enough to see the plates and the dark colored chopsticks. \n\nOutside, there were tables carved out of pure seesham and soft chairs, ideal for 3 on each side.\n\nFor starters, there was all kinds of sushi... The aroma was very much inviting but since am allergic to raw fish, had a hard time to control myself. Helped myself to pickled Ginger and Raddish. Both were simply awesome as I have never had them before in any Japanese restaurants before. Raddish was sweet in taste, with a hint of orange and lime. Loved it so much that I asked for a second serving which was promptly brought to the table.\n\nThen came huge jumbo prawns, thick juicy and covered in that special crispy batter. Couldn't resist them so had a couple. Prawns were followed by California Maki, Spicy Tekka Maki, Tori Teriyaki, Ebi Tempura, Tori Teriyaki, Oishi Gyununiku Steak, Ebi Tepenyaki. \n\nEach and every serving was prepared to perfection with exceptional taste and served by well behaved and experienced waiters who also could speak couple of Japanese greetings. It was good to hear and see that the management has gone out of their way to train their staff.\n\nOne thing was annoying though.. as a policy of Oishi Sushi, there are no plastic bottles or alluminium cans allowed to be served on the tables, hence the only water they had was Evian water in a well shaped glass bottle.\n\nA real treat of a fine dinner.. Highly recommended..","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-28T13:24:35+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-29T06:18:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"1025016220","name":"Nabila Khawaja"},{"id":"626746793","name":"Hamida Najeeb Haroon"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"850419690","name":"Nida Huq"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ1NjIwMTMz","before":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"285715041479653","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"I am being jealous as how many ppl invite u ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T13:39:17+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285716544812836","from":{"name":"Khalid Lakhani","id":"711077848"},"message":"You can invite me too...but it will have to be after coming Tuesday, till then quite busy....","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T13:43:21+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285735018144322","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"What did you have Khalid bhai :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T14:28:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285736224810868","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"SARA please dont ask for anything as for any answer, he may ask for invite ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T14:30:49+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285738491477308","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Naaa he won't..

About 4 days ago I went to LogInn Lounge and ate with Abid Aziz Merchant, Aalia Mahboob Elahi, Saeed Jamal Tariq, in the presence of the owner.\n\nOrdered the 1/2 kg Pepper Steak Plate, did not tell them how I wanted it. The result was FANTASTIC....It was Medium Done...and thats how I recommend people have it to maintain the juiciness of the cut (which by the way was a beautiful cut). The meat was tender and easy to cut through. The Pepper Steak Sauce was probably one of the best I've had in a while, it was rich and creamy with a very distinct pepper taste. The best part was the sauce was smooth and not lumpy like I've tasted on occasion in the past in other restaurants, so clearly it was prepared using the right technique.\n\nI'm a big eater so this 1/2 kg Steak is just what the doctor ordered for me (this doctor is obviously not a cardiologist). I plan to try the steak once more before I leave just so I can take the taste with me to Canada.\n\nBRAVO!!!!

Ordered the starter of the Charcoal Platter consisting of fried chicken slices with cheese, fish fingers, chicken wings & deep fried button mushrooms served with 4 dippers. That plate was emptied within mintues by 3 adults & 3 kids - verdict - yummy n felt like ordering more!\n\nMain courses:\n\n1) Mushroom Steak with mashed potatoes - It was beef, juicy and well done, served withg fantastic taste of mashied potatoes.\n\n2) Fish & Chip - 2 slices of fish fillets served with salad and fries. Quite a serving that my mom still had 1 sliced left coz she was too full. Served with tartar sauce and a dipper for the fries which was really crispy.\n\n3) Charcoal Mix Platter - enough for 2 - Grilled prawns wz sliced capsicum, small slice of lemon and onion - a lil spicy but not desi :) Steak with sauce, again juicy n yummy. Fish fillet - crispy on the outside but soft in the inside, chicken piece with white sauce - no complain and lastly their awesome mashed potatoes!\n\n4) Popcorn Chicken with fries (kiddy meal) - Big popcorn chicken deep fried just nice, crispy and juice and yummy fries that was served with it with the dipper. Had to order another one coz the elder son didnt want to share! :)\n\nDesserts -\n\n1) Brownie - Big chunk of brownie served in a tall glass, surrounded with yummy ice cream vanilla ice cream, huge portion, can be shared.\n\n2) Chocolate Mousse - smooth and chocolatey at the right amount.\n\n3) Cheesecake with caramel - Delish and with the caramel on top it added just the right amount of sweetness to it,just perfect to end our evening by the sea.\n\nGreat service, ambiance and definitely worth a visit. Will put up some photos soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-17T04:19:31+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-17T04:51:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"610590030","name":"Najam Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjEwNTkwMDMw","before":"MTA5ODQwOTE3MQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"279249205459570","from":{"name":"Mohsin E Azam","id":"622525326"},"message":"I second that...

Another bread basket however followed.  Had a full red meat meal - Beef Carpaccio (i always thought that Flo made the best beef carpaccio but this one was as good as what's available at Flo) and Pepper Steak (asked for medium and got a medium) 300 gms excellent piece of cow meat which i really enjoyed - one of the finest steaks i've had in the recent times.
