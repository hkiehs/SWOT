Heaven on earth! It was for Rs. 365 where a scoop of icecream was for Rs. 210 so this sundae definitely was worth it. I enjoyed it so much that a lady from across the table had to come and ask me what I was having and from where did I get it :D\n  I'm happy that people are finally giving much attention to good desserts because I always felt restaurants didnt give much thought to the desserts and ignoring the fact that the last dish usually leaves a lasting impression.

It was one small drive for man and one giant leap for man mind.\n\nEntered Burger King and I was robbed INSIDE the branch. You would expect something like that out on the streets in karachi. Only this time the thieves had a smile on their face and were behind the cash registers. Ordered the grilled chicken and the mushroom Swiss burger. We were warned that the mushroom Swiss would be a small burger but given the size of the same abroad, I didn't pay much attention to that. \n\nThen arrived the tiny mushroom Swiss burger, I looked here and there to see hidden cameras and that probably I was on some comedy reality show being pranked and expecting Ashton Kutcher to come out.

The access to the place is narrow service lane. The shop has a small frontage and is deep inside. It appears that the shop belongs to someone in Management with vested interest.  As a result the outlet is congested and cramped. Either BK does not expect much clientele of dine in. At the main counter ordered meal deal for Whopper with cheese. During placing of order which was quick but observed that confusion prevails in the area. \nThe taste of Whopper was good but fries reminded me of Mojeebs near Jheel Park (no more there anymore). We sat down on sofa which were comfortable but the table was small and not enough to handle one tray. \nOn top of it,  the height of the table upto your face if you want to sit in the comfortable sofa. Could not fully enjoy the taste of burger due to ill planned furniture. \nThe crampness of the place and discomfort due to furniture gave the same feeling when having seekh kababs at Waheed Restaurant on Burns Road.\nWent to the washroom to assess the admin strength and capabilities. Total failure despite a new innovative cement washbasin. Due to poor flooring the water oozing out of muslim shower accumulated in front of the door making the shoes wet. There was no supervisor card to show when the washroom was checked. The wc was dirty and almost running out of toilet paper roll.    \nPoor brand management of a great brand.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-23T21:39:52+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-23T23:56:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1109359970","name":"Altaf Suleman"},{"id":"759025230","name":"Hassan Jan"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"531760529","name":"Neha Sarwar"},{"id":"612464159","name":"Zainab Atif Kabir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjEyNDY0MTU5","before":"MTEwOTM1OTk3MA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"656364954414658","from":{"name":"Umer Rashid","id":"849920390"},"message":"I just miss chicken jumbo burger of Mojeebs","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-23T23:56:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjU2MzY0OTU0NDE0NjU4","before":"NjU2MzY0OTU0NDE0NjU4"}}},"restaurantName":"Burger King"},{"id":"165861103465048_655064087878078","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"The Burger Factory is highly recommended.

I had decided against going to another Burger King for a while.\nBut sadly was dragged to BK Nishat yesterday. Well this time my experience was the complete opposite.\n\nAs usual they didn't have the Angus Steakhouse. (-_-)\n\nOrdered Two Double Woopers with cheese and one Chicken Mc.Royale. \n\nI still stand on what I wrote previously about The Chicken Mc.Royale. It is still the saddest and driest burger ever known to man. It's drier then the sahara desert. The lettuce this time was fresh though. \n\nThe Whoopers are a complete different story! I can easily say they tasted very close to the international taste. Was fresh, juicy and perfectly cooked. \n\nThe fries were better at the Sea View branch. The ones over here tasted very average.\nI'm surprised at the taste difference in both the branches of the same place. Burger king needs to work on consistency.\n\nPlus I noticed the staff at the Nishat branch is better trained. They are quite helpful with selection and we were told that the Chicken Royale would be on the dry side.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-11-09T15:12:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-09T22:27:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"782634552","name":"Sibtain Raza Rizvi"},{"id":"100000522564819","name":"Imran Bahadur"},{"id":"100000000311471","name":"Zeeshan Mirza"},{"id":"100001010415651","name":"Why Khan"},{"id":"626070061","name":"Salman Aly"},{"id":"770944605","name":"Hasnain Hanif"},{"id":"622340233","name":"Imran Ahmad"},{"id":"571357266","name":"Khurram Zameer"},{"id":"531081230","name":"Jaipal Metai"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100001072766153","name":"Akbar Marri"},{"id":"558178102","name":"Safoora Fahad"},{"id":"100000968320453","name":"Umair Ali Khokhar"},{"id":"1037741430","name":"Shahan Khan"},{"id":"100001915683645","name":"Kanza Hussan"},{"id":"100001660620072","name":"Shumail Rafi"},{"id":"1475984626","name":"Shoaib Mohammad Quraishi"},{"id":"100000744651030","name":"Farah Sadiq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzQ0NjUxMDMw","before":"NzgyNjM0NTUy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"647463431971477","from":{"name":"Ahmed I Mehanti","id":"653913361"},"message":"Okay so it's a Whopper*","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:06:38+0000","like_count":12,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647464341971386","from":{"name":"Rayyan Sohail","id":"728987421"},"message":"\"Mc.Royale\" ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:09:48+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647465135304640","from":{"name":"Irfan Mohammad Aslam","id":"861405103"},"message":"Ayesha Khan happy iqbal day :P iqbal jee hotay to apki nazam parh kar buhat kush hotay !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:12:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"647465148637972","from":{"name":"Ibrahim M Khalil","id":"724095104"},"message":"WTF is this?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:12:55+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"647465825304571","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Ahmed I Mehanti grammer Nazi much lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-09T16:15:34+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"653913361","name":"Ahmed I Mehanti","type":"user","offset":0,"length":15}]},{"id":"647466138637873","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Rayyan Sohail I meant chicken royale.

Wouldn't mind having a more generous serving of Olive Oil, as what was served was barely sufficient for one person.\n\nOrdered the Arabic Platter, Meaty Lasagne, and Chicken Florentine for main course.  The Arabic Platter was brilliant, the lamb was moist, succulent, and juicy -- while the beef was cooked to perfection.  The pita was fresh, and the serving of Hummus was generous.  \n\nThe lasagne was a disaster -- it lacked texture, and the taste was just off.  Pizza Hut served a better lasagne once upon a time.  The Chicken Florentine was decent, but can't figure the nomenclature when it lacked the primary ingredient, i.e. spinach.   Also ordered Chocolate Molten Lava - it was grainy, and better offerings are served by other eateries.\n\nThe place levies a service charge, which basically means the patron pays a component of staff salaries, which is supposed to be built in the prices on the menu.  Soon enough, they may also start charging Generator Charges, Gas Charges, etc.  \n\nAs a policy, I don't like to go to places which have 'service charges' in place -- so I guess, I will be avoiding Olivetto for good.  If (almost) European prices are being paid in Karachi, and there is nothing special about the food -- a place is better off being avoided.\n\nOverall Rating -- 6/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-02T21:07:14+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-03T15:14:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1360134242","name":"Fahima Mubashir"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"},{"id":"1031220895","name":"M Saquib Khwaja"},{"id":"1086930427","name":"Ali Saif Memon"},{"id":"776525430","name":"Khadija Tahir"},{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"1198610816","name":"Maheen Siddiqui"},{"id":"746376004","name":"Sameen Shahid"},{"id":"851275369","name":"Belinda Fonseca"},{"id":"100001185864732","name":"Faryal Noman"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1247552277","name":"Abdullah Farooq"},{"id":"844625322","name":"Goher Zaman"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Plus they were toasted more than they were supposed to just to cover up the staleness.. Next! The meat patty was nowhere close to WHAT a BK Whopper should be, it was dry, bland, tasteless and didnt have the right sauces! Onions were over dressed! And ultmately, there were no standard cups for soft drinks.. For the same order some of us got small n the rest medium.. Plus I wonder why the were serving pepsi instead of coke! It has been a horrible exprience and very disappointed about the lack of quality to such heights! Cant imagine myself having it again anytime soon.. Might try it once the full menu is introduced..

I just found the patty of Whopper a little dry else Chicken Royale and Angus was outstanding.

I just happened to see the lines at BK at the Boat basin branch and just bamboozled by the rush. I will probably have to wait at least a couple of weeks before I can go with my family to sample BK. So I guess they can be forgiven if the quality not consistent at this time. At the same time I believe that the owners of BK same as Pizza Hut. Judging from the sad decline of Pizza Hut over the past years (especially past year) I hope they don't do the same with BK. The problem is many of these owners are only interested in profit or loss and not the passion or quality that makes a great eatery.

If BK owned by the same people who owned Pizza Hut then its bad news unless they totally revamp their quality control and dedication to providing a top quality product for a customer who had the kindness, courtesy and trust to part with his/her money for a reasonable dining experience. That's what going into the food business is all about: It's about returning that kindness and trust someone has for you and responding with the best quality possible for that money. I can't judge BK until I try it myself (maybe in a week or so when the crowds lessen a bit). Let's see how it goes. P.s. Have been a McDonald's fan ever since a kid and although we know the barrage of criticism and jokes McDonald's gets in the commercial aspect I respect them because they always maintain the quality and product, and that's especially important here in Pakistan. Only once or twice I had a bad experience with McDonald's here (stale bun) in many years. A friend of mine from L.A. who owns 3-4 Taco Bells, KFC's and a Pizza Hut there had McDonald's here and said it was far superior to any McDonald's in the US (the halal beef probably helps).","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-08T06:10:01+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"630288763688944","from":{"name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar","id":"513228889"},"message":"Why do people in our country in particular compare and expect the taste to be the same worldwide?

Though their was no line when i went, only 3 ladies and one man still the counter was relatively crowded and two managers were arguing pretty loudly with each other in full view of the customers, and the ppl who were supposed to take the order were counting cash.\n\nAnyways finally ordered a whopper and chicken burger both meals. The whopper looked very unimpressive, it was cold, patty was super thin and dry and tasteless even the KFC frozen patty is better, total disappointment. I don't know what all this hype is about, the whopper is a disappointment, the chicken burger is like a sub, patty is decent and well flavored, was served hot and much better than beef. The fries were limp and bland, total turnoff. I have not tried the Argus Steak House but will try it soon, maybe that may fares better on my scale.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-08T11:09:17+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-08T11:09:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTU0MjY2OTM5Mg\u003d\u003d","before":"MTU0MjY2OTM5Mg\u003d\u003d"}}},"restaurantName":"Burger King"},{"id":"165861103465048_629455213772299","from":{"name":"Essa Zaki","id":"579292596"},"message":"Burger King","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-10-06T12:27:48+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-08T01:53:51+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"579339516","name":"Mohammad Taha Khan"},{"id":"100000223684855","name":"Sana A.

It was home to a culinary delight of mythical proportions, called The Whopper. As time passed and consumerism ruled, places similar to Burger King started their slow but deliberate invasion of our fine country. However, as they came one after another, Burger King remained elusive. And as with all things elusive, they more it played hard to get, the more we craved it. When we travelled abroad, we would have BK at every available opportunity - in some cases, people even went to extreme lengths like buying it from the DXB airport (where it was conveniently located near gate 210, where the morning Karachi flight invariably was) so that it could be brought back and enjoyed with the family. \n\nAnd then one day, there was an ad in a newspaper, advertising jobs at? gasp? Burger King Pakistan! It has been a journey of epic anticipation, waiting (thankfully not with baited breath) until today, when I lined up with many others in the glaring sun outside BK Nishat to have my ever favourite - the Double Whopper. The queue moved relatively fast and in about 30 minutes, I was in. Another 20 minutes and I was at the counter, where I found out, to my utter dismay, that there is no Double Whopper. A minor misstep, I thought, and promptly ordered three Whopper meals and two Chicken Royale meals. There was some confusion about whether fries are being served to customers or not, as there was a shortage and perhaps fries were only being provided to customers who had placed their orders well before mine. But that was quickly sorted and I was assured that five lovely packets of fries would accompany the burgers. There was a wait of 15-20 minutes for the food to be served, although it felt like eternity. And then, suddenly, there it was: a Whopper, in front of me, in Pakistan. Fast forward twenty minutes and there you have wrappers on the trays, empty Pepsi glasses and fry packets. The fries, by the way, are absolutely mind-glowingly good. Its hard to believe they're from a fast food outlet. The burgers? are a slightly different, more complicated story. They were good, but as we left, I couldn't help but think that the whole experience was somewhat underwhelming. So I really thought about it - yes, it wasn't a Double Whopper which is what I always have, but that wasn't it. And its not as though the burgers were bad: they're just like BK everywhere else. The size is good, its a nice filling meal without making you feel stuffed. Even the Pepsi was really good :) But the problem is this: when I first visited Burger Shack, I couldn't wait to go back. And sadly, I don't feel the same way about BK. In fact, I'm not really feeling the need to go back. And I think the reason is this: we've been spoiled by offerings like Burger Shack. The advent of the gourmet burger into our lives means that as good as the Whopper is, its just not good enough. I know I'm not alone in comparing Burger King to Burger Shack - at least four people in BK were doing the same thing. \n\nIn conclusion: Burger King is, or rather, the Whopper, Angus and Chicken Royale are just like their foreign counterparts. I'm sure that the others, including the Swiss and Mushroom will be just as good, whenever they are launched. The onion rings too, when they become available, should be good. They're having a lot of management related issues right now and the staff is clearly under-trained, but that will be fixed over time. You can go to BK and know that you'll get the same taste you get everywhere else - just don't go expecting BK to blow the local offerings out of the water. Because, as I'm unbelievably proud to say, the local offerings are better. Which reminds me, I haven't had Burger Shack in a while...","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-06T12:20:33+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-07T12:06:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"569196654","name":"Maria Sultan"},{"id":"786471893","name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed"},{"id":"648091964","name":"Saba Sadia"},{"id":"732705760","name":"Nishat Aleem Khan"},{"id":"752174107","name":"Urooj Imran"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1371113498","name":"Danyal Sopariwala"},{"id":"571881277","name":"Sna Nm"},{"id":"565157664","name":"Sarah Farooq"},{"id":"100000223684855","name":"Sana A.

Picked the burgers up from the 'shack', and had the 'Full House' with Loaded Fries.  The order was ready in like 15 minutes, despite a lot of demand.  They were easily churning out a dozen burgers every 5 minutes.\n\nThe succulent beef patty was probably the best I've had this side of the Suez, and is clearly a couple of notches better than the standard burgers served by fast food joints, including international franchises.  The bun-patt ratio was just perfect, and the buns were fresh.  The condiments were not overflowing, and complemented the overall taste.  And finally the price was pretty reasonable, relative to burgers served by fast food franchises.  Not much to write about fries -- they were just the usual fries, cut in a fancy way.  It will be great if they can provide a choice of burger buns as well!\n\nThe burger can't really compete with gourmet burgers, but its probably the best fast food burger out there, and definitely way better than the eagerly awaited Burger King, and the now mini-Mac of McDonalds.  Hardees is in a different league though, as the patty there is charbroiled. \n\nOverall, a good experience.  Would rate it at 8/10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-04T01:06:05+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-04T20:00:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"512577683","name":"Salik Sajid"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"810870516","name":"Talha Sufi"},{"id":"901860640","name":"Mohammad Rafil"},{"id":"557576643","name":"Shariq Riaz"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"1579891410","name":"Erum Siddiqui"},{"id":"712751198","name":"Zareen Sultan"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"547005284","name":"Adeel Azhar"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"593385155","name":"Mubashir Zuberi"},{"id":"828050472","name":"Maisam Ali"},{"id":"568465423","name":"Yasir Hasan"},{"id":"500172130","name":"Agha Hamza Pathan"},{"id":"544070599","name":"Farhan Saleem"},{"id":"1285044693","name":"Sami Ibrahim Tamimi"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"600961078","name":"Azzah Sharif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAwOTYxMDc4","before":"NTEyNTc3Njgz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"597862913598196","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"nice review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-04T03:02:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597868500264304","from":{"name":"Em Jay","id":"100000065623735"},"message":"Onion rings are much better than their ordinary fries","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-04T03:22:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"597869446930876","from":{"name":"Adnan Yasin","id":"723675110"},"message":"Every burger chain has its own uniqueness except for those who are completely waste of money.\n\nThose who are good ...have at least one burger of different type.\n\nHARDEE'S ......
