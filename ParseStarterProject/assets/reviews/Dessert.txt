My friend came across \"The Saucy Mistress\" while surfing on Facebook and ofcourse, for people like me, who cant eat their daal chawal without lassan and raita, the page was simply a chutney lover's delight. \n\nI am always on the lookout for the perfect dip for my Lays Salt and Vinegar chips.. so I decided to get their Two Days in Parts dip which boring people call French Onion Dip. The thickness and richness of the dip was mouth-watering.. \n\nThen for my daal chaawal, I decided to try Maula Jatt! which was their Lassan Chutney and since I got a lil bit more greedy I also got the Green Card Fever which is commonly known as the Coconut Cilantro Chutney. Teehee. The freshness of the lassan, cilanto and coconut in both the chutneys is clearly noticeable. \n\nMy friend, on the other hand is a coffee lover, so she got Up, their Tiramisu dip. It looks so thick, rich and delicious, but unfortunately I didnt get to taste it so I cant give a verdict. \n\nOne thing I LOVE about The Saucy Mistress is that her innovative  and hilarious menu makes you want to keep going back to her Facebook page and reading it out loud and she is always so positive, encouraging and shares the making process of the chutneys on her Facebook page. \n\nSpeaking of which, she doesn't just make chutneys. Her diverse list includes Cooking Sauces, Dips, Dressings for Salads and Desserts.\n\nMust must try for all! Highly recommended!\n\nThe Saucy Mistress","type":"status","created_time":"2014-01-07T10:41:39+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-09T01:47:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001249609169","name":"Leah Dhaduk"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"100005564322095","name":"Aiza Shahzad"},{"id":"694261816","name":"Muzna Amjad"},{"id":"1072386248","name":"Jamal Azfar Khan"},{"id":"1032941953","name":"Adnaan Chaudhary"},{"id":"524111275","name":"Zainab Dossa"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1575511157","name":"Ayesha Wajid"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"717445135","name":"Rukaiya Karim"},{"id":"1449229417","name":"Muhammad Fareed Usman Dhaduk"},{"id":"1479970293","name":"Faiza Jawed"},{"id":"638898227","name":"Rehan Lakhani"},{"id":"735535569","name":"Atif Butt"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"733018407","name":"Nabeel Kazi"},{"id":"100000784637550","name":"Rida Salman"},{"id":"790100289","name":"Aimen Liaqat"},{"id":"100003141819096","name":"Nazia Mushtaq"},{"id":"100000999733392","name":"Hadi Khan"},{"id":"100001640822737","name":"Khadija Jatoi"},{"id":"48921867","name":"Anum Shahid-Ahmed"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA0NzY0Njc0","before":"MTAwMDAxMjQ5NjA5MTY5"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_678840632167090/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTA0NzY0Njc0"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"678856335498853","from":{"name":"Rameez Javed","id":"582077107"},"message":"Great review. 20% off for sure! :) \n\nI definitely will try this out!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-07T11:02:02+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"678857492165404","from":{"name":"Rahila Najaf Nizam","id":"504776217"},"message":"Oh I got 20% off on this order too cuz they couldnt deliver yesterday due to some strike issue :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-07T11:06:44+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"678866548831165","from":{"name":"Rameez Javed","id":"582077107"},"message":"Lol.

Though it was more on the spicy side for me.\n\nI did not try the other one but according to another fellow swottie it was also quite good.\n\nStarters:\nFor starters we had Chicken Drumsticks, Prawn balls and Prawn Toast.\nThe starters were cold initially but after requesting them to change it we were served with fresh hot ones. \nPrawn toast was a personal favorite .\nI found the prawn balls to be quite bland.\nThey being cold ruined the taste for me a bit.\n\nMains:\nFor Mains there was\nChicken Manchurian:\nMy much raved about personal favorite. Was a Disappointment at RE. The CM lacked gravy and was quite dry and too sweet. But had generous amounts of chicken. It was more of a mashed mush rather then a saucy Manchurian.\n\nBeef in Oyester Sauce:\nDefiantly got me going back for more. Was super yum soft and moist. Bit on the oily side though.\n\nVegetable in Coconut Curry:\nTasted okayish. The veggies were cut quite large making it hard to eat.\nThe coconut curry was an interesting blend of flavors though.\n\nVegetable Chowmein:\nAgain I found it quite bland. Nothing to write about.\n\nThere was one more dish I'm forgetting.\n\nDesserts:\nThere was 5 kinds of desserts \nChocolate moose. Cheesecake \nCustard. Fruit chat. Walnut muffins.\n\nThe cheesecake was loved by everyone.\nI personally loved the chocolate moose.\n\nFRUIT CHAT on a Chinese buffet. Like seriously bhai kia chah rahay ho. Iftari thori hai :P \n\nOverall:\nHad an amazing time meeting up with the people who share the similar love for food. \nThe food was quite cold would have appreciated warmer servings.\nFor taste I would give it a 6/10\nChoice of dishes 5/10\n\nService on the other hand was exceptionally good.\nMeeting the owners themselves was quite pleasent.\nLoved our complimentey cups of greentea.\n\nPriced at 1100 per person. And promising 20+ dishes we found it quite disappointing in aspects of choice of dishes and taste.\n\nWould I go back for the buffet? NO.\nWill I go again because of their service at another time perhaps. YES.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-11T12:42:09+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-12T07:45:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"100001082786735","name":"Mahjabeen Khan"},{"id":"739935375","name":"Umer Latif"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"762775146","name":"Syed Faraz Baqar"},{"id":"524501080","name":"Zohaib Ali Memon"},{"id":"1107436825","name":"Xa?id Waqar"},{"id":"577774492","name":"Osamah Nasir"},{"id":"568861941","name":"Hassan Ahmed"},{"id":"1175769579","name":"Mohsin Mohiuddin"},{"id":"612945508","name":"Umair Shabbir"},{"id":"1282983841","name":"Hamza Kapadia"},{"id":"500786387","name":"Durand D'Silva"},{"id":"100000114960083","name":"Irfan Lala"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"100000238497030","name":"Madiiha N Narrejo"},{"id":"733018407","name":"Nabeel Kazi"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"709830622","name":"Saqib Pervez"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzI3NzkxMjA1","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc0MDgxMjMx"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_665038480213972/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzI3NzkxMjA1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"665040426880444","from":{"name":"Muhammad Abdullah","id":"1289258274"},"message":"Throughout the review your praising it but why so less score :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:47:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665041133547040","from":{"name":"Yasir Billoo","id":"807675696"},"message":"She is mainly praising it cause of the awesome company she was with :D right Ayesha :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:49:10+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha","type":"user","offset":77,"length":6}]},{"id":"665041723546981","from":{"name":"Muhammad Abdullah","id":"1289258274"},"message":"I'm sure, must have been fun.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:50:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665042180213602","from":{"name":"Mazahir Ali","id":"520175866"},"message":"Another cake in the making.... :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:51:58+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665046013546552","from":{"name":"Fareha Zarsheen","id":"612250309"},"message":"I tried red emperor just once before n didnt like it much.

The food was excellent! \n\nIftar started light with normal samosa pakora, rolls, channa chat, dahi phulki, fruit chat and gulab jamun. Not to forget bottomless soft drinks, water, tea, coffee and rooh afza. 7 on 10 for iftar. \n\nDinner had a wide range of desi and continental dishes. At least 30 dishes and all tasted really good. 10 out of 10 for dinner. \n\nDessert bar had 4 different cakes, kheer, custard, gulab jamun, a pink mithai, pudding, ice cream and even a sugar free sweet. So it gets a 8 out of 10. \n\nConsidering the amount of people they were dealing with the service was pretty decent. So they get a 9 out of ten for it. \n\nAll in all a very decent iftar and dinner and a very good experience. Highly recommended if you are a true foodie.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-26T18:23:21+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-27T15:23:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"670615540","name":"Khurram Wahab"},{"id":"1511554294","name":"Huma Mohiuddin"},{"id":"100001646261903","name":"Sheikh Yousuf Saleem"},{"id":"698359177","name":"Mashal Iftikhar"},{"id":"100001410540814","name":"Muhammad Awais Shaikh"},{"id":"520882045","name":"Ghulam Ali"},{"id":"632605191","name":"Faraz Ali"},{"id":"711950562","name":"Kashaf Imtiaz"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100004345385201","name":"Syed Sharjeel Tirmizi"},{"id":"583962068","name":"Sharmeen Khan"},{"id":"1536502506","name":"Aniqa Tehreem"},{"id":"649390400","name":"Amber Zulfiqar"},{"id":"100001791795192","name":"Asma Aly"},{"id":"645099594","name":"Mujahid Iqbal"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"750786806","name":"Faixa Shah"},{"id":"1013437557","name":"Farhan Hafeez"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAxMzQzNzU1Nw\u003d\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"592994090751745","from":{"name":"Farhan Hafeez","id":"1013437557"},"message":"Totally AgreedI havent seen such a luxurious dinner menu in any Ifatris i hve been to uptill Now. indeed an amazing experience!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T18:25:52+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"592995050751649","from":{"name":"Mahvish Khalid","id":"1331684362"},"message":"how much per head","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T18:28:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"592995627418258","from":{"name":"Mujahid Iqbal","id":"645099594"},"message":"Yeah its always over crowded that's an issue with Rangoli otherwise the food quality is great ... :-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T18:30:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"592998054084682","from":{"name":"Amber Zulfiqar","id":"649390400"},"message":"Its 1099 per head with unlimited drinks and a game as well","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T18:37:54+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"592998547417966","from":{"name":"Amber Zulfiqar","id":"649390400"},"message":"Agreed..

The experience over all was not too good not too bad. The service was rather slow, we asked ice like a million times for our lemonade and only then they gave us some. \n\nFor 1250 per head I was at least expecting 40+ dishes but alas that was not the case. The basic items for iftar were  beef samosas, vege rolls, channa chat, dhai barey, chicken cheese sandwiches and chicken wings. Channa chat was too spicy, nothing special about beef samosas but the sandwiches were good. There were 3 different types of salads out of which I only tried the macaroni one which I felt had a strong taste of chilli garlic ketchup. Iftar platter gets a 7 out of 10.\n\nThe main course had soup, alferdo pasta, small mushroom and pepper steaks, chicken chilli kind of something, mashed potatoes, drumsticks,  fried fish and I guess one other thing which I am forgetting. I will give an average of 6 out of10 on taste of the main courses. \n\nDessert Bar was the only delight with strawberry cheesecake, chocolate fudge cake, chocolate ?clairs, pineapple cake, chocolate mousse cake and pudding.

I'm here on vacation from abroad so when friends suggested 'Sam's Place' (located above Butlers on Zamzama), i was more than a bit skeptical. I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to food & eateries, & expected to be taken to a dingy little place with an ogling staff & less than mediocre food. There are no pictures because I was hungry & didn't think of it! But the place is very pleasant, even the entrance on the ground floor. The staff was extremely courteous & attentive. After placing the order, we were each given a small canap? plate, & bread baskets with flavored butters; the bread seemed freshly baked. The menu was quite impressive. Since it was post iftar, we didn't order proper meals but decided to split a few things. The salad with caramelized walnuts & balsamic vinaigrette was exactly as it should be. An appetizer with cranberries & gorgonzola wrapped in puff pastry was also delicious. Unfortunately the other dishes were chicken which i find the most unexciting of meats, & so i didn't even bother tasting them. Dessert was a brownie something; again, well-made & tasty, not at all 'fast foodish'. The music could do with a tweak but besides that if Sam's Place maintains food & service standards, they are worth a visit.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-14T20:29:25+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-15T20:18:12+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"502436694","name":"Batool Habib Curmally"},{"id":"500616229","name":"Sama Aman"},{"id":"626070061","name":"Salman Aly"},{"id":"706770021","name":"Fariha Tungekar"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"},{"id":"668110949","name":"Danish Majeed"},{"id":"100002989785243","name":"Mareah M.

This is going to be a long one.\nForty4 for dinner. An attentive Aman, and Ican'tbelievehowyummythefoodwas, add to that the lovely company, and this is one of the bestest starts to the weekend I've had in a loooonnnggg time. \nWe started off with Aman's warm welcome, and he helped immensely with our orders. We ordered the hot pot, prawn gambas, calamari, escargots and another chili-something prawns. The hot pot needed vinegar and chili paste and a touch of soy, and it was hearty, filling and flavorful, with all the different textures and flavors in perfect harmony. I'm not a fan of breaded calamari, and Aman told me that if I didn't like it, he'd serve it on the house. Let's just say he didn't have to serve it on the house. The prawn gambas was as brilliant as everyone who has ever claimed it to be...well..claimed. Escargots for the first time. Mr. Sultan was kind enough to show me how it's done, and can I just say that they might look ajeeb, but ohemgeezer, do they taste naaaiiicccceeee! Would I want to have them again, yes please! Although Ali S and Noman did think the chili prawn thingie and escargots ki servings were smaller than they should've been, I only had one of each, so I didn't mind. Moving on to the mains, I stuck to my true and tried prime beef tenderloin with dark cocoa reduction flavored with tarragon. The sauce has a slightly higher note of bitterness, and the heat factor on the sauce has been upped since the last time I had it, which compliments the bitterness and slight hint of sweetness in the sauce. The meat itself however, was the star of the show. I can only wonder where on God's green Earth did  Aman manage to fine such beautiful cuts of meat from. Medium, uniformly pink through and through, slightly pinker in the center, unbelievably succulent and tender. I haven't had such amazing quality of beef anywhere, except maybe Okra's lamb shank, and that's saying something. Okay? I only wish I'd gotten my main sooner than I did, but it was definitely worth waiting for. Mmmm mmmm! Dessert Aman was kind and generous enough to give us on the house. Churros with chocolate sauce, and a red velvet cake. But it wasn't just any red velvet cake. It was light, airy, creamy, with a smooth, light and not overly-sweet frosting. And who would've thought that fried dough and chocolate sauce would be sooooooooooooooo good? Crispy, warm and coated with powdered sugar on the outside, and light, fluffy and soft from the inside. Add to that the sweet, slightly bitter notes that high quality chocolate is bound to have, I'm shocked at my own self-control for not grabbing the churros and chocolate and yelling, 'Mine! Mine only! I no share!'. 'Twas definitely a perfect end to a very pleasant evening. Once again, thank you to those who came, and I'm so sorry those who couldn't missed out on some great food and great company.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-22T20:24:53+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-25T15:30:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"506455670","name":"Muhammad Jamal"},{"id":"786945014","name":"Samia Chundrigar"},{"id":"547717982","name":"Ali Waqar"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"504810399","name":"Zara Rehman"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NTA2NDU1Njcw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"525227380861750","from":{"name":"Ali Allawala","id":"652674858"},"message":"You've made me feel hungry.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-22T20:27:41+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"525227597528395","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Yeesss!

We had passed by Thai Express (on Shahbaz) many times, so as lovers of Thai cuisine, we figured that it was time to give it a try. \n\nAt first glance, the menu seemed a bit modest, but they did have all the major fish, chicken and beef dishes that one would normally expect at a Thai restaurant. We ordered the prawn toast for starters, which was small but light and extremely tasty. We followed up with a main course of chicken green curry and chicken stir fry with vegetables served with steamed rice. We topped off the meal by sharing an apple crumble for dessert.\n\nI must admit, the food exceeded my expectations. Not only was it authentic and extremely flavorful, unlike some other Thai restaurants, the food wasn?t overly spicy. In fact, I ordered a chili sauce on the side which amped up the flavor tremendously. Dessert could have been better, but did not take away from the overall dining experience. The service was quick and the waiters were attentive and responsive. Ambiance was average, but no complaints. And with the lunch deal, it was great value for money (about Rs. 650 per head).\n\nI highly recommend Thai Express for lovers of exotic food and anyone who is looking for a unique and casual dining experience without the high prices and frills of the fancier restaurants.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-02T16:51:45+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-02T20:14:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"},{"id":"680337728","name":"Abbas Hussain"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQxNTk0MzIwMA\u003d\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"482039385180550","from":{"name":"Sadaf Yacoob","id":"619315634"},"message":"thats a rave review. my experience at Thai Express has always been really bad, and something i'd rather forget than talk about.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-02T17:34:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"482096998508122","from":{"name":"Thai Thai","id":"100004535555147"},"message":"Hi Taimur, thanks for the lovely review.

The quality of the food was excellent. We were given herb butter with garlic bread and my husband absolutely flipped for the butter. He literally wolfed down the bread. \nAppetizer: Because I have a habit of not finishing my food we generally order a salad and share. We had the mixed herb, sun-dried tomato, and mozzarella salad. The mixed Herbs were delicious and the sun-dried tomatoes had a great smoky flavour and was a good starter.\nMains: I decided to go for seafood and decided to try the grilled fish, and the server was kind enough to ensure that the fish would be red snapper and \"smell free\" Oh My God... I LOVED my fish, I asked for the sauce to be given separately so I had an un-adulterated taste of fish, it surpassed my expectations and I actually finished my entire portion. yay. My Husband had chicken with mushrooms and cheese gratin it was on a bed of fettuccine and my husband was very satisfied.\n\nDessert: THE RIDING HOOD CAFE... AMAZING!!!! There is no other word for it.. thats why I wrote their name first:) They have just launched a Belgian Chocolate Cake (today).. My husband was swooning when he ate it! He didn't even share! It was just that good. We spoke to the chief and he told us it is made of compounded chocolate. When you eat it you can tell. They richness and moisture is what you get in quality cakes abroad.  We also had the chocolate cupcakes as well as a red velvet cupcake. We were also given a Complimentary tasting of their baked samosa's. All the treats were of the highest quality and you could tell they were made with love. Both my husband and I have become Riding Hood Addicts after just one visit.

Tried some of the new menu and most of it was quite well received by the gang, especially the Chicken Teriyaki and Snapper. The Singaporean noodles are a good bet for someone who likes spicy food but it was a bit overwhelming for the young lady who I bullied into trying it! The pomegranate juice was also given high marks. I enjoyed the papaya salad and bbq wings too. Desserts were pretty close to the old menu and who can go wrong with molten lava cake & creme brulee!! \n\nHowever, since this was truly the first night for the new menu, and we polluted it with personal choices, we will have to give the full new menu a run when it is ready and that review will be more robust than this one. Always feels good to eat at a place where the staff is eager to please and for us, that was CBG again. Missed Ali Raj today and hope all is well with his family. Thank you Hussain for all the cooperation, attention to detial and care because I know its not just us who gets it!! For all those reasons, CBG remains one of our favourite places to spend an evening out with friends.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-19T17:07:23+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-19T19:26:51+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"624278367","name":"Anju Ahmed"},{"id":"515001060","name":"Mehvish M.

Pretty decent. The variety for iftar was good, and tasted nice too. Actually, someone like me could have had a complete meal from what was on offer from iftar buffet! :) There were 4 of us, so we ordered 4 different dishes from the main course option. I had rosemary infused beef, and liked it. The seafood teriyaki platter (i think that was it) was ok. Wouldn't recommend it! Thai green curry was also not bad, but nothing for which i'd rush back. Fuschia is much better for that. Desserts need to be worked upon. Overall, it was a nice experience. Another great thing about the place was that there is a gent's prayer area just walking distance from the restuarant.

In awe of your superb lunch deals that we tried today, and sad because we did not try them earlier!! \n\nThe three course lunch deals with mocktails at Rs 644 + tax are actually too good to be true. Although I wanted to sample some of the strongly SWOT-recommended entrees, one glance at the deals, and I decided we were all going for them. And am I glad that we did! \n\nNot only was the food scrumptious to the core, the portions were more than ample. (we were quite skeptical about the portion sizes.) I took the Seafood deal and Irfan opted for the Beef deal while our daughters shared the Pasta deal. \n\nSo here's what came to our table: \nStarters: \n  Hot & Sour Soup: tangy, fragrant and flavourful. Loved it!\n  Som Tam (papaya salad): fresh, crunchy and fiery. just as I like it!\n  Chilli Honey Glazed Wings: the quantity (five wings) was impressive, taste was a little ketchup-y but it fared well with the girls. \n\nEntrees:\n   Wok Fried Beef with basil chilli oyster sauce served with steamed rice: Verrry generous portion, scrumptious, a tad bit less flavourful than Fuchsia's. \n   Tamarind Chilli Fish with Basil served with rice: Thank God for the separately served tamarind sauce!! The lightly battered fish was very crisp and did not turn soggy as it usually does after being doused with the sauce. \n   Fettuccine Alfredo: Looked awesome. and the girls polished it off! \n\nDesserts:\n   Bread & butter pudding with ice cream: ohmygodthatwastoogood!! I am definitely going to be dreaming about it for days to come!\n   Chocolate Molten Lava Cake served with ice cream: The chocolate was not strong enough, although the cake was very moist. Ice cream was awfully crystallized. \n\nDrinks:\n   Pina Colada, Lemon Margarita, and Fresh Lime with 7-up: All good!\n\nNeedless to say, we were stuffed beyond imagination! The place is lovely and very pleasant. The seating is highly comfortable. The outdoor patio is such a romantic spot. :)\nThe servers were very courteous and prompt. However, somehow our server was not knowledgeable enough about the lunch deals. He missed our drinks totally and was kind of puzzled when we asked about them. So the drinks arrived after we were done with our main course. But this was the only hiccup in our otherwise absolutely fantastic dining experience. Forty4, see you again soon!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-20T13:39:18+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-23T04:46:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"620145354","name":"Bina Saeed"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"711699788","name":"Sanaa Zubairi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzExNjk5Nzg4","before":"NzA4MDI1NDkx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"414907181893771","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100003681493822"},"message":"wow.....the deal seems great value for money..i guess ill wait to wait for the lunch deal now after ramdhan:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-20T15:04:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"414914748559681","from":{"name":"Saira Malik","id":"1133719630"},"message":"Yes reshma.. it indeed was great value for money.

If one phrase were to sum up our evening, it would be that the attentive and seamless service of the evening surpassed their great food. I have to say, the management of Aylanto deserve 'shaabaashi' for how they have come around in regards to their service, timing, attentiveness and in being accommodating. \n \nNow about the food- goats cheese and broccoli soup, chilli prawns, and crab gratin got the festivities underway. The soup and the gratin were great- love their fine-dining interpretation of two ultimate confort foods- potato gratin and broccoli cheddar soup. However, the chilli prawns were a little overpowerring- they were not just spicy, but seemed to have been treated with a sort of garlic 'tharka', making them a bit oily and taking away from the flavor of the red chillis.\n \nOur entrees were lobster ravioli, served with a nicely balanced white sauce and cherry tomatos, which made each bite fresh as well as bringing out the sweetness of the lobster. However, we wished that the ravioli were boiled in water that was perhaps more salty. The second entree was the favorite steak chanterelle- cooked and rested to our preferences, but again, a little low in the seasoning.  Seems like the salt-police has chefs and kitchen staff everywhere holding back lately!!\n \nDesserts were to be had, though were were stuffed! The white chocolate cheesecake with bramble/ blackberry compote and tiramasu were divinely light as they were both creamy, cheesy, and sweet! I just wish that they had put a candle on the cake, as I had asked at the time of making reservations, but I guess it was alright, considering the indoor section of the restaurant was a little warm... but overall, a good evening, perhaps a sign of the wonderful year that lies ahead for the both of us!

Must say not a single complaint from anyone in our group of finicky eaters. Everything seemed up to par and the lemon chicken was divine! Sad to see the departure of the beef with kale since a few months though. If you haven't had their chocolate mousse btw, you're all missing out. Sajjad and his team of servers were super efficient and helpful as always. I guess we've just been very lucky since we eat there VERY regularly and have yet to have come across a bad food day.

Since it was a buffet, let me go over the items one by one:\n\n1. The spicy pasta salad - 10/10 Full of flavor and zest. \n2. Chicken Biryani - 10/10 Again, scrumptious with the just the perfect amount of oil and spice. Just the way I like it.\n3. White Qorma - 5/10 Nothing to write home about. It was \"Shan-masala\" made.\n4. Daal - Didn't try\n5. Mix Sabzi - 10/10 Brilliant.\n6. Chicken Khara Masala - 5/10 Bland.\n7.Creamy Pasta - 3/10 Kept this for the last. Couldn't eat more than one bite. Too much methi or something, wasn't creamy or cheesy. Totally tasteless.\n8. Fried fish - 10/10 Delish!\n9. The soup - I don't know what soup it was but it wasn't good.\n\nFor Desserts:\n\n1. The caramel biscuit was my winner tonight. Soft and crumbly with a yummy biscuit base, it was just divine.\n2. Great caramel pudding....but then haven't seen ANYONE messing that up :)\n3. Chocolate pastry was nice. But a little dry.\n4. Mom loved the shahi tukra, the rasberry shortcake and the trifle.\n5. The blueberry cheesecake was awesome.\n6. Chocolate souffl?' - nice and airy\n\nOverall, a great time at the place but having said that, it didn't match up to the high KFC gave me yesterday :D LOL!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-27T19:52:39+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-27T20:14:13+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002374917039","name":"Syeda Areeba"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"643405172","name":"Sarah Ashraf"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI1OTY4OTUz","before":"MTAwMDAyMzc0OTE3MDM5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"387319667985856","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"yes the fish is delicious!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-27T20:14:13+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzg3MzE5NjY3OTg1ODU2","before":"Mzg3MzE5NjY3OTg1ODU2"}}},"restaurantName":"Dessert"},{"id":"165861103465048_385503721500784","from":{"name":"Shaikh Fawad","id":"694238742"},"message":"MUNIZA was craving pizza all day, so naturally we ordered inn Pizzo at Abid Aziz Merchant's place: \nAppetizer:\nDecent quality chicken strips, slightly over cooked \u003cbit rubbery for my taste\u003e but gud \u003cpanko\u003e breading w/ a respectable honey mustard sauce.\nNice soggy buffalo chicken wings, succulent & tangy : )\nPizza?s:\n12?

Arrived right behind the car of Hussain Tariq's small tiny cafe. The valet was at his car door, but instead he came to me. That is customer service. Inside, the tiny place was packed to the brim. I think a single khajoor table was free. \nWe took the five course deal, 1290 a head.\n\nCustom baked lasagne for my daughter. The two waiters were stressed to the max. So I knew everything would be slowish. The fondant fountain was a great idea. My kids and all the others really enjoyed it. very good idea. People were being turned away.\n\nFood was quite good. Fried Calamari was very good, the tarragon infused vinegar cole slaw was very nice. The soup was acceptable, The portion sizes and pricing points just show that Blue Ginger is great value for money. The Ceasar needs an overhaul, no anchovies to speak of. The seafood rissotto....brilliance, delicate perfectly cooked carnoli rice, amazingly fresh and tender seafood. Bloody awesome dish.\n\nThe bad. Sadly, the creme brulee was awful, greasy smoky and not acceptable. The cheese cake was very nice, didn't need the coulis or apple slices, a small slice of well made cake in a small plate is far better than a serving platter with decorations. One AC leaked like Niagra falls. Small issues for a great place. if you get one thing out of this, The deal was great value for money, I now realize there are signature dishes, I just have to find them.

Didn't know Olivetto also did a buffet type dinner.  Was really impressed.  The Lounge portion of Olivetto was reserved for the GT.  Choice of chicken cream and tomato soups followed by 3 starters (margarita pizza slices, cheese on crackers with olives and spicy prawns on toast) were passed around.  The buffet was awesome, mediterranean salad (amazing with sun dried tomatoes, feta cheese, olives), hummour in Mediterranean sauce, fillet of beef in pepper sauce, penne al arabiatta, prawn risotto, chicken in creamy mushroom sauce and Mediterranean rice. All the main courses were really delicious.  Desserts included cream caramel, italian bread pudding and vanilla ice cream. Olivetto did a great job.  It was one helluva buffet dinner.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-20T19:48:14+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-21T05:56:02+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"500293260","name":"Aamir Basrai"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1039048992","name":"Camilla Asmatullah"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"1442271682","name":"Sajida Ali"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"},{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Nzc3NjQ3ODAy","before":"MTAwMDAyNjY4OTYxNDAz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"281285578589266","from":{"name":"ArtScene Galleries","id":"1463201564"},"message":"loved d food..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T19:50:09+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281287281922429","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"Great selection of menu, feeling hungry at this time after reading.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T19:53:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281288708588953","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"FF, maybe u can go to Olivetto and check out any leftovers.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T19:54:24+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281289541922203","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"AAM I don't expect leftover as Shahzad Artscene was also there ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T19:55:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281291298588694","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"The food was so yummy Farhan that Olivetto beats any Karachi eatery hands down.

Ordered the starter of the Charcoal Platter consisting of fried chicken slices with cheese, fish fingers, chicken wings & deep fried button mushrooms served with 4 dippers. That plate was emptied within mintues by 3 adults & 3 kids - verdict - yummy n felt like ordering more!\n\nMain courses:\n\n1) Mushroom Steak with mashed potatoes - It was beef, juicy and well done, served withg fantastic taste of mashied potatoes.\n\n2) Fish & Chip - 2 slices of fish fillets served with salad and fries. Quite a serving that my mom still had 1 sliced left coz she was too full. Served with tartar sauce and a dipper for the fries which was really crispy.\n\n3) Charcoal Mix Platter - enough for 2 - Grilled prawns wz sliced capsicum, small slice of lemon and onion - a lil spicy but not desi :) Steak with sauce, again juicy n yummy. Fish fillet - crispy on the outside but soft in the inside, chicken piece with white sauce - no complain and lastly their awesome mashed potatoes!\n\n4) Popcorn Chicken with fries (kiddy meal) - Big popcorn chicken deep fried just nice, crispy and juice and yummy fries that was served with it with the dipper. Had to order another one coz the elder son didnt want to share! :)\n\nDesserts -\n\n1) Brownie - Big chunk of brownie served in a tall glass, surrounded with yummy ice cream vanilla ice cream, huge portion, can be shared.\n\n2) Chocolate Mousse - smooth and chocolatey at the right amount.\n\n3) Cheesecake with caramel - Delish and with the caramel on top it added just the right amount of sweetness to it,just perfect to end our evening by the sea.\n\nGreat service, ambiance and definitely worth a visit. Will put up some photos soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-17T04:19:31+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-17T04:51:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"610590030","name":"Najam Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjEwNTkwMDMw","before":"MTA5ODQwOTE3MQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"279249205459570","from":{"name":"Mohsin E Azam","id":"622525326"},"message":"I second that...

It's up to us to make the working environment attractive enough that staff thinks twice about leaving.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-11-30T04:47:14+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"644738761","name":"Tina Mehdi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":10},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq","type":"user","offset":99,"length":13}]},{"id":"269006303150527","from":{"name":"Abdullah Ahmed Muhammad","id":"571594364"},"message":"Is it open for lunch?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-11-30T06:13:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"269019763149181","from":{"name":"De Joe","id":"597535350"},"message":"tina, i fear we're swimming against the tide.... this seems to have become the norm. however, i concur with nez, thought the chef was Malaysian.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-11-30T07:21:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"269025609815263","from":{"name":"Sarmad Shahbaz Bughio","id":"522436392"},"message":"it says 3 cooks.
