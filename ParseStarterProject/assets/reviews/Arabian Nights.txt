I asked for Faisal who normally serves us and serves us well but was informed he is busy and can't serve you, \"us kay paas time nahee heay\" the other server said, shocking. After thirty minutes my order was taken verbally and took another half in hour for my order to be completed as it was served in bits and pieces, Tea first then food later one dish came after ten-fifteen minutes after the whole order was completed. Their was a supervisor in white shalwar kameez but he seemed oblivious to the situation. We were served by three different servers and the last one seemed deaf and mute because he never responded to my request, the precious one admitted they were short of staff when I complained. Finally a bill was scribbled and shown to me on the back of a brown envelope but I asked for a proper bill that took 20 more minutes, the whole process of ordering, serving and billing should not take an hour here it took double of that time because no one bothered to come and ask us if we needed anything. In conclusion as a old and regular customer of Damascus I would like to ask the management of damascus, who I am aware is active on this group, HOW do u expect it is physically possible for 3-4 servers to serve more than a 100 ppl?? They cover both gents and family section, you desperately need to hire more staff and train them better. I have had great Arabic food, Khava, green etc from Damascus and the service was excellent a few years ago, but now sadly service standards have fallen immensely, to catch the attention of a server its takes 30 min, to get your order it takes as much time and their is soo much confusion the servers are running around helter/skelter but not able to take your order, finally you bill take 20-25, good god, damascus was a sheer joy in the yester years but today it was a sheer torture, after today I can never go again, I rather go to the place opposite which cares and respects its paying customers and provides good service not such a painful experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-26T21:46:14+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-30T07:47:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100004229319190","name":"Sidra Saboor"},{"id":"654805071","name":"Rifa Di"},{"id":"501970131","name":"Waris Shaikh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAxOTcwMTMx","before":"MTAwMDA0MjI5MzE5MTkw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"640190982698722","from":{"name":"Najia Ahmed","id":"819424477"},"message":"I am a daily visitor at Damascus .

As you have stated, we are experiencing a severe shortage of waiting staff, and hiring just about anyone would only make matters worse. It is not about cost of employing more waiters or recoveries, only a matter of finding honest workers who won't embarrass a restaurant in worse ways than delayed orders (other food businesses will agree & can somewhat imagine the possibilities/their capabilities). We are in the process of looking for and training new waiters as we speak and will be back to how we were before the week is over, everyone's 'like-home' place.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-28T10:31:54+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"521908454","name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","type":"user","offset":0,"length":17}]},{"id":"641150935936060","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Asad Aly Dhanani:-Thank you for your delayed response, i am surprised how casually you have brushed the complaint under the mat.No apologies what so ever caused to an old and valued patron of damascus.If you had really bothered to read my post and read between the lines i had stated that the staff including the line supervisor was oblivious to walk in customers, either they were pretending to be busy or simply not bothered, I happen to visit hundreds of eating places all over and again would stress upon the fact that training and HRM is the most important essence in running a business.If you invest in good, honest, hard working HR they will be the key to you're success, but if you don't feel customer is king and you can run a business just on the basis of good will that's a far cry in this day and age, waiters should have a pen and paper while taking the order and revisit the customers the tables a few times to inquire if anything else if required. The only one who regularly came around was the sheesha wala to replace the coal. I would not dwell on this aspect if I didn't feel damascus has potential and its one of my favorites, my service is the key and one Faisal cant serve the whole crowd of customers.

The ambiance was good as ever however the food was a major let down. First the positives, the humus and flafel are one of the best in town and my friends loved it more than BBQ tonights hummus. The main course however was Spicy Cheese Broast, Double Beef Burger Delight, Chicken Delux Burger and drinks. It was a big let down to see the fries (all of them) literally overcooked and dripping with oil, the broast was a sorry state of oil on top. The beef burger was an absolute delight to eat however the remaining food quality was very poor. I got embarrased infront of my friends as I had suggested the place to them. Price is not an issue, quality of food is. I know they are better known for their BBQ items but still whats on the menu should be of good standard.

The place is better organized, visited the new lounge but the ac's were out of order and secondly they offered a different menu from the arabic one inside so consensus was to sit outdoors. We sat in comfortable khema (tent) with farshi seating, cushions and an effective fan. Ordered Furrouge grill Full, Special Shahwarma platter, Chicken Shahwarma, Hummus n Peeta bread, waiters were sparse and shaky, seemed confused and in a hurry, asked three times what we wanted, were told order will take 15-20 atleast, after half and hour i inquired, they said another 10 min, again asked, they said ten minutes, food arrived after nearly an hour, was totally famished, has to reprimand the supervisor Javed who was most apologetic, the food was very very good or we were very hungry, but the servers were not in control. One guy said \"sir aaj rush bhuth heay\" the other guy said that they are understaffed etc. If only these people can improve their level of service a bit the food and the environment is different and very nice n relaxing to spend an evening.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-09T21:00:44+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-11T12:37:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"410974015620421","from":{"name":"Umtus Sanna Hussain-Mirza","id":"528525436"},"message":"i went there once too and they took an hour to serve us!no jokes!never went back again!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-09T21:32:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"411556628895493","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"I was pleasantly suprised to receive a reply from Arabian Nights which is reproduced as follows:- Mr.Azam First we would like to say thanks to you for your appreciation and secondly for your feed back ...we understand your inconvenient, and we appologise for that .Arabian Nights is constantly working to improve the service and quality we take your feedback positively and we assure you we will take action on it and prove you with best service and quality in the future.\nPlease always share your feedback with us it will help us to serve you better.\nThanks","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-11T12:34:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"411557665562056","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Kudos to Arabian Nights, if you seriously work on your HRM you have a fine place.

But the idea of that lounge seem confusing, humm so talking to the owner when i asked him why lounge!!! he said 'fine dining?!!! OK 'fine dining? and ?lounge?? does not click really. He says they will serve authentic arabic as well as continental food e.g those ?mandi? would be served on china plate, but that takes away the authenticity of plating it. That lounge has two floors ground floor ?fine dining?  and the top floor more like lounge with LCD and live music. The menu is completely new, opening from today. I will lunch/dine sometime this week and then do the full review.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-21T03:19:03+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-21T05:38:23+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"383286571722499","from":{"name":"Rumana Husain","id":"1081674067"},"message":"Farah where is this?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-21T05:05:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"383287768389046","from":{"name":"Junaid Zuberi","id":"643423090"},"message":"Yes wheres this place?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-21T05:09:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"383295405054949","from":{"name":"Farah S.
