They were sweet enough to give us an amuse-bouche (I got excited cause I remembered when Chandler from friends tried it) of beef with rocket and something else that tasted like chicken.. their bread basket was so good i think we slightly filled up on it a bit much- cause the garlic butter served with it went so well with it..For starters we had chicken money bags. quite the cute these fried dumplings were, beause they were actually shaped like money bags out of a cartoon heist.. for which they gave with an assortment of sauces to go with, one was spicy, one was garlicy and the other a sweet hoison sauce.. i reallyreally loved my steak with chardonnay sauce. Whoever cooked it knew exactly how to get a medium-rare just perfect. It came with not one but TWO sides.. I chose potatoe zuchini gratin and potatoe wedges... I'm a sucker for gratin and this is the best ive tasted so far... and The blackened honeyed hoison beef tenderloin tasted like what I hear is the next best thing to General Tsao's chicken... which is what we were kind of hoping for. Only thing was it wouldve been better on rice rather than rice noodles. Overall it was like eating out of Masterchef kitchen- so much YUM! \n\nAlso, and I cannot stress this enough- they played the perfect music. instrumental up-beat jazz. Its good enough to enjoy as background music, and not distracting enough to pull away from the conversation.

Mc Donalds, Hardees and imported fries are industrious products and have their peculiar tastes that we are all hooked to. (I have a MD session at least once every 10 days). But the taste of a fresh burger and fries is a different ball game and can not be compared. Personal likings aside someone like you who knows his food, this is a little hard for me to digest. Would love to be educated and would also invite you to try the fires at Loginn (I will personally do them for you) without a bias and may be I get convinced. In consistency is an issue but it cannot be generalized.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-07T16:28:35+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail","type":"user","offset":0,"length":12}]},{"id":"273426766041814","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Najmi Saheb: it would be a pleasure to come and try out the fries at Loginn and an even bigger one to try something that you make. Over the years, and please feel free to correct me if I am wrong, I feel that fries made fresh seem to sometimes turn out a little sweet, maybe owing to the quality of potatoes or otherwise. I have noticed this in fries made in my home also. This is, ofcourse, a personal opinion and I am sure there are many exceptions to this, such as yourself. Also, the imported fries are an indulgence for me and I quite enjoy the personal decadence. But, in all fairness, I will also add that I love good food but I can't cook / fry / boil anything myself so maybe its a technical thing. As far as any fresh food goes, nothing out of a packet or a box can compare to it so I will agree with you wholeheartedly on your view. And I respect it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-07T16:58:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"273434109374413","from":{"name":"Zarnak Sidhwa","id":"777488661"},"message":"i like the one at the Deli","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-07T17:12:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"273441669373657","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"Irfan Ismail inconsistency is an issue,during the off season potatoes here are kept in Cold storage unprocessed, that is when they turn sweet and taste awful,  while in the initial days it can be handled with additives but the longer they stay in the harder it becomes to handle, luckily for the past two years red potatoes from Quetta have started to come in which are diff from the Punjab reds, they are hard and with care come out good.
