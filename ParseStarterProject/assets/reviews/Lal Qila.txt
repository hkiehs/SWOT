In 1800 rupees all 6 of us had so much food and then there was enough left for one more person..\n\nHighlight of the food were prawns and batair.. one of the chicken dish was like chicken paneer handi it was excellent too..\n\nOverall taste wise it was a 7/10 but if you need something fast i really mean FAST its 10/10.. \n\nTip: We felt its better to get the take away than eating over there..

Had some squash juices and milk roohafza on the table prior Iftar, the iftar menu was fine, later when it came to the mains that is when i started regretting LQ. The food variety was not big and it lacked quality and taste, opted for tempura prawns and there it lied a small prawn in the big oily crispy coating. Then went for some BBQ. It was so so, then found something with a name tag of Shahzada Salim Khas.. on my curiosity i took a bit and there it was Pasta Alfredo. Seriously did the mughals had Pastas at that time LOL. That is some serious Epic Joke. Out of all those dishes around this was re-named. Went on to Fish Tikka, too much salt in it with no such flavors. The chinese almost ended. Then tried Sajji, it did some justice compared to other food. It was later I shifted to Deserts and had some bit of various sweets. The Shahi Tukra had nothing Shahi in them !! The labe shereen was fine others were upto LQ expectations !! The food was seriously low quality and taste, with attentive service. Rs 1250/- per head exclusive drinks. Seriously it does not in any way does justice. Went to Kolachi a week ago and i Must say it was worth every penny. I would give LQ 2/10.

Everything was good, yes good not poor neither exceptional. When it comes to buffet dinner the names Lal Qila, Al Boston and Village arises in your mind and if you compare them with mirage then sorry to say mirage will loose when compared to taste and especially the variety of foods. When asked from the manager that how come they don't have ice cream or at least kulfa I was replied with the answer that they are not good for the throat in winter. However the best thing about mirage is its sea view and peaceful dining experience, too bad I was accompanied with a wife and two toddlers, otherwise it would had been a great venue if I was on a date, what can be more romantic then a beautiful girl in front and the calm blue sea on the left, so I have made up my mind to go their again with my wife when my kids have grown enough to be home alone. Now according to Swots rule you are only allowed to express about the food to make sure that ones opinion does not effect the whole and I fully accept that so in the end I would only say that the gravity of food flavor greatly depends upon the environment and company you are carrying with you and I'm quite sure that many of you will enjoy their dinning experience more than I had.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-09T05:24:38+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-09T08:29:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3Mjg3Mzkz","before":"NTE3Mjg3Mzkz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"470277369690085","from":{"name":"Zubair Uddin","id":"704566421"},"message":"not good for throat....lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-09T08:29:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDcwMjc3MzY5NjkwMDg1","before":"NDcwMjc3MzY5NjkwMDg1"}}},"restaurantName":"Lal Qila"},{"id":"165861103465048_424216414296181","from":{"name":"Zubair Uddin","id":"704566421"},"message":"Kolachi: Mismanagement Galore.\n\nFirst, they messed up our reservation, in spite of personally going there and calling twice.\n\nWe were seated upstairs on the deck and it was very difficult accessing the far away buffet downstairs, especially with the children.\n\nThe drinks were quite diluted and they hid the lassi.
