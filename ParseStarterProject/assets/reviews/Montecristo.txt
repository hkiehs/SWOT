An ordinary one but less ordinary. more special in a way that it was filling.\n\nBacon Peperroni Jalapeno Pizza, 6/10 but upto the mark. maybe change the cheese topping. loved the crust though. fresh and crispy, this was a thin pan. \n\nTeriyaki Chicken, 5/10. big no from us. i think everyone just cannot do teriyaki. \n\nChicken Scallaponi, 8/10 this was my order. i dont remember much about this one, since i was busy tasting the others but i do remember that next time i goto monte cristo, i have to order one of these again.\n\nthe highlight of the night was the beef fillet, after such a long time, someone understood what medium rare is, and it was cooked to perfection. i was so happy to see it, that i forgot everything on the table. i found this to be so heavenly, i was almost envious why i did not order the fillet. Mushroom Sauce, impeccable. 9.5/10. perfectly seasoned, grilled, butter fried oh i want to have it right now !\n\nThanks Montecristo, i think we will become good friends. \n\nHaris Shaikh","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-25T06:30:55+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-26T11:26:29+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100006409002964","name":"Sirfraz Ali"},{"id":"530060365","name":"Abdul Wajid Qureshi"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"505552596","name":"Rabiya Anjum"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"558178102","name":"Safoora Fahad"},{"id":"569219957","name":"Naveed Ashraf"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"517470504","name":"Nida Ali"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"100003698171140","name":"Asra Mushtaq"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"642953122","name":"Amer Zahid"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"571357266","name":"Khurram Zameer"},{"id":"100001651622767","name":"Fatima Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNjUxNjIyNzY3","before":"MTAwMDA2NDA5MDAyOTY0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"624086504309170","from":{"name":"Umair Hassan","id":"755585401"},"message":"Fahad Farooq shayan ko dekha do yeh :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T07:36:50+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"577115473","name":"Fahad Farooq","type":"user","offset":0,"length":12}]},{"id":"624191927631961","from":{"name":"Sidra Khatri","id":"514359736"},"message":"lol we also went to Montecristo when we found Olivetto closed and recommended to many friends who also loved it... looks like Olivetto is giving away customers to Montecristo :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T13:32:22+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624214927629661","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"olivetto is closed on tuesdays","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T14:40:25+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624244844293336","from":{"name":"Anwer Jamal Chandna","id":"1424317236"},"message":"Haris Shaikh if you could pls name the items in the pictures for better understanding...though liked yr detailed review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T15:42:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624245077626646","from":{"name":"Haris Shaikh","id":"694723124"},"message":"Ok.
