It was a successful event and we had a great time meeting new people :)  \n\nFirstly last night was one of the coldest nights by far and I thought we were going to turn into popsicles but thanks to the  management at Sajjad that didn't happen. It was unusually and surprisingly warm. Its covered from all sides and has fires burning at different spots which is really nice. So this answers the question for all who have been seeking a warm spot at do darya.\n\nNow to the FOOD.\nStarters: Chicken Dhakka, Hot and Sour Soup, BBQ prawns, lemon chicken and fish dhakka.\n\nMains: Afghani Boti, Chicken karhai, Shahi Handi.\n\nSTARTERS:\n? Chicken Dhakka: \n The most loved starter off all time I assume. It had been wiped clean off the dish as soon as it hit the table. Boneless chicken fried in a delicious batter served with this amazing sauce. Hands down the best dish on the menu and a must must try.\n\n?Hot & Sour Soup:\nDefiantly has room for improvement. But since we were sitting in a Pakistani themed Resturant i didn't expect a tiny Chinese man dancing out of my soup. So all good.\n\n?BBQ Prawns: \nOk i am not a seafood person at all. So according to the people who ate them they did enjoy. Its a very interesting dish. Plain simple flavours which enhanced the taste of the prawns \n\n?Lemon Chicken:\nAnother of my favorites. YUM i felt like im in chicken heaven. Crunchy chicken fried perfectly packed with that lemon zing. At the same time it didnt over power the chicken.\nI would keep going back for that.\n\n?Fish Dhaka:\nAnother one of the yummi delights. Me not being a sea food person fell for them like i slipped on a banana peel. \nMust try again. A complete winter dish\n\nMAINS:\nWe had stuffed our selfs with the starters lol\n\n?Chicken Karhai:\nJust has a taste but now i know why are they famous for it. Tasted yum.\n\n?Afghani Beef Boti:\nI can keep returning for that every single day. Soft, filled with taste, melts in the mouth. Neither to spicy neither bland just the right amount of spices.\n\n?Shahi Chicken Handi:\nA shahi handi for a shahi gathering lol. \nI love it.

Rs. 1100/head (INCLUSIVE of softdrinks, tax and a healthy TIP so please don't whine :p but c'mon be generous and perceive it the 'buffet' way)\nPhotos (just incase u dont find the post): https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set\u003doa.665065696877917&type\u003d1\n\nService, Cleanliness, Set up, ambiance, preparation to deal with buffet and crowd 10/10\nVariety 8+1 for the desserts bar so 9 (its a restaurant not lal qila or mirage to make u go crazy by serving everything they probably make:p)\n\nLets Hakka-ofy about the FOOOOOOOD :D :D :D\n\nHot n Sour White soup: It was really nice with pleasant flavors, but i found it a 'Halka haath on the mirchi' so I m totally a hot n sour red person and thats what i like there\n\nPrawn Balls: They were cold so i can't say much about the taste. Upon complaining, the manager informed that they will be beginning live frying outdoors in the patio to have fresh food.\n\nPrawn Toast: Ainween nai i reccommend them *Nom Nom Nom* sorry Ayesha I got the garma garam ones:p\n\nChicken Manchurian: Must have been better if their was more gravy to it, so it was semi liquidy but taste wise it was pleasant, not spicy but moist and well done chicken\n\nBeef in Oyster Sauce: Full flavor parade!

From the appetizers we ordered chilli garlic prawns and from the main course we ordered two Zesty Red Snappers and the Baked Fish ala Roma. The food was, by and large, bland. I can understand that the fish ala roma would be so because it specified that it would be cooked in garlic and butter with olives, but what happened to the zest in the red snapper? Another disappointment was the absence of sidelines with the fish ala roma ? no saut?ed vegetables, no potato, just sadness :( Compared to the snapper, this dish looked like a Kids Meal. What?s interesting, though, is that the presentation was impressive: they brought it in a big dish with a huge foiled bag on top. However, once you open that it?s a complete anti-climax because the fish looked tiny. My sincere suggestion would be to eliminate this sort of presentation because, really, why would you want your customers to have such a reaction? The prices have increased over the past couple of months, we felt, because majority of the dishes were over 1k. Now, if I?m paying Rs. 1200, on average, for a dish it should be *Aussie accent* a CRACKIN? dish! These were not. We also ordered the chocolate cake for dessert, which was the saving grace of the entire meal because it really hit the sweet spot ? just the right sort of chewy texture which, when broken into, oozes out delicious and warm chocolate and they served it with ice cream.  I suppose we would have been able to digest the earlier disappointment because of dessert but that disappeared within seconds after receiving the bill ? Rs. 8500 *BANG* So beware, if you?re thinking of going to HLS, do keep a wad of cash or it?ll be an embarrassing situation. Now, I?m not sure if it was because of the bill or the fish, but I got back home extremely nauseous and woozy. I didn?t throw up though, but I crashed pretty bad and had horrific dreams. No more Ala-Roma-Anything for me!\n\nAnyway, I just got back from Xanders where we ordered:\n- French Toast (all day breakfast, hell yes!)\n- Mini Burgers (Absolutely adorable looking; cant comment on the taste since I didn?t try)\n- Pepperoni Pizza \n- A side of fries (always!)\n- Open chicken sandwich \n- Calamari\n- Parmesan Chicken (ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!!)\n- A large bottle of water, iced tea, coke\n- A slice of chocolate cake\n\nThe bill came to Rs. 4098. \n\nYes *GASP* it?s true! So turns out, that 15 minute is really worth it after all! Friday, however, will take me a while to recover from.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-07T18:36:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-09T06:30:44+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"3432614","name":"Shahfar Khan"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"100005879858955","name":"Hamayun Nisar"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"100003784320529","name":"Shahzad Saeed"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"682502588","name":"Mahin Khalid Siddiqui"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"573091981","name":"Hasan Masood Jafri"},{"id":"548651350","name":"Faizan Abbas"},{"id":"703321080","name":"Hafsah Naeem Ali"},{"id":"785615314","name":"Maleeha Jawaid"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5MjA0NTUy","before":"MzQzMjYxNA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"663242147060272","from":{"name":"Irfan Ali Siddiki","id":"703368408"},"message":"when it first opened, it was all pom pom, some of the operational operators were skeptical, the financials couldn't  justify; I was there initially but reading your post I think the brunt has hit them now, so smaller servings and savings on the taste serums, someone posted about the misbehave for the party booked as well.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-07T20:16:31+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"663243933726760","from":{"name":"Mohsin Arsalan","id":"554541726"},"message":"I had Chae and pappay for breakfast and studied throughout the day.

For some reason all AC's were not working which even made it worse to sit and have food.\n\nOverall a bad experience, I really wont recommend going there and wasting their time, money there.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-07T18:56:26+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"663646983686455","from":{"name":"Talha Hassan","id":"816125622"},"message":"Amal Anis Makda would like you to read my comment.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-08T16:23:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"542900496","name":"Amal Anis Makda","type":"user","offset":0,"length":15}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjYzNjQ2OTgzNjg2NDU1","before":"NjYyNzY5NzAwNDQwODUw"}}},"restaurantName":"Fish"},{"id":"165861103465048_659549657429521","from":{"name":"Saher Fakhar","id":"1564681094"},"message":"Good places for desi style fried fish...any leads?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-30T11:28:35+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-02T22:59:30+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODA3Njc1Njk2","before":"ODA3Njc1Njk2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"659561277428359","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"There is a place near newtown that gets a huge crowd never tried it though","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-30T12:11:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"659561767428310","from":{"name":"Yasir Billoo","id":"807675696"},"message":"Frid fish?

So, for 3 people, we ordered the following:\n\n* Chicken Corn Soup (I know, not many people order the classic Chicken Corn Soup, neither do we, but mother just insisted) - We ordered the large serving of the soup, and it was exactly 3 bowls of soup. No more, no less. Yes it was stated already in the menu that it serves 2-3 people, but the Ginsoy - Extreme Chinese fan in us thought there'd be more. Not at all a disappointment though, by any means. It was exactly what Chicken Corn Soup needs to be. Small little bits, but sufficient, of chicken, adequate amount of corn. The soup was just what it was supposed to be.\n\n* Wasabi Prawns for appetizers - The prawns were remarkably done. They had that wasabi-kick in them which was needed to give that \"buzz\" feel you want to have when eating a Wasabi Prawn. Yet again, there were 5 prawns in total, dot. Tastewise: Brilliant.\n\n* Fish Milano (my main) - Their Fish Milano was intended to be  a large fried fillet of fish placed delicately over a bed of green-herbs sauce and coated with cheese served with rice (as understood from the menu). It was exactly as described. I needed something cheesy and rich, and it definitely delivered. The fish was nicely done; flaky, properly fried, the type that just wants you to keep eating it. The green sauce under the fish was generous in quantity, but didn't quite have much of a \"burst of flavors\" that I was hoping for. But the cheese on top took care of that. All in all, a 7/10\n\n* Fish with Jalapeno *something*, mum's main (apologies for not remembering the complete name) - A similar sized fish to mine, fried as nicely as mine was, sat on the plate with sauteed vegetables, a serving of rice, and a small little bowl/cup containing the sauce for this dish. This sauce however, did have a distinctive taste to it. I actually borrowed some of it to use on my fish as well. The one thing common in the 2 mains was that the steamed rice that were served with them were simply the best ever steamed rice I've ever had in my life. The rice had an amazing feel to them in the mouth that is probably inexplicable, yet noticeable. An 7.5/10\n\n* Black Pepper Chicken and Garlic Rice, sold separately (father's main) - Hands down, the highlight of the day. Never have I tasted Black Pepper Chicken done so beautifully crafted in terms of flavor. And the Garlic Rice were \"actually\" Garlic Rice, not a joke in the name of garlic. You could just bring the bowl of rice close to your nostrils and know for a fact how nicely the garlic was incorporated in the rice. Father won, simple. Would definitely give 8.5/10\n\nWe ordered 3 drinks to go with the meal: Mint Julep, Blue Margarita, Peach *something*. In terms of the quantity of the drinks, father (Mint Julep) won again. Then mum (Peach *something) and then me. Again.\nThe experience, in terms of cozy sitting, soothing music being played in the background (rather than some pop/rap/hip-hop artist blaring) and most importantly, taste, was great. Definitely a place I'd go over and over again.\nThe only problem that I have is that the portions could be slightly bigger, because when you pay about Rs. 5000 for a meal of 3, you sort-of expect to be filled to the hilt. But it wasn't so. But it was 5000 bucks well-spent for taste. Definitely well-spent if \"taste\" was (and mostly, it is) meant to be the star. I would just say, if they could slightly beef up their quantity too, it'll do wonders.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-12T03:34:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-12T20:01:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1352533620","name":"Sakina Nanabhai"},{"id":"1088748635","name":"Aqsa Shah"},{"id":"1241948621","name":"Nayab Shakil"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"100002608457065","name":"Haroona Khawar"},{"id":"100001249191882","name":"Fozia Amjad"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"628495513","name":"Fariha Harris"},{"id":"617371190","name":"Samar Mughal"},{"id":"100001697508377","name":"Hira Qazi"},{"id":"550700453","name":"Ammar Amjad"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1202678003","name":"Aisha Naayaab Rao"},{"id":"614747510","name":"Tariq Hameed Siddiqui"},{"id":"100001419761223","name":"Imran Malik"},{"id":"756768261","name":"Muhammad Aslam"},{"id":"535065551","name":"Hassan Khan"},{"id":"789225723","name":"Lalarukh Khursheed Farooqui"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM4MjM2MTI1Ng\u003d\u003d","before":"NTA4OTIyNTA5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"648625911855229","from":{"name":"Sajjad Ahmed","id":"1382361256"},"message":"well described!thanks....but 5000 rupees too much!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-12T04:35:05+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"648630128521474","from":{"name":"Ehtesham Maqbool","id":"189100160"},"message":"Nice detailed review.

Kolachi has really awesome food and is THE restaurant experience in the Phase 8 strip, if not the whole of Karachi itself. I love the new first-come-first-serve system, now we don?t have to go back disappointed learning the whole place is booked. After waiting a mere 5 minutes for our table we got a nice table on the deck. We ordered Lahori Fish as starters and although I am not a seafood fan but those finger fish are something special. They were tangy, slightly crispy and the sauce given with them complimented the dish excellently. For the main course we ordered the Kolachi Special Steak (Chicken), Paneer Reshmi and Chicken Turkey sandwich. The Kolachi Special Steak in beef is my humble opinion the best steak available in Karachi and the chicken one has come to par with it. The Paneer Reshmi with garlic and roghni naan was a delight as ever, however for our own guilty indulgence we also had it with paratha. The Chicken Turkey sandwich was a light yet fulfilling meal and tasted as a sandwich, I?m glad they don?t overdo it or give a small sampling, they just provide with what is expected in a good sandwich. I ordered the blue margarita drink which I enjoyed with my steak. My diet conscious friends had lemongrass tea after the meal and according to them it helped settle down the food, however my greedy tastebuds would only go for a sweet dessert after a good meal. We ordered Zafran and Pista Kulfi and again, Kolachi did not disappoint by giving an authentic taste yet a familiar feeling to the food that just makes you fell in love with it. You guys must have guessed that we are fans of Kolachi (like so many other people who have no complains with the place).

I was still reeling from that traumatic experience when I read 2 weeks later that the Al-Baik outlet was NOT affiliated with the actual Al-Baik in Saudi .. I have a feeling I might be reading something similar about BK in the local Dawn a coupla weeks later .. \n\nTo elaborate the BK outlet was at seaview .. was on a high after watching Gravity in 3D and appreciating our world and everything in it .. walked in to find very few people which was heartening .. finally I'd get my favorite BK mushroom n swiss without having to wait 2 hrs in line & without having to drive 2 hrs to Hardees .. Whopper is not my favorite due to both the presence of ketchup & the similarity to Mcdees quarter pounder .. Juggled between shroom n swiss & the BK fish burger before deciding on the double mushroom n swiss (Rs. 560). Then the series of Debacles:\n\n1. Waiting time after order placement - Instead of the standard 5-6 min, waited for 15 min before requesting for delivery at the table.\n\n2. While waiting for the order saw the floor manager take a cup meant for customers, pour out some soda, drink it and put it back in the cup holder .. he left .. I rubbed my eyes; maybe the space movie from earlier had messed with my senses .. realized he really had done the unthinkable .. called him, confronted him about it, he denied initially then admitted his mistake, took the cup out of the holder and discarded it and went about his business without a 2nd thought.\n\n3. Ok maybe they're learning, lets cut them some slack, the double shroom'll put everything right, I thought ... till the burger actually came at my table .. folded in a whopper jr wrapper .. a tiny kid's burger .. Aah it's ok they messed up my order, gave me the whopper jr meant for the 6 yr old cutie at my adjacent table .. I told the server \"Ye barabar walon ka order hai, mera nahi\" .. \"Nahi sir ye apka order hai, double mushroom n swiss!\" .. \"Aik min, yaheen kharre rahe raho\" .. opened the wrapper to find a tiny sandwich that begged to be forgotten .. postmartemed it to find a slice of local cheese over a single slice of 'pasanda' with 5 tiny shrooms on top .. i say pasanda because this pattie was half as thin as Mcdees cheeseburger .. and that's pretty damn thin .. I asked for the restaurant manager; he came all serious-faced asking what's wrong .. I asked him if this was a double mushroom n swiss? He said \"Sorry sir, single mushroom n swiss hai yeh, mai abhi double karwata hoon issko\" ... I questioned the size of the burger, the thickness of the pattie, the presence of the local cheese instead of swiss cheese and 5 tiny mushrooms & he confirmed me that the double version had an extra pattie, that being the only difference .. I asked him how he could justify selling this local pasanda burger, that wouldn't fill up my toddler's tummy, for Rs. 560 and how he could live with himself trying to sell this off as a Burger King burger? From serious-faced to Ashen-faced. He mumbled something inaudible. I decided the mushroom n swiss was off the cards and I best change my order. \"Please get me 2 Fish Burgers & chicken nuggets instead. Maybe you'll redeem yourself then\". I rued not having taking a snap of the burger to dissuade all you good people thinking of visiting.\n\n4. Asked for 2 fish burgers because the price (Rs. 290) made me realize that would be tiny too. But little did I know that I'd get a microwaved burger containing a fried then 'poached' fish pattie .. yes poached! .. the photo attached will show you moist bubbles in the center of the fish with 2 wrinkly soft burnt bun halves! ... Horrible!!\n\n5. The nuggets, their last chance at redemption were drier than an arab's sandal! .. fried to the extent that all the goodness, all the juice had been squeezed out of the chicken.\n\nI walked out in disgust, without paying the extra charge for the nuggets or the burger difference. I exercised exceptional self-control not further berating Mr. Ashen-face like he deserved. Gordon Ramsay'd probably burnt the place down if he'd visited instead of me. \nI expect to visit the wikileaks page in a coupla weeks time to read that the Burger King outlets in Karachi are knock-offs of the real thing .. low quality imitations (not even!) of the real product.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-11-02T22:51:10+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-09T04:40:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1620471256","name":"Shahbaz Javed Khan"},{"id":"587291629","name":"Saad Muhammed Sheikh"},{"id":"514440277","name":"M?ri?

First on the list was Fish hot and sour soup (white) which was the appetizer followed by the Dhaka finger fish the all time favorite, Jumbo prawn tempura and then the legendary Leather Jacket fillet in green masala, Fish Behari boti a new entrant as i had not tried it before, Pangush Boti Karahi,Chicken Fried Rice, Kids meal Crispy Chicken Burger Zinger,Garlic Nan, cold drinks and mineral water.\n\nOK, now for the mixed reviews i had been reading about Bots, well yes its has changed, it has evolved for the better and now is a proper food street fine dining dhaba style restaurant :)\nLimca stall was their earlier, now their a doc juice shop, i don't know the name of the doc but its good,dai bara stall and a pan stall plus loud music playing so the ambiance was definitely lively and more festive.\n\nNow coming to the revision in prices, yes their has been an slight increase in cost due to 16% GST but they are GST registered and the GST/SNTN is S3966140-7 and my bill had an addition of Rs.500, but rest assured it is being deposited in the national exchequer 100% which is cumulatively a substantial amount.\n\nThe real increase in prices is not that much considering they are delivering on quality and quantity, the fish was fresh, juicy, well marinated and had great flavor, as good as in the past if not better. The chatnis and the lemon add to the flavor too.\nThe service was quick and the food was served piping hot. Only one dish that was the Pangush Boti Karahi lacked flavor and was quite bland, i think that needs to be worked on and can improve with some minor adjustments.\n\nLadies and gentlemen Bots is known as the best seafood Dhabba in Karachi and upgraded its position now to a \"food street fine dining dhaba style restaurant\"\nnot a bad deal considering that a similar meal at a fine dining seafood joint would cost you 60% more with the frills and fancies, but as far as I am concerned the core issue is the product, and as long as I get value for money in terms of quality and quantity I am a happy camper indeed and plan to return to Bots soon for another round of scrumptious sea food delicacies.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-03T22:13:06+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-05T06:30:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"100000674735601","name":"Muhammad Patel"},{"id":"1004056348","name":"Zaryab Shaikh"},{"id":"100001433820134","name":"Hasan Raza"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"1413795365","name":"Hiba Jamali"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"521735682","name":"Aamir Shahnawaz"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"593601228","name":"Muhammad Saifullah"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100000446704703","name":"Almas Mehmood"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"564100900","name":"Fawad Hai"},{"id":"645099594","name":"Mujahid Iqbal"},{"id":"100002698452985","name":"Rabia Mahmood"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNjk4NDUyOTg1","before":"MTE5ODgzMTM3Ng\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"644634672254353","from":{"name":"Mahad Mustafa","id":"805150435"},"message":"Syed Zulfiqar Ali Kazmi!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-03T22:58:39+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"585210551","name":"Syed Zulfiqar Ali Kazmi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":23}]},{"id":"644851935565960","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Oh I see it now.

(My dad is an ultimate nakhray wale uncle:p like the one who calls a steak gosht ka tukda, a pizza 'roti utay boti' and so on) so I always opt for desi with dad since he tends to be very particular with expense directly proportional to taste! Went for an early dinner to Khanji and were seated immediately (1. the weather was lovely, I loved how I ate desi with those back support chairs I could sink into after a long tedious day). Moving to the menu, really extensive, efficiently put together... Ordered Mutton Peshaweri Karhai, Shish Taouk...on asking about the serving we were told there would be 6 pieces so we order yet another 2 items (we dint know they wudnt be tiny pieces, instead king kong pieces) ordered fish tikka and Namkeen Boti. Dad was disappointed for no tandoori roti and only having chapati as an option! Waiter immediately said they can get from another eatery and so we ordered both\nPumpkin Meetha(I don't eat pumpkins, cant say much :))\nThe POST MORTEM:\nMutton Peshaweri Karhai: Nothing like those al habib or Kolachi tastes! Distinct flavors, loved how tender the meat was (I do not eat mutton apart from home but i surprisingly did!). Maybe the right tinge of Peshawer 10/10\n\nNamkeem Boti: I thought they'd be somehow salty (Namkeem wohi hota hai na?) But I think well marinated Chicken with an unbelievably managed execution, 10/10\n\nShish Taouk: A different version of Malai Boti, perhaps with some arabic spices maybe? (y m i being a chef? lol I'd rate it 8/10)\n\nFarmaishi Chapatti : Loved it, literally chapati had some peshaweri khan baba ki rooh in it maybe? The tandoori rotiz kept sadofying while we had our hands onto the chapati\n\nFish Tikka: Uff...Uff...Uff...

Around 8 o clock, I received another call from the owner of WOK who showed great concern about the issue and wanted to send something complimentary to make up for the food sent earlier. He even asked what time specifically I would like to have my meal. I really appreciate this gesture because it shows that they really value their customers.\n\nThe food was delivered on time and was hot. The packaging was good and serving size was very generous. The food was very decent in taste this time specifically the Fish and Egg Fried Rice were very good. The only flaw was that there was no salt in the Vegetable Rolls whereas the Almond Chicken had a bit too much of salt. Anyway, I really appreciate the prompt response from the management and the owner himself.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-23T17:30:18+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-27T17:36:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"1065859702","name":"Ammara WAsti"},{"id":"592317993","name":"Muhammad Adil"},{"id":"530060365","name":"Abdul Wajid Qureshi"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"522977702","name":"Sheikh Hasan Rasul"},{"id":"734291566","name":"Baneen Shahbaz Ladak"},{"id":"554875549","name":"Imran Siddiqui"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"100000999733392","name":"Hadi Khan"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"516138880","name":"Salik Aleem"},{"id":"100000087144502","name":"Nadia Nadeem"},{"id":"1109359970","name":"Altaf Suleman"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100002348421122","name":"Aahad Zubairi"},{"id":"849920390","name":"Umer Rashid"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"734678626","name":"Rubaya Zia Khan"},{"id":"100002505633547","name":"Umme Kulsoom Khalid Ahmed"},{"id":"100002619919449","name":"Maleeha Athar Zubairi"},{"id":"1206288860","name":"Sundila Sadiq"},{"id":"100003216046346","name":"Shezi Memon"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAzMjE2MDQ2MzQ2","before":"NzIwMjE3NjIy"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_623376991046788/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTAwMDAzMjE2MDQ2MzQ2"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"623378421046645","from":{"name":"Syed Abdul Haye","id":"510482528"},"message":"haha @no salt","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-23T17:33:11+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"623378927713261","from":{"name":"Moazzam Husain","id":"559218922"},"message":"Thanks for sharing Sadia.

Proper tiny boxes, was warm even when I opened it at home. \n\nYet again they have managed to make me very happy.

The menu was Beef Lasagna w/garlic bread, Chicken Tarragon, Penne Arrabiata, Fish & Chips, Ice cream for dessert and cold drinks. Everything was prepared wonderfully well and compliments were abundant for all the dishes. It is hard to please teenagers and faculty alike when it comes to food but everyone was unequivocal in their praise. The food was served on time and despite the great appetites involved, there was more than enough to go around and then some! Thank you Imran and the Pizzo staff, as well as to Omar Jafar for helping me to pick the right menu and coming in on budget. You can count on our recommendation to anyone looking to host an event and repeat business from Southshore!

Earlier this week I went with friends twice to the actual Shabaz outlet to eat, plus ordered in loads of food for the whole family a couple of days later so ended up trying more variety than usual (feedback on dishes below) - and everyone I have introduced to Cafeela has been seriously impressed, and wondering how they haven't discovered it before. The Sizzling bhindi, which has always been delicious (and more importantly light and healthy - as most bhindi dishes in Pakistan are cooked heavy on the oil), was even more so when we actually had it fresh and crispy in the restaurant on the sizzling hot plate. The Paneer tikka which has recently been introduced to the menu (after I've been pestering them for nearly a year to add it, as I love it as a dish and knew Cafeela's chef would do it well), was soft and flavoursome. Palak Paneer was packed full of taste, and as ever very light on the oil, my friends were raving about the Moong masoor daal and Anda ghotala, though didn't much care for the Daal chana fry (too oily). The Fish barbq boti is great (although on that dish I will say the pieces could be bigger), and Papaya salad and Thai beef salad (the latter they will substitute paneer for the beef if you're vegetarian) was better than at the Thai restaurants I've tried. As for chicken and meat dishes, I can't review them as I don't eat meat apart from seafood, but my fam / friends who tried those dishes really enjoyed them. Keep it up Cafeela team and Zahoor Ahmed!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-25T10:59:13+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-25T19:26:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"500778016","name":"Hammad Munir"},{"id":"724148371","name":"Rabia Hai"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"511882940","name":"Uzma B"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE5MjM1ODcz","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"609356849115469","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"One of the few places to get raving reviews from everyone.

A place of traditional Desi  Khaba and it is quite famous that they usually eat with their full?. Love to eat ?.Specially Desi Ghee Stuff either its Karahi either its Fish or etc.\nUnfortunately the both guests by profession were Doctor?s even one of them was a highly known surgeon \n@ 9.25 I reached at kolachi before that I had ?NO? reservation I thought its Monday so at Do Darya it will No Crowded at kolachi ..When I reached it was packed jam and on call it was 56# minimum 1 hour wait?\nI know the owner?s Owais very well and even Umair but both of them were not present suddenly I asked from a attendant who else is looking after him. He took Mr.Amir Name I want to that guy directly and I just simply request him that we are four people and I have guest from Lahore and I called Awais for the reservation however I was dishonest  itna to chalta hai na yar!\nYou know what he did he moved us all the way on a prime location on top which was really WOW. It was full moon yesterday and the view was extremely awesome don?t have words to express. \nI order Fish, Grilled BBQ Prawns, Chicken Reshmi Kabab,Peshawari Karahi,?.\nThe best part was they served in once and it was well maintained in temperature, Quality & quantity \nThe Guest was impressed by the Fish Taste!  Usually they had fry fish in Lahore ,Sardar or Bashir Darulmahi wala are best in Lahore but again the difference was fresh water and a Sea Fish.\nI was stunned by the service standards the best part was after every 5-10 minute there was one new attendant coming and asking need anything else sir, you liked the food etc. \nI strongly believe one should have to profuse with his service standards in a completion war either its taste either its services should have to up come with its own standard?s and have the raise the bar which I guess kolachi did in real.\nThe best part wow to WaoOOoo factor was I asked him for the bill which was 11,000 for four people I just had a pause that I took 6000 cash which I thought will be enough I was like Wooooffffffffffff I checked the bill again and call the waiter are you sure it?s mine twice he said ?yes? Sir then I asked again politely just have another confirmation unfortunately the bill was exchanged with other table he made apology on this but I guess it was another great experience with Kolachi?.\nOvais,Umair & Amir, Great Work Guys \nKeep the Bar high and for other Restaurant?s I don?t want you to get disappoint but dear all serious time to think!\nValue against Money !","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-20T09:02:23+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-21T07:01:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"685959051","name":"Ali Hasan"},{"id":"100001252885971","name":"Marium Sultana"},{"id":"1048532624","name":"Syed Nawfil Rahim"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"789225723","name":"Lalarukh Khursheed Farooqui"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"},{"id":"698359177","name":"Mashal Iftikhar"},{"id":"752330337","name":"Faiz Kazi"},{"id":"558178102","name":"Safoora Fahad"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg1NTA1ODY2","before":"NTI0NDc2NzM1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"606461179405036","from":{"name":"Noveen Siddiqui","id":"520455792"},"message":"Lovvvv this post!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T10:26:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606481659402988","from":{"name":"Syed Nawfil Rahim","id":"1048532624"},"message":"Kolachi make you say WOW!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T11:42:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606561942728293","from":{"name":"Huma Zunnoon Khan","id":"100000710303249"},"message":"wondering wat if the bill was correct ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T13:26:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606562169394937","from":{"name":"Huma Zunnoon Khan","id":"100000710303249"},"message":"* wld have been","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T13:27:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606568629394291","from":{"name":"Noveen Siddiqui","id":"520455792"},"message":"Huma kitni buri baat hai...

Hakka Chinese with Mughal Decor.  Red Emperor is as much Hakka, as Ginsoy is Extreme.  The service was terribly slow, and there seemed absence of basic protocol.  Cutlery was missing (even though table was reserved in advance), the place ran out of napkins, no one bothered taking order for drinks (despite reminders), and it took at least twenty minutes before water was finally served (after repeated reminders).  \n\nSoup was served 30 minutes after the order was placed, while the rest of the dishes were served after a solid wait of 50 minutes.  Even then there were order mix-ups, and the staff just wasn't aware of what's happening.  And like always, the excuse was the typical old school one, 'sir aaj rush zyada hai...' -- fair enough.  \n\nThe food is typical Desi-fied Chinese, and hence it doesn't really have any distinct flavor.  Tried the Chicken Schezwan Soup, Fish in Tamarind Sauce, Mixed Fried Rice, Beef Chili Chowmein, and the Sichuan Chicken.  Nothing special about the flavor of any entree.  The serving sizes were massive, making it a favored choice for a value seeker.  With per head cost of roughly PKR500, Red Emperor is a pretty reasonable Desi Chinese option.\n\nThe service is a major bummer, and the food is just fine -- nothing special about it.  The place doesn't really have any differentiating factor, and is equally good (or bad) as Ginsory, or Jade Garden.\n\nNot recommended if one is looking for a smooth flavorful dinner experience.\n\nOverall Rating -- 6/10\n\nOn a side note -- the lightning at the place is just too dim, making going over the menu, and the bill, an arduous task.  I like to see my food -- why can't certain restaurants be more brighter!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-15T00:26:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-15T12:51:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"646760193","name":"Rehma Tirmizey"},{"id":"556911379","name":"Shaheer Hassan"},{"id":"769030393","name":"Muhammad Danniyal Jafri"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"1560344939","name":"Zahid Qureshi"},{"id":"1488962130","name":"Zulfiqar Ali"},{"id":"100001207576659","name":"Faisal Rafiq"},{"id":"100005945647613","name":"Sara H Khan"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"832750315","name":"Romano Karim Yusuf"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"873280323","name":"Umair Zia"},{"id":"801035182","name":"Asad Kamran"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"512542175","name":"Nabiya Fahad Khan"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"684094046","name":"Faiza Hasan"},{"id":"1346742308","name":"Ijlal Malik"},{"id":"1191501552","name":"Ali Majeed S T"},{"id":"561575202","name":"Usuf Haroon"},{"id":"647940246","name":"Maheen Khan Omair"},{"id":"523153232","name":"Hira Humayun"},{"id":"757255502","name":"Faryal Naeem Warind"},{"id":"502333997","name":"Annie Adnan Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAyMzMzOTk3","before":"NjQ2NzYwMTkz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_603313529719801/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTAyMzMzOTk3"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"603412379709916","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Great review once again.

A perfectly grilled steak with a simple sauce of herbs and garlic, it was like the foodie-angels were at work in the HLS kitchen! Of course this was followed by the mocha caramel, the restaurant's best and most divinely inspired dessert, and a nice cup of tea. Best of all, I must give the Purchasing Officer a great big thank you who went and brought me medicine from the nearby chemist, rather than our night-out be disrupted.

Had some squash juices and milk roohafza on the table prior Iftar, the iftar menu was fine, later when it came to the mains that is when i started regretting LQ. The food variety was not big and it lacked quality and taste, opted for tempura prawns and there it lied a small prawn in the big oily crispy coating. Then went for some BBQ. It was so so, then found something with a name tag of Shahzada Salim Khas.. on my curiosity i took a bit and there it was Pasta Alfredo. Seriously did the mughals had Pastas at that time LOL. That is some serious Epic Joke. Out of all those dishes around this was re-named. Went on to Fish Tikka, too much salt in it with no such flavors. The chinese almost ended. Then tried Sajji, it did some justice compared to other food. It was later I shifted to Deserts and had some bit of various sweets. The Shahi Tukra had nothing Shahi in them !! The labe shereen was fine others were upto LQ expectations !! The food was seriously low quality and taste, with attentive service. Rs 1250/- per head exclusive drinks. Seriously it does not in any way does justice. Went to Kolachi a week ago and i Must say it was worth every penny. I would give LQ 2/10.

Recommend Mao Kung Pao Chicken, Mao Orange Chicken, Mao Beef in Black Bean Sauce and Mao Szechwan Spicy Chicken from their New Chinese Menu.  In case you wanna order Thai, their New Dish \"Mao Red Curry\" is a must try and it goes great with Jasmine Rice.  All time favorites are Thai Beef in Oyster Sauce, Stir Fried Chicken with Roasted Cashews, Chicken with Cashew Nuts, Chicken in Tamarind Sauce, Beef with Garlic and Pepper, Crispy Fish and Spicy Thai Fried Noodles.  All dishes go very well with Steamed Jasmine Rice. And while you are ordering from Chairman Mao, I'd highly recommend you order their Gelato, my favorite flavors being Chocolate, Coffee, Ferrero and Mint Chocolate Chip.  Btw, I also love their Japanese menu and find their Sushi to be better than what is served at Sakura and Fujiyama.

For the past 2 years I am residing in Karachi and my hunt for best Nihari is still not over. I have tried Zahid Nihari, Javed Nihari, Nihari Inn, Delhi Muslim, Delhi Sohail, Waheed and Ghaffar in Bahadurabad. So far I have not found the original \"Bong\" in Karachi but as far as Nihari is concerned, Delhi Ghaffar beats every Nihari restaurant in Karachi (I know most of the people wont agree with me on this). But if I talk about my overall Nihari experience, Waris Nihari in Lahore is simply unbeatable. I still have to try Sabri Nihari in Saddar and I have high hopes from it.

And I don't doubt that for a bit. I have been dining in some of Do Darya's best-kept secrets for many months now, and I must say it's quite an experience. This so-called food revolution happening in the area has seen many of the country?s best new restaurants sprouting like mushrooms in this scenic area. And for those of you searching for a culinary experience like no other, look no further than Sajjad restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant is renovated recently with the special addition of huts on the sea, unlike other restaurants who have the seating arrangements / tables quite off the sea area. However, the interior will remind visitors of a minimalist. The decor allows the simplistic beauty of the food to really shine, though beauty isn't the only thing bringing folks to Sajjad. The restaurant buzzed with excited energy and was comfortably full with seemingly satisfied patrons.\n\nWhen we reached there, we witnessed an unusual rush and a lot of cars parked already including rushing media vehicles and few dozens of private security vans. When inquired, it was revealed that some ministers and a lot of media, like a bee looking for a beautiful flower, were there. The restaurant's capacity is maximum 800 people and i was Gobsmacked when the person on the welcome desk told us that there are already more than 950 people there, a lot others willing to stand and few desperate to sit on the grass and pay the full amount. Early reservations always save us from embarrassment especially when one is accompanied with friends or guests. Similarly; the timely reservations made earlier on the day, we were induced to our table with a reservation platen / tablet. The placement of  our table was actually the starting of the stupendous experience we have had later last night. It felt that we were in the middle of the sea. The best part was not only the comfortable sofa and lighting but also the privacy. When we go to the other eateries located at Do Darya, the placement of tables or seating arrangement is too congested /crowded. One can easily hear what the other person is talking on the other table. Fortunately, that was not the case there. Also the lamp which lit the table was soft and did not hurt the eyes. There was a bottle of Hand Sanitizer on all the tables.  \n(Picture is attached) \n\nFOOD\nFor Iftar, nicely packed dates in a plate were served with Roohafza Sharbat in milk/water. The Rooh afza Sharbat actually brought back a lot of child hood memories and it quenched our thirst while breaking the fast. Since there was rush; as mentioned earliar and the typical buffet mentality, to fill the plates unnecessarily and the competition, look I have the most on my plate! the items for Iftar finished quickly. Lo and behold, it appeared the staff was well trained to deal with such panic stricken crowd and situations, in few seconds, another serving was brought. Believe you me, fresh and more quantity than before. I detest to mention this here but I witnessed with my own eyes that people who were there in their Chauffeur driven cars, filled another plate and called their drivers to have it. The staff still did not say anything and it seemed their smiling faces spoke a lot. Literate, Ill-literate and A-literate :)\n\nMy friends and I went for namaz and decided to take the Iftar items, if left by the mob, after namaz. To our utter surprise, the restaurant staff kept on refilling the items, fresh and sizzling hot, after namaz too unlike other restaurants where they do not refill after namaz and focus only on dinner items once the fast is over. By the way, they had Wazu place and proper arrangements for both ladies and gents for Namaz/prayers.\n\nThere were almost nineteen (not really sure and please blame my taste buds) Pakistani dishes for dinner. Starting from Sajji to Lamb ( Kuzu Tandir Aakha dumba or Grilled meat of lamb) Prawn Tempura, Fish, Live BBQ items , Live all sort of Tandoor/Naan,  Nehari, few different types of Biryanis and a touch of continental food in form of 3 to 4 chicken and beef items, Cheese Pasta, variety of Chinese and honestly there was so much, I have forgotten the names already. The taste was divine! No exaggeration but I have never tasted such delicious food in my life ever. Not to forget, all that happening where that competition going on in the crowd, who has the most food on one?s plate! :D I would rate 10 out 10 to the food.\n\nThere were different variety of salads and all the dishes had a name tag. There were a few desserts, but they finished quickly so waiting was the only option. While we were waiting, we saw Kakark Dooh Patti Chai (tea) being cooked live. What else could caffeine lovers dream of? Not to forget, very few places where Tea is part of the Buffet. We all had our tea and mean while dessert bar was set up again. My rating for dessert is 7.5 out of 10.\nThere?s no doubt at Sajjad Restaurant will quickly become the hottest reservation in town! \n\nAlbeit there were Janitors cleaning the over all restaurant then and there, one thing Sajjad Restaurant people should work on is cleanliness in the rest room. I am just not writing this here likeother  people who have bad experiences of other places and without talking to the concerned people of the restaurant, they mention it here. Actually I spoke to the restaurant staff near the wash room area and told them about it, where they told me about the huge crowd using the loo,  and the reason was valid. It was not surprising for me when they told me that they place napkins/ tissue papers time to time but there are few customers who do not hesitate to take the tissue roll /napkins, hand sanitizers and place it in their pockets or bags! After all they pay a good amount; so, without any judgement, according to them, they are entitled for the toiletries as well! :-)","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-07-20T01:25:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-20T09:21:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"535211286","name":"Abdul Aziz Anis"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"611818619","name":"Humaira Shakil"},{"id":"100001715666710","name":"Razak Latif"},{"id":"1049298397","name":"Sadiya Naveed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"100001098310753","name":"Ashfaq Parekh"},{"id":"1170084800","name":"Ammaar Ahmed"},{"id":"761278691","name":"Abdullah Soomro"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"657151302","name":"Nishat Mustafa"},{"id":"509686069","name":"Hasaan Mubasher Sheikh"},{"id":"619270706","name":"???

But, this time I went with my mother. Now, I've tried their Chapli Kebabs, Nihari and all the Heaven/ Hell burgers, which is the good stuff, so I wanted something different. Anyway, here's my review:\n\nMind you, I've had amazing experiences before of this place. Nobody came to take the order, so I had to make a shout to the waiter to do so. -__- Then, as we were sitting, I just took the lid off the sugar pot, and out poured a gazillion ants. I didn't create a fuss or anything, and since I didn't take my phone, there are no pictures. However, the guy took the pot away and cleaned it up. \n\nMom ordered Fish and Chips, and I, bereft of choice, went for the Rooster Steak, which I was informed was the larger version of the Chic Steak. Didn't get the espresso shots. We also ordered fries. The first set of fries came earlier than the meal, and they were fine. Mom really liked her fish and chips too. But, the steak was a real disappointment. Being a steak lover, I was hoping for the same level or at least close to what we get at Roasters or Flo. Sadly, for the upsized version which was served on a humongous platter, I got two very thinly cut strips of chicken, with a dip that was just way too much compared to the 'steak'. The price? Same as what you'd pay at Roasters for a good steak (Wild Mushroom/ Monterrey Chicken). I fail to visualize the size of the smaller one. Then, midway through the meal, I ordered more fries, which came very late. We had long finished the meal, and since there wasn't a sign of the fries, I called the guy. He said 'fries mei hi subse ziada dair lagti hai', which was really confusing. Anyway, they arrived twenty minutes after the meal had finished and nobody was in the mood to eat by then. \n\nSo, in a gist, the fries were great, the fish and chips were great, but steaks aren't their strongest suit. Serving times were tremendously slow this night. And, nobody likes being greeted by ants the minute you sit down on a table. And, that's all. I hope Quddusi Sahab takes notice and they improve their standards, without letting complacency become a factor. Cheers, y'all.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-10T18:42:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-10T19:17:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"671250001","name":"Noman Iqbal"},{"id":"100000420764459","name":"Sana Shakir"},{"id":"604074782","name":"Farheen Jeelani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA0MDc0Nzgy","before":"NjcxMjUwMDAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"583393721711782","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"noted with concern, both issues will be sorted out tomorrow, really sorry to read, i was around but pre occupied for tomorrow, will get back to you, plz apologies to yr mother from my side","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-10T19:14:46+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"583394268378394","from":{"name":"Najm Ahmed","id":"885480695"},"message":"Yes, I saw you behind the counter.

Was pleasantly surprised. A humble environment but very neat and clean. My wife and I are on a moderate diet so we grilled the server about dishes that could be served without rice and noodles. Instead of throwing his hands up (like so many people do nowadays), he smartly suggested the drier dishes (Kung Pao Chicken and Fish in Tamarind sauce). For starters we got the hot and sour soups. The soups were not bad but the stars were the main dishes. Fresh, tasty and packed full of flavor - the taste was a departure from the wasteland of Pakistani-styled Chinese dishes. Overall, not overly spicy either, which is always appreciated. Overall, if you're looking for good Chinese food without the frills, The Lantern is a great place to be. Good food. Great service and a quaint atmosphere to boot. Good job guys.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-04T08:45:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-04T14:29:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001882596023","name":"Mansoor Zaheer"},{"id":"506243943","name":"Saud Ahmed"},{"id":"512612823","name":"Leena Faruqui"},{"id":"829355187","name":"Sadaf Sarwar"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"100000087144502","name":"Nadia Nadeem"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"570778381","name":"Safia Ali"},{"id":"514286144","name":"Lamaan Malik"},{"id":"502280426","name":"Husnain Zahid"},{"id":"571870541","name":"Faizan Yousuf"},{"id":"645995992","name":"Rida Sadiq"},{"id":"1382454645","name":"Shariq Jamil"},{"id":"647041983","name":"Haseeb Chaudhry"},{"id":"649049339","name":"Basit Saeed"},{"id":"639961936","name":"Moiz A.

Mirage is the only buffet themed restaurant at Do-Darya and is located right next to Kolachi. The ambience is nothing to write about as it?s almost the same as Kolachi, Charcoal, etc. We booked the whole upper deck unanimously for the view and later regretted the decision as the main food stations were downstairs.\nThe food stations are divided into 3 areas. The main food station is at the entrance while the BBQ section is at the upper left corner of the restaurant. The dessert and salad bar is in the top right corner.\nFor the price (Rs. 1000 per person inclusive of 1 soft drink) the food was very good. There were fresh batair?s (better than Lal-Qila?s), fried prawn tempura, Chicken Biryani, Goan Fish Curry, Chapli Kabab, pani puri are just some of the dishes that were tasted. The highlights however were the BBQ and the live chicken Karhai. The BBQ consisted of Chicken Malai Boti, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Chicken Tikka and Beef Namkeen Boti. The Malai Boti was succulent (but a little sweet for my taste) while Reshmi Kabab and Tikka were awesomely cooked (and Thank God not overcooked)  bu the Beef Namkeen Boti stole the show as it literally melted in our mouths.\nThe Karhai also has 4 varieties namely Peneer White, Peshawari Red, Green Masala and Namkeen Red Karhai. All four varieties were delicious and much better than what Kolachi serves.\nThe let down at Mirage were the salad and dessert station due to same variety as other buffets and also fried fish and the pasta dishes.\nOverall we really enjoyed our food and had a fantastic evening. Best part was that there was no hassle from the waiters or the mangers to clear the table (like they do at Kolachi & Ginsoy).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-27T18:52:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T09:29:10+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"736425186","name":"Maryam Zahoor Ansari"},{"id":"772910592","name":"Shyam Sunder"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"100000226962956","name":"Sumiaya Arif"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"711050864","name":"Abdul Raheem Khan"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"NzM2NDI1MTg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"548935991824222","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Aaquib Arif","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-27T21:28:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"549210141796807","from":{"name":"Zarfras Siddiki","id":"100003898006618"},"message":"seems they(Kolachi and Ginsoy) are quite busy in their business and they care for walk in customers,to avoid waiting in queue,,caring for customers by Kolachi and Ginsoy thats good,,","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T08:19:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549233218461166","from":{"name":"Muhammed Umer Mulla","id":"595408686"},"message":"Well yes but what if you are in thr middle of a meal and the bill is presented to you or when you try to relax the waiter constantly remind you to clear the table as they have a big cue....I mean can't they wait for say 5 mins","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T09:48:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549380488446439","from":{"name":"Sumiaya Arif","id":"100000226962956"},"message":"I second that muhammed umer mulla","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T14:42:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549876995063455","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"5-7 Mins should be max before which the Bill sould be asked for & settled.

The only consistency was the hour long delivery time. The fish in the fish and chips used to be the size and thickness of a grown mans hand -tonight much, much smaller and so thin I peeled off the layer of batter to uncover a sliver, literally, of fish. And then more battered crumbs. Very disappointed. The prawn biryani that was delivered was a single though we ordered a double (and were charged for a double)  and barely had prawns.

The place has a great ambiance outside with a beautiful garden, however it was too cold so in we went. The interior isn't bad either, they've really worked on making it feel like Thailand with busts of Buddha, even the music was thai pop.\n We went for a chicken salad for starters, i think it was called the Yum Gai, really fresh and perfectly seasoned with the chili well balance with lime and salt. \nNext came the mains, Tamarind Fish, Thai Green Curry and Jasmine Steamed rice. Again, the flavors were really well balanced and the fish was cooked to perfection, crispy but not hard on the outside and yet not overcooked. The green curry was thicker then we're used to but the flavors were great!\nMy wife is a Thai food aficionado and she couldn't get enough, mind you we had lahori sized servings!!\nThe service was quick and efficient, how much of it was down to the low weeknight traffic  cannot be determined. The only downer was the loud music, which was not needed as there weren't many customers. A great place for Thai food, probably better than the popular Karachi joints.\nNezihe Hussain","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-11T18:27:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-11T18:49:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"},{"id":"514605350","name":"Ruquia Jawed-Hammad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE0NjA1MzUw","before":"MTAwMDAwMjQ1MDc0MTk1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"504224602962028","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Hammad Umer - thank you for being such a sporty SWOTTIE.\n\ni love reviews like this where all ends well","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-11T18:49:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"622355253","name":"Hammad Umer","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA0MjI0NjAyOTYyMDI4","before":"NTA0MjI0NjAyOTYyMDI4"}}},"restaurantName":"Fish"},{"id":"165861103465048_504054689645686","from":{"name":"Haroon Leghari","id":"100000059823691"},"message":"Hook Line & Sinker ( HLS ) ...Tonight on our specials menu we are serving; Cream of Asparagus Soup, Crab and Artichok Dip, Mediteranean Chicken Tornados, Steak aux Poivre, Grilled Lobster with mediteranean garnish, Chilli Jumbo Prawns, Lobster ala Marvi, Grilled Trout with Pepper Lime...also on our regular menu we are running with Lobster Thermidor, Crab Grattin, Zesty Red Snapper, Sabzwari Crabs, Prawns ala Rooni, Seafood Katakat, Grilled Seabass, Traditional Fish & Chips, Thai Prawns, Oriental Oven baked Fish and many more mouthwatering dishes for your pleasure...Reservations Number: 03000200457","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-11T10:19:01+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-11T14:46:25+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"521690093","name":"Louie Sh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTIxNjkwMDkz","before":"NTIxNjkwMDkz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"504115152972973","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"I hate you.

I am sure to most people who have been to ?44? can back me on saying that the place has ?ambiance?. Some aura in the air about it, that is almost indescribable about the ambiance. Its food and atmosphere can stand ?almost? toe to toe to the best out there in Karachi. \n\nWe contacted the semi owner of the place Mr. Aman on Monday about the party to be hosted tonight. He invited us over to discuss the menu on which we decided on a buffet menu as following: \nHot & Sour soup \nThai Chicken Salad\nPapaya Salad \nHoney glazed BBQ smoked wings\nPan fried Sea bass with lemon thyme sauce\nRed Thai chicken curry\nChili & Basil Beef\nFried Rice \nRed sauce pasta (simple pasta olives and vegetables)\nFudge cake. \n\nNow my family was a bit skeptical that a restaurant that is not used to serve buffet will be able to manage it. Well the food was amazing the Hot & Sour soup was different from the usual out there and tasteful. Pasta was ordinary but that was expected. Fish & the beef get a special mention because everyone raved about it. \nNow you must have noticed the ?almost? part in my heading. 44 lost out on two things one very small that is the refilling of the buffet was a bit slow but not so slow that you would cry over it. But the major disappointment was the dessert it was in fact what all our guests did actually complaint about, it was a huge disappointment it was dry, fudge was barely existent. And I really hope they improve on that part. All in all i would recommend the place but not for the dessert.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-31T11:24:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-02T10:14:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"871750088","name":"Adnan Rao"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"2320004","name":"Hassan Baweja"},{"id":"529620428","name":"Roomana Nasir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI5NjIwNDI4","before":"MTEzNTIzNjMzOQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"498497360201419","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Fair and thorough review.

The \"Gosht Nu Dhansak\" (Mutton Daal with Brown Rice) with the kachumar and two types of achaars stole the show, specially the limun aur mirch ka achaar which is made with lemon, ginger and green chillies soaked in lemon juice made me go back over 25 years when this used to be made in our house. Not a big fan of eggs but I must say both the Akoori (scrambled eggs) and Scotch Eggs, both were pretty decent. My earliest memories of Akoori dates back to over 30 years when it was served as a snack in the evenings in the lawns and tennis courts of Karachi Club. The Kolmi Na Kevab (Prawn Kebabs) was very interesting. Was so satisfied with the Dhansak that I didn't try the \"Patra Ni Machi\" (Fish in Green Chutney rolled in Banana Leaves). The \"Lagan Nu Custard\", \"Malpuras\" and \"Savaiyyan\" for dessert were so different and delicious - could not stop my hand at \"Savaiyyan\" and ended up having two large helpings of it.

My 2 other (older) kids also love sea food so BOTS was an obvious choice for us. We reached there at 9m, ordered Red Fish Finger and Dhaka Fish Finger, Fried Prawns and Prawns Karhai.  The service was prompt and the food as good as always. While we were enjoying our meal, our newest addition to the family felt left out and insisted on tying the Dhaka Fish Finger so wifey gave her a small piece and...whoa...it was like love at first bite for her (although technically she cant bite right now) . To our surprise, she had quite a few pieces after that and thoroughly enjoyed the meal.  Guess some of us have only acquired the BOTS taste, this generation is born with it. \n\nMy kids went to Ali Raza to thank him for a lovely meal and he reciprocated and came to meet us as well.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-03T13:16:13+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-05T08:44:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1551738621","name":"Syed Yousuf A?idi"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"741385426","name":"Riaz Salim"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"751819688","name":"Erum Hamza"},{"id":"512589628","name":"Jawwad Raza"},{"id":"100000860154915","name":"Aman Jaffery"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"617680709","name":"Fatima Ali Rizvi"},{"id":"751030900","name":"Zoha Manzar"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"631611761","name":"Adnan Zafar"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"528525436","name":"Umtus Sanna Hussain-Mirza"},{"id":"591211818","name":"Hafsa Zulfiqar"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3Mjg3Mzkz","before":"MTU1MTczODYyMQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"467861749931647","from":{"name":"Sharmeen Sharif","id":"702746868"},"message":"Well Aneek I have ordered BOTS twice but both times I was really disappointed with their service :( ....the first time I ordered they sent me something different from what I actually ordered ...

Starting with exceptional wings that made me realize just how much I had missed them to the revamped mozzarella sticks, fries and spicy ladies ... appetizers were cleaned up in no time. Fish & chips and a club sandwich were similarly enjoyed but the highlight had to be our trip to hell!\n\nNajam Quddusi does not mess around with his food and the \"burger from hell\" lives up to the name. It is huge, smothered in cheese and jalapenos, spicy in a good way if you can get past the initial explosion when the first bite hits your mouth! Thoroughly enjoyed the BFH and highly recommend it to those who are ready to eat a massive, spicy burger ... I won't even mention the mountain of fries that accompany it.\n\nIt goes without saying that we enjoyed the company of the owner as he is always fun to chat with and a gracious host, especially to our toddler who ran around the newly revamped decor of the Log Inn Lounge as if he owned the place! That said, the new look is very open and welcoming ... a change for the better ... even though our son Ali missed the Takhat but found a model horse he could play with instead!

The condiments though were very sparse. The mushroom mini had a single sliver of a tiny mushroom, the blue cheese was the size of 1Rs coin - didn't really get that part. The wedges were nice but there should be more than 3!\nOrdered the Fish and Chips - complete disappointment for my friend.

Found the same dishes we had eaten before to have lost flavour and tasted quite bland. Prawn crackers were over fried and some stale, the hot and sour soup we actually really used to enjoy had a weird taste and smell to it. The main courses also were not up to the mark. Had a long chat with the manager to whom we showed the dishes and asked him to taste as well as we hardly touched our food after first couple of bites.

The idea is wonderful but i wonder why all the plants and trees were very average type. Nothing extra ordinary, nothing exotic, nothing really to talk about. Yes it was very green but gave a jungle feel. Untrimmed trees, no music. \nMenu: 1/10\nWho puts Fries on the list of appetizers? Under Pasta there were only 2. \"Alfredo\" and \"Arabiata\". We were really lost as in what type of pasta, and proteins and/or veggies it came with since there was no description or anything. Staff is very new, no one really knew what was in it either. The server ran twice in the kitchen to ask. Expected a little more than just a very average, limited menu. \nFood: 3/10\nOrdered Chicken with almond and strawberry sauce, Fish and boneless buffalo wings between 2 people. Food was all a bit cold-ish. The sauce on the chicken was good, sweet and nutty in flavor with the essence of rosemary, came with saut?ed veggies. However the chicken to very thinly cut, breaded and fried. I was looking forward to a whole breast piece, a good juicy meaty chicken. It was really thin sliced and dry. The fish was a bit better, after the first bite, found hair so really cannot comment. The wings were on the same lines as the chicken, just thinner with a buffalo sauce dip. Again, very disappointing..\nService: 4/10\nGiven it is a new restaurant, but the manager had no knowledge about the menu. He said the chicken came with 'chips'. When the entree arrived we inquired about the 'chips' and he brought us a plate of fries. We let him know about the hair in the Fish, the chef said it probably flew in since we were sitting outside.

The idea is wonderful but i wonder why all the plants and trees were very average type. Nothing extra ordinary, nothing exotic, nothing really to talk about. Yes it was very green but gave a jungle feel. Untrimmed trees, no music. \nMenu: 1/10\nWho puts Fries on the list of appetizers? Under Pasta there were only 2. \"Alfredo\" and \"Arabiata\". We were really lost as in what type of pasta, and proteins and/or veggies it came with since there was no description or anything. Staff is very new, no one really knew what was in it either. The server ran twice in the kitchen to ask. Expected a little more than just a very average, limited menu. \nFood: 3/10\nOrdered Chicken with almond and strawberry sauce, Fish and boneless buffalo wings between 2 people. Food was all a bit cold-ish. The sauce on the chicken was good, sweet and nutty in flavor with the essence of rosemary, came with saut?ed veggies. However the chicken to very thinly cut, breaded and fried. I was looking forward to a whole breast piece, a good juicy meaty chicken. It was really thin sliced and dry. The fish was a bit better, after the first bite, found hair so really cannot comment. The wings were on the same lines as the chicken, just thinner with a buffalo sauce dip. Again, very disappointing..\nService: 4/10\nGiven it is a new restaurant, but the manager had no knowledge about the menu. He said the chicken came with 'chips'. When the entree arrived we inquired about the 'chips' and he brought us a plate of fries. We let him know about the hair in the Fish, the chef said it probably flew in since we were sitting outside.

We ordered Chicken in Pandan Leaves, Tom Yum wz Noodles, Pad Thai, Thai Fried Rice wz Baby Corn & Mushroom and Thai Iced Tea.\n\nLove: Chicken in Pandan Leaves, Pad Thai and Thai Iced Tea. \nChicken in Pandan Leaves was really good, meat was succulent and love the sauce too. Pad Thai, another tasty one but of coz I had tasted better ones in Bangkok and  the Thai Iced Tea was great, really love it!\n\nDownside: Tom Yum wz Noodles and Thai Fried Fish wz Baby Corn and Mushroom.\nWe had to order Chicken in our Tom Yum coz the hub has allergy reaction to prawns. We felt that the Tom Yum lacked flavours and I find it sweet for my liking and it wasnt spicy enough (for me). Thai Fried Rice - the taste is somewhat like the normal Chinese Fried Rice that we have here in Khi. Nothing special about it and it lacked salt.\n\nTotal bill was about Rs2000 which we think is reasonable.

Out of the three drinks on the buffet - Rooh Afza, Lemonade and Tamarind Juice - the Tamarind juice was a winner for me. \n\nThe dinner buffet opened after an interval, and although the offerings were limited in variety, the taste was mind-blowing! Thai Chicken Curry, Beef Medallions in peppercorn sauce, and Fish & Crab Balls in Chinese Sauce were absolutely finger-looking good, and I wished I had held back on the iftar consumption a little to enjoy the dinner entr?es more. The only glitch was that the garlic rice and chowmein took forever to reload and there were long gaps between refills of the rest of the entr?es too, which led people to constantly hover around the buffet. \n\nThe desserts were an absolute delight as well. Chocolate Brownies, Cream caramel, Fudge Cake, chocolate balls, pineapple cake, and fresh fruits just made for a very indulgent end to the meal, and I even forgot about the Hazelnut Dream Cake that awaited us at home. :)\n\nThis, however, was not the end of the meal! Aman Virjee made a lovely gesture of sending us a complimentary Fudge cake slice with a candle on top and an anniversary wish piped with chocolate on the plate. (Remembered too late to take a picture!) Thank God for the tea that made some room for us to gobble the cake down. \n\nThe attentive service at Forty4 is like the icing on the cake! All of this made for a very lovely evening for our family. I am glad we chose to celebrate our special day at Forty4.  :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-07T23:22:53+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-07T23:22:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"711699788","name":"Sanaa Zubairi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1382900598","name":"Sadia Ibrahim"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"691451746","name":"Ayaz Sheikh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjkxNDUxNzQ2","before":"NzExNjk5Nzg4"}}},"restaurantName":"Fish"},{"id":"165861103465048_421403841244105","from":{"name":"??? ?????","id":"514472890"},"message":"The Fish was amazing.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-06T19:45:34+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-07T08:04:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"557540354","name":"Maliha Ehtram"},{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2","before":"NTE4MzA4MDg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"421491134568709","from":{"name":"Danyal Achria","id":"582960575"},"message":"This is Lemon Butter Fish","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-07T01:10:33+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"421493331235156","from":{"name":"Imran Ahmad","id":"622340233"},"message":"Where abouts?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-07T01:19:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"421493984568424","from":{"name":"Danyal Achria","id":"582960575"},"message":"Imran Ahmad The Patio is on the same road as Cafe Flo but further down towards the Kuwaiti Consulate.

Both were really good, I like the Chilli Prawns better. For the Main Course I ordered Chicken & Jalapeno pasta which I loved. For dessert we ordered Creme Brulee which was really odd. It looked really different from any Creme Brulee ive had and the Caramelized layer was way toooooo thick...like fat sheets of hard candy and a little burnt...sticky situation for the teeth, not attractive plus I forgot my hammer at home, usually I keep it in my purse...my luck!\n\nThe service was good and the waitstaff very courteous. But one thing they must change is the music...what is up with a place done up the way Saffron is but playing Lady Gaga & Beyonce's Telephone, Shakira's Waka Waka, Justin Bieber's whatever it is that he sings and 1 more that I cant remember and all ON REPEAT!?! I mean some nice chill beats with maybe a little Talvin Singh type stuff thrown in would've completed the audio visual...it really threw me off, the audio & the visual going together is so important for a restaurant's ambiance I believe but then again I also believed that miniature unicorns existed when I was a kid, I knew the normal size ones were obviously a myth...so anyway, what do I know.\n\nAnyhow, moving on along a decent experience, would go back to try other stuff on the menu. I did notice that all their ingredients were pretty fresh...Ive learned that to judge a restaurant's food quality here in Karachi or maybe in all of Pakistan..one of the things you can look for is how fresh the iceberg lettuce is, and it was pretty darn fresh for that late in the day so that was a definite PLUS! They were right on with the fresh ingredients.\n\nOH YEH! Almost forgot....one last thing if you own this place, you might want to tell your waitstaff that when they bring out the pepper mill for your pasta or anything of that sort, they might want to hold it closer to the plate and not a couple of feet off the plate in the air, the fans and ACs were on pretty high and pepper loves getting in your nose. Something about pepper and noses, they never could get along...eyes are also with the noses on this one.\n\nAnyway, the place is nice and I can see a lot of effort has been put into designing it so that's it, im gonna go finish my pasta that I got parceled...yummmmmm  :D","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-25T22:28:38+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-27T15:15:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"714115614","name":"Nefer Sehgal"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"643423090","name":"Junaid Zuberi"},{"id":"511487130","name":"Beenish Barlas"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"752330337","name":"Faiz Kazi"},{"id":"515674780","name":"Ali Raza Pir"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"},{"id":"502637248","name":"Ather Ul Islam"},{"id":"527710365","name":"Hira Tareen"},{"id":"788400499","name":"Rehman Aziz"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz","before":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"416929561691533","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Waiasay ajj kal Qawaali laggi honi chaiyay herr jagah :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-25T22:32:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417043231680166","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Zara....welcome and am loving the review. \n\nYou went to Dinner WITHOUT ME!!!!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-26T05:33:36+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417059078345248","from":{"name":"Bilal Alvi","id":"641495625"},"message":"ahahahahahahaha! i loved the review! made me laugh out loud \u003dD","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-26T06:51:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417164155001407","from":{"name":"Saira Faruqi","id":"521702664"},"message":"That was fun reading :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-26T14:54:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417429431641546","from":{"name":"Aves Cochinwala","id":"100000661921576"},"message":"Tsk, tsk Lady , u got it  all wrong .

In awe of your superb lunch deals that we tried today, and sad because we did not try them earlier!! \n\nThe three course lunch deals with mocktails at Rs 644 + tax are actually too good to be true. Although I wanted to sample some of the strongly SWOT-recommended entrees, one glance at the deals, and I decided we were all going for them. And am I glad that we did! \n\nNot only was the food scrumptious to the core, the portions were more than ample. (we were quite skeptical about the portion sizes.) I took the Seafood deal and Irfan opted for the Beef deal while our daughters shared the Pasta deal. \n\nSo here's what came to our table: \nStarters: \n  Hot & Sour Soup: tangy, fragrant and flavourful. Loved it!\n  Som Tam (papaya salad): fresh, crunchy and fiery. just as I like it!\n  Chilli Honey Glazed Wings: the quantity (five wings) was impressive, taste was a little ketchup-y but it fared well with the girls. \n\nEntrees:\n   Wok Fried Beef with basil chilli oyster sauce served with steamed rice: Verrry generous portion, scrumptious, a tad bit less flavourful than Fuchsia's. \n   Tamarind Chilli Fish with Basil served with rice: Thank God for the separately served tamarind sauce!! The lightly battered fish was very crisp and did not turn soggy as it usually does after being doused with the sauce. \n   Fettuccine Alfredo: Looked awesome. and the girls polished it off! \n\nDesserts:\n   Bread & butter pudding with ice cream: ohmygodthatwastoogood!! I am definitely going to be dreaming about it for days to come!\n   Chocolate Molten Lava Cake served with ice cream: The chocolate was not strong enough, although the cake was very moist. Ice cream was awfully crystallized. \n\nDrinks:\n   Pina Colada, Lemon Margarita, and Fresh Lime with 7-up: All good!\n\nNeedless to say, we were stuffed beyond imagination! The place is lovely and very pleasant. The seating is highly comfortable. The outdoor patio is such a romantic spot. :)\nThe servers were very courteous and prompt. However, somehow our server was not knowledgeable enough about the lunch deals. He missed our drinks totally and was kind of puzzled when we asked about them. So the drinks arrived after we were done with our main course. But this was the only hiccup in our otherwise absolutely fantastic dining experience.

The biryanee was so over spiced, it literally burnt my taste buds. And the food wasn't cheap for a roadside dhaabaa. Infact it was an insult to our cuisine. I like to support small restaurants too.

Our reservation was for 2:15pm. 5 of us reached on time and ordered the starters and soups. 4 of us were so called detained (by their kids) and reached around 2:50pm. The manager made such a big hue and cry in an elevated voice that why people at our table had not turned up? I was so offended and wanted to leave that instant but my friends calmed me down and found it too inconvenient to change locations as the rest of my friends were on the way. I admit we were partially at fault but this kind of treatment for higher turnovers is unacceptable. People sit and smoke at tables, chat etc when they finish their meals. The whole idea is to enjoy the day/night out and NOT stuff our mouths and leave so the next lot can do the same. Oh and the food was nothing to write home about. The atmosphere was poor; it was too loud, waiters bumped into our chairs and the rude manager gave us the eyeball.\n\nSecond experience\nLiving in Khi we dont give up easy. So I was craving chinese and my hubby wanted to try out somewhere new than our usual. So I said ok lets give Ginsoy another chance; but lets order in this time. Luck has it, they messed up my order I paid for Crispy(rubber textured) Prawns and they crispy (rubber) delivered Fish. When I called them up to complain they dint make it easy for me. When I asked them to deliver my prawns they mentioned it atleast 5 times not to touch the fish and return it as if we couldnt be trusted!! The delivery guy asked us to show us both so he was sure that we were not wrong! And when he saw no tails on the fish he left. I wish I had just handed him both and told him to getlost. \n It was so humilliating and I am so pissed! And boy was I dissapointed with the doughy rubbery prawns they delivered. \nThis restaurant really needs to get their act together.\n\nNEVER AGAIN","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T17:49:10+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-15T17:45:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"611720320","name":"Quratulaien Tanveer"},{"id":"809891464","name":"Julie Haris"},{"id":"681575742","name":"Samreen Sistanwala"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"515193342","name":"Mesam Akhter"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"501356389","name":"Ammara Haque"},{"id":"507428445","name":"Yasir Khan"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA5ODQwOTE3MQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NjExNzIwMzIw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397403113644178","from":{"name":"Bisma Patel","id":"877870480"},"message":"My first and last experience at Ginsoy was not good, either.

I went. Bang on service, anticipatory service... (read attentive and watchful). Starters, I left to Aman Virji. Trio of seafood. Juicy shrimps in a spicy fresh dip, sea bream and smoked salmon. Very very good. The Vietnamese roll was fresh, crunchy, peanuty, spicy and brilliant. The mango prawn salad. The birds eye chilli wafer thin slices hit the perfect high notes. \n\nMy chocolate steak. Very good, but I really only like American steaks, the cut does nothing for me. The wok fried oriental chicken is a must have. The tamarind fish... brill. The pasta 44 was the best of the best. Fish batter was a bit bouncy. But forgiveable.\n\n44 in a nutshell is a very refined place for sophisticated and learning palates. It does stand alone and is an unrecognised under dog who can punch with the best. Service is brilliant, but heck, they new I was coming and rolled out a red and gilt edged carpet for me. I had a great time. 44 is not cheap, but on every plate you know the quality shows they do not skimp. Lastly.... if you have one thing.... Try the 44 house pasta, brilliant.

The chilli garlic prawn was exactly how it sounded, safe and boring, I ordered it in case all else failed with the starters..I had to search around for the prawns..wasn't too impressed with the portions. I went straight into the main course from there which in my case was the beef tenderloin with dark cocoa balsamic reduction in tarragon..was happy to see some one finallyyyyy taking risks and getting adventurous with steaks, preparing them in a different way. I really liked it, although was a bit peeved by the fact that I specifically asked for medium well and what was served was welldone. This is always a problem with restaurants they just can't seem to get it right, my friend ordered te beef tenderloin in Chardonnay..in his case the beef was cooked perfectly but I wasn't too excited about the sauce. I happened to try the angel hair pasta with mussels, scallops and squid. I have to say this dish was prepared very well, it was light and the favors blended perfectly, I would go back there for this dish in particular. The dessert I ordered was the chocolate fondant, was impressed by the very thin film of cake around the lava, something which is missing in the one at pompei which actually feels like a solid sponge cake another thing that was lacking was the burnt caramel ice cream that u get at Pompei. Did not like the vanilla dollop on the side which if I'm not mistaken was not made in the kitchen but most likely bought from the market. \n\nThe service: aahh the service, I'm guessing it would have been better if the majority of the waitier force was not at Adnans table..sorry dude but they were :) ..I happened to get a table in the non smoking section. BAD idea!! Everytime the kitchen door swung open it was like a bar fight in there! Not a pleasant experience! I think I had to wait way too long for my meal, I got there at 935 left at 1145. Had to get the waiters attention more then once. \nAll in all Id have to say I did enjoy the food I ordered, and the fact that it was nice to see someone taking risks with the way food is ordinarily prepared in most restaurants.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T20:19:38+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"395859890465167","from":{"name":"Omar Omari","id":"508277151"},"message":"I apologize if my review was erratic and all over the place, but i am kinda sleepy","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T20:21:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"395864000464756","from":{"name":"Omar Omari","id":"508277151"},"message":"The 44 house pasta was extremely rich..I was floored with one mouthful..heavy stuff but I agree, was flavorful","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T20:29:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"395900820461074","from":{"name":"Omar Omari","id":"508277151"},"message":"True say..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T21:46:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"395902853794204","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"whether fore warned or not - its proves that they can serve that level - so why not to every customer - i am not talking about just 44 here - but generally - why do patrons have to drop names of owners or now  food pages to get decent service - why not everyone who is walking in and going to pay for the the food in front of them","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-10T21:51:10+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"396090333775456","from":{"name":"Sohail Maskatiya","id":"738981577"},"message":"A brief description of the 44 house pasta would be appreciated.

We were served the refreshing Log Inn special drink in miniatures glasses which was very refreshing. For starters we had Chicken strips which were delicious and crispy accompanied with dip, these were served complimentary as Najmul Quddusi was kind enough to extend the urbanite complimentary starters offer for four of us, in dine also.  As discussed with him, urbanite is a fine addition for restaurants who did not have a delivery system of their own, earlier and whose customers would like to order in deliveries. For the main course I had fried Fish as recommended, was apprehensive initially, when the dish was placed before me and I had my first morsel all the fears vanished, it was perfectly fresh, tender, juicy and great taste served with tarter sauce and lemon. Had the Log Inn Beef Cheese Burger, Crispy Chicken Burger, Penne Pasta and Fettuccine paste for the kids. Everything was fresh and served hot, burgers tasted great and fries were crisp.\nThank you Najam sahib was the warm hospitality extended me and my family.

As u might have read and observed, a few individuals r quite upset about their dining experience since feb/march. What our patrons actually experienced at that time was a 8 course meal when we first opened at rs1800 per head with 5 entrees at least. That on its own is great value. They were  never forced, alternate and cheaper set menus were always available. Subsequently, when the ala carte came through, we made sure to check our prices again due to customer complaints - but none of the dishes prices  were changed on an individual basis and we have manage to get an avg per head at rs1200. Duck is extra - its a premium imported meat in karachi. I acknowledge there was a one off bad experience when China kitchen was surprise swotted but that should not have individuals poking at the restaurant and it's potential customers on every positive post that comes through. Thats just sad and its like a kick in the stomach every time. I am glad that you have enjoyed your meal again and I hope that China Kitchen will continue to keep it's standards up to your mark. Standby for some new dishes to be introduced in June and enjoy the fantastic lunch specials :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-25T04:38:27+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"385742574810232","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"I stand by your vision.

I was a part of that group but I never wrote anything about my experience. Yet, I have been following most posts on it and I have seen a clear perception change. Most people are having great experiences there now and happily reporting about it. I still haven't given CK another shot, perhaps because I sensed a lack of interest on the part of owners/ management in acknowledging that they goofed up that day and couldn't care less.. and this wasn't just through notes on SWOT.. This was a first-hand experience. Anyways, the point of this post is that you just need a few words and goodwill gestures to nullify a customer's bad experience. That ugly episode and the ensuing ill-will could have been avoided if CK accepted then and there that they messed up rather than insinuating that some of us had a hidden agenda.

Taking into account the sort of reviews this place is getting, you either love the place or hate it. I for one loved it. I have come back to Patio  after a good 2/3 years and this place has certainly transformed. I was quite unimpressed with my last and only visit it and rated the place as quite mediocre. It is very very different now. \n\nThe decor has certainly improved, making the place look much more alive, modern and cozy. The service was prompt and friendly with the waiters seeming quite informed. I tried the Tapas Platter and Cheese Fondue for starters. I did not like the Cheese Fondue but loved the (baked?) mushrooms and Wasabi Pineapple Prawns. The prawns had a very interesting flavoring, the mixture of wasabi and pineapple did wonders to it. Highly recommended to be ordered on their own. \n\nFor the main course I ended up ordering the Tokyo Fish, apparently it is one of their signature dishes. It is Penguasis fish, batter fried. Crispy from the outside and very delicate from the inside. It is accompanied by garlic fried rice and spinach. Simply superb.\n\nFor the dessert I had Choco-bans which were just brilliant. Spring roll like concoction which are stuffed with bananas. They too were really really good. \n\nThough there is certainly room for improvement as my friends who ordered Mutton Maas were not really impressed with it. One even remarked that the portions were small. These are the areas that ought to be looked at. But overall a great experience. I personally see a good future for this place if they fine tune it a little more.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T20:06:38+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372078126176677","from":{"name":"Shaikh Fawad","id":"694238742"},"message":"started it all w/ the Cheese Fondue which was a very gud start, rich, but not too heavy, & not at all processed:))) the array of Tapas\u003cmentioned above\u003e were really gr8too\u003clight, tasty, wonderfully flavorful, in other words subtle, but sexy:\u003e....steak au gratin (medium) was the best dish on the table\u003cstaff was attentive, i improvised my steak w/ finely chopped ginger, really enhances the flavors:\u003e, done to perfection, and generous enough to feed the whole table:D, and the Peanut butter mousse\u003cin a deliciously edible chocolate cup:\u003e &Naughty Toffee were the perfect end to an already gr8 evening.....gud work PATIO!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T20:51:43+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372093282841828","from":{"name":"Asghar Khan","id":"100001971572016"},"message":"1250 per head with drinks and water + tips +tax can you break dawn just for information...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T21:20:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372107876173702","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"the total bill was 9005 - we rounded it to a even 1250 per person. just easy math.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T21:48:31+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372219232829233","from":{"name":"Danyal Achria","id":"582960575"},"message":"Faisal Naseer & Shaikh Fawad Thanks a lot for the review.

It was average at best. Realized after seeing it that one should not go for desi at a place like The Patio, so obviously it was more of a wrong choice made (If I wanted desi, I should've just listened to Sarah J.K and ordered the BBQ Platter). Having said the cheese fondue I felt was extremely good and not at all too cheesy :P. The Tapas platters like everyone else mentioned were brilliant. The desserts were out of this world, even though the raving reviews for the naughty toffee, i felt the peanut butter oreo mousse was even better. It was to my liking sweeeeeeetness galore, the naughty toffee wasn't as sweet as this. So I guess for people who don't have too much of a sweet tooth the toffee will do. Service was one of if not the best at any restaurant. If ever one needed anything, you'd look up and the server would be right there, Top notch stuff. Another thing a couple of us thought were that the portions were a bit small, but keeping the per head cost in mind afterwards, didn't seem as bad.

This new kid on the block needs lot of time to reach the required level. The area is not really ideal for sitting outdoors so opted for sitting in the car, no proper lighting and seating as it was too sandy. The order was taken promptly but it took twenty minutes to serve it. Fish and Chips was thin and the fish was bland and lacked body, seemed like frozen fillet's fried and served instead of fresh fish, no tarter sauce only chatni. Malai Fish Tikka was good served on four skewers and Fish fillet grilled was ok, thin slice of fillet, masala was more on the surface and didn't sink in. We asked what happened to the bread rolls but they didn't have them so a guy was seen rushing on his motorbike to fetch them and even the ones he managed to get were not fresh, lemon provided was like rock and needed a ton of pressure to yield a few drops. Met the owner a young man who ably dealt with a situation that happened their with some people who should not have been their in the first place, anyways value for money its 5/10,quality of food its 6/10, service is slack and no one asked us after we were served if we required anything. They need to work hard and diversify their menu, no rice, only 38 items on their menu. A lot needs to be done to improve by leaps and bounds starting with the whole ambience of the place.Prices versus value for money, were not competitive. I hope this critique is taken positively and helps the place to improve as a lot is lacking and can be improved upon considering that the location is fantastic with Village on one side and Cineplex right behind, this can yield benefits if measures are taken for improvement.Goodluck!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-01T22:27:39+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-02T14:48:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"726690443","name":"Danial Rizvi"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"1473681227","name":"Shabnam Jabbar"},{"id":"100001822097920","name":"Sara Kazmi"},{"id":"543405800","name":"Tahir Wahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNDA1ODAw","before":"MTAwMDAyOTY3NTA0MTU5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"371123056272184","from":{"name":"Saira Qadri","id":"609681937"},"message":"rock and needed a ton of pressure to yield a few drops.......lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-02T10:43:02+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"371184869599336","from":{"name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi","id":"1198831376"},"message":"Lol ....

when the SWOTTIES and The SWOTS ( Zoya Khan & Nezihe Hussain ) actually arrived at CHINA KITCHEN\n\nAbid Aziz Merchant, Aalia Mahboob Elahi, Irfan Ismail, Hussain Tariq, Saba Hussain, Mahvash Siddiqi Khan, Aamir Basrai (9 of us at one table)\n\nthe other table i have added too.\n\n1st - recap from the first episode - i booked on MONDAY 16th - and promptly was send an email with 3 fixed menu options and NO where does it say that EACH TABLE was to choose the fixed menu. when you have a fixed menu/ per head - its understood that its for EACH person. anyway they had asked that the choices be sent in at 12noon of the day we had our reseervations - i replied to them at 1230 am (12 hours prior to the deadline - along with the dietary requirements - on our arrival - it was obvious that they had NO clue - since they had not bothered to check that email - this they accepted and offered to do something - but in all honesty NOTHING was done - thu they were of course very polite (20 SWOTTIES) - kinda have to be polite.\n\n2nd - the crab wontons that arrived - 4 plates with 4 peices each - for 9 at our table - i dont get the math here. thu very nice - not something i would be going back for\n\n3rd - 'hot & sour\" soup - was sour black bean tofu soup - there was NOTHING hot there neither the temperature nor the chili - i am used to desi Hot and Sour, from NYC China town, SFO china town,  London (ping pong, memories of london and Mr. Wing) - this soup was NOT acceptable - Karachi Yuang Tung and Dynasty does a much better job. so NOT going back for that\n\n4th - the deep fried squid - was cooked to perfection - and quite palatable  \n\n5th - the rice (was cold and dry) and NOT brown as per our requirements - white soaked in soya is not brown rice\n\n6th - all the meats that arrived were at best luke warm - chicken was actually raw, fish was stale.\n\n7th - the stir fry veggies - a lovely medley of mushrooms, black fungus, beans, cauliflower, lightly cooked and crunchy and steaming - but would i go back for just that?\n\n8th - ice cream - claimed to be HOME-MADE was NOT - it crystallized refrozen and then melted mess in a bowl - they should have opened a can of lychees and served that one ice!!!\n\nafter getting such rave reviews - i am seriously questioning all those who did - but i have to admit - the one person whom i have grown to trust - had warned me - and i know why i adore him and trust him so much.\n\nas before i will reiterate that everyone's experience is going to be different each time - this is not a personal attack - just that i was seriously expecting something great and was horribly let down - and broke now too - in the middle of the month.\n\nI PRAY THEY TRY AND IMPROVE - AND BECOME AS GOOD AS MOST OF THEIR FRIENDS HAVE CLAIMED THEY ARE.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-19T20:09:26+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-20T05:22:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"804492481","name":"Faisal Hassan"},{"id":"724851212","name":"Mahvash Siddiqi"},{"id":"585622689","name":"Naveed Ismail"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMDE0NDc1NjIw","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"299568130094344","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"oh yeah forgot -

I'm sure most of the members here are familiar with the term, ?crabbing? and know that in karachi it (crabbing) revolves around, not the act of fishing for crabs in the sea, but just feasting on them. Captain Saleem, the man, or should I say his \"venture\", needs no introduction (because now it?s more like a pvt. Ltd company; he should seriously consider registering it at the kse), was our ?Kaptaan?. To cut to the chase, he did a fantastic job last night. The chutney was phenomenal. His team never fails to impress me. Every time I've opted for another kaptaan, I have been disappointed?to the point where I have been reprimanded by my friends for making the evening uncomfortable by going on and on about how captain saleems food tastes SO much better than his rivals. The point is, don't waste your evening in another kaptaans boat if you want to enjoy the real crabbing experience, saleem will never disappoint you and will never fail to surprise you with new crab-concoctions each time you hire him. Ask Saleem to serve boiled claws. I tried them for the first time last night. They were delicious. I still love my masala ones but this was a pleasant change. Enjoy a crab-splurge, its worth it; especially in this weather!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-12T06:19:27+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-12T13:03:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"502442918","name":"Rabeea Ishtiaq"},{"id":"596505603","name":"Shehryar Rauf Baig"},{"id":"500472749","name":"Aurangzeb 'pinks' Siddiqui"},{"id":"521690093","name":"Louie Sh"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"586043191","name":"Mustafa Mohomedally"},{"id":"509507958","name":"Omair Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5NTA3OTU4","before":"NTAyNDQyOTE4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"294801580570999","from":{"name":"Syed Adil Ahmed","id":"669175907"},"message":"Saleem is the man...no doubt about it","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-12T06:27:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"294805853903905","from":{"name":"Javaria Javed","id":"1640895663"},"message":"Not just the Chutney but everythinmg he provides is amazing..Capt Saleem....quite favourite and popular amongst crabbing lovers....agreed with Mr.Adl and Farah Qadri...he's the man!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-12T06:42:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"514058187","name":"Farah Qadri","type":"user","offset":154,"length":11}]},{"id":"294806617237162","from":{"name":"Ahmed Shahnawaz","id":"100000759794024"},"message":"i prefer captain bilal dunno why","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-12T06:44:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"294807997237024","from":{"name":"Afroza Bhamani","id":"846664538"},"message":"Please let me know the number and the charges; would really appreciate it","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-12T06:51:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"294808960570261","from":{"name":"Kamran Hasan","id":"777233042"},"message":"also let me no the the no and charges","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-12T06:55:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"294810267236797","from":{"name":"Farah Qadri","id":"514058187"},"message":"Capt.

I do not think I'd be ordering from them any time soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-16T15:44:32+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-17T07:05:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100000578236531","name":"Naheed Asim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNTc4MjM2NTMx","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"278913335493157","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"I ordered from there last week.

Ordered the starter of the Charcoal Platter consisting of fried chicken slices with cheese, fish fingers, chicken wings & deep fried button mushrooms served with 4 dippers. That plate was emptied within mintues by 3 adults & 3 kids - verdict - yummy n felt like ordering more!\n\nMain courses:\n\n1) Mushroom Steak with mashed potatoes - It was beef, juicy and well done, served withg fantastic taste of mashied potatoes.\n\n2) Fish & Chip - 2 slices of fish fillets served with salad and fries. Quite a serving that my mom still had 1 sliced left coz she was too full. Served with tartar sauce and a dipper for the fries which was really crispy.\n\n3) Charcoal Mix Platter - enough for 2 - Grilled prawns wz sliced capsicum, small slice of lemon and onion - a lil spicy but not desi :) Steak with sauce, again juicy n yummy. Fish fillet - crispy on the outside but soft in the inside, chicken piece with white sauce - no complain and lastly their awesome mashed potatoes!\n\n4) Popcorn Chicken with fries (kiddy meal) - Big popcorn chicken deep fried just nice, crispy and juice and yummy fries that was served with it with the dipper. Had to order another one coz the elder son didnt want to share! :)\n\nDesserts -\n\n1) Brownie - Big chunk of brownie served in a tall glass, surrounded with yummy ice cream vanilla ice cream, huge portion, can be shared.\n\n2) Chocolate Mousse - smooth and chocolatey at the right amount.\n\n3) Cheesecake with caramel - Delish and with the caramel on top it added just the right amount of sweetness to it,just perfect to end our evening by the sea.\n\nGreat service, ambiance and definitely worth a visit. Will put up some photos soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-17T04:19:31+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-17T04:51:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"610590030","name":"Najam Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjEwNTkwMDMw","before":"MTA5ODQwOTE3MQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"279249205459570","from":{"name":"Mohsin E Azam","id":"622525326"},"message":"I second that...
