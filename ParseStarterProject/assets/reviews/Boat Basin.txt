The idea was to find a winner amongst these 3, and then further extend the competition.\n\nBefore leaving home (G.Jauhar) I ordered MYOB and asked for their Mushroom Madness, which I was to pick from Boat Basin, since that is their only take-away spot. I reached the decided spot about 10 minutes before the MYOB-rider was to show up. He reached the place on time, and to do justice, I had decided earlier to eat the burger the instant I receive it, just to remove any ambiguities of it getting cold/stale etc. Mushroom Madness was a decent enough burger. I had major issues with it's bun, which made it's duty to annoy me till the very end. The bun kept on breaking and crumbling, and the sauces made it extremely soggy; more like a wet-dipped bread. The burger itself was nice enough, in terms of taste.\n\nNext up was The Burger Factory. My intentions were to try the mushroom-topped burgers of the 3 joints, but knowing that TBF doesn't have one, I opted for Ironman Double. It was again a nice burger, eaten as soon as it was served. The amount of cheese did justice to it's description, and the patty was comparatively MUCH softer than the MYOB patty. The MYOB patty was a bit firm. So till now, MYOB vs. TBF and TBF won.\n\nAnd finally, the last stop (after having a Hazelnut Cappuccino from Espresso) was The Burger Shack. Ordered the Shack Shroom Double, and yes there was a small queue (TBF was deserted). Received the order in 17 minutes or so. Closed my eyes, dug in for the first bite.\n*swoosh*\nI was in an entirely different landscape. With soft buns floating around me, the right amount of mushroom topping, not making the bun go soggy and a pain to deal with. And then my palates detected the first hint of the TBS-beef. Sold. Absolutely sold all over again. I was a TBS-loyal ever since I first had it, but when going out on today's expedition, my aim was to give every place a fair chance, and not be biased. I opened my eyes and the reason for the queue outside TBS everytime I went there was answered by the bite of Shack Shroom in my mouth.\n\nMYOB vs. TBF vs. TBS\nHands down, of these three, The Burger Shack is the winner.\nMy next venture would be to compare The Burger Shack and Burger Inc.\n\nEat on people!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-17T19:01:13+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-20T07:18:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"549030715","name":"Rawfay Ahmed"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"688469251","name":"Azeem Dada"},{"id":"751128592","name":"Talha Rashid"},{"id":"716686563","name":"Maaz Sarfaraz"},{"id":"1072105633","name":"Fatima Zaidi"},{"id":"635810442","name":"Kiran Afzal"},{"id":"514392526","name":"Mahnaz Fahad"},{"id":"827180267","name":"DrJoyo Tabsheer"},{"id":"751030900","name":"Zoha Manzar"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100001640822737","name":"Khadija Jatoi"},{"id":"100003247463950","name":"Murk Mustafa"},{"id":"100000003997863","name":"Adnan Jawed Amin"},{"id":"517317558","name":"Muhammad Jawad"},{"id":"652785155","name":"Marium Asim"},{"id":"640740531","name":"Reshma Chhotani"},{"id":"804995006","name":"Muhammad Naseer"},{"id":"1580010637","name":"Ayesha Ahsan"},{"id":"882650316","name":"Sabah Shaikh"},{"id":"528034021","name":"Sikander Majeed"},{"id":"576731107","name":"Shahzad Nayani"},{"id":"1373776544","name":"Samia Waheed"},{"id":"667017252","name":"Taha Javed"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzI3NzkxMjA1","before":"NTQ5MDMwNzE1"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_668159803235173/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzI3NzkxMjA1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"668223359895484","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Excellent read and great review!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-17T21:48:13+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"668223683228785","from":{"name":"Rabeet Rao","id":"749204552"},"message":"Much obliged ma'am. :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-17T21:48:52+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"668225179895302","from":{"name":"Nabeel Kazi","id":"733018407"},"message":"That is pretty hardcore of you Rabeet.

The access to the place is narrow service lane. The shop has a small frontage and is deep inside. It appears that the shop belongs to someone in Management with vested interest.  As a result the outlet is congested and cramped. Either BK does not expect much clientele of dine in. At the main counter ordered meal deal for Whopper with cheese. During placing of order which was quick but observed that confusion prevails in the area. \nThe taste of Whopper was good but fries reminded me of Mojeebs near Jheel Park (no more there anymore). We sat down on sofa which were comfortable but the table was small and not enough to handle one tray. \nOn top of it,  the height of the table upto your face if you want to sit in the comfortable sofa. Could not fully enjoy the taste of burger due to ill planned furniture. \nThe crampness of the place and discomfort due to furniture gave the same feeling when having seekh kababs at Waheed Restaurant on Burns Road.\nWent to the washroom to assess the admin strength and capabilities. Total failure despite a new innovative cement washbasin. Due to poor flooring the water oozing out of muslim shower accumulated in front of the door making the shoes wet. There was no supervisor card to show when the washroom was checked. The wc was dirty and almost running out of toilet paper roll.    \nPoor brand management of a great brand.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-23T21:39:52+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-23T23:56:36+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1109359970","name":"Altaf Suleman"},{"id":"759025230","name":"Hassan Jan"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"531760529","name":"Neha Sarwar"},{"id":"612464159","name":"Zainab Atif Kabir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjEyNDY0MTU5","before":"MTEwOTM1OTk3MA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"656364954414658","from":{"name":"Umer Rashid","id":"849920390"},"message":"I just miss chicken jumbo burger of Mojeebs","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-23T23:56:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjU2MzY0OTU0NDE0NjU4","before":"NjU2MzY0OTU0NDE0NjU4"}}},"restaurantName":"Boat Basin"},{"id":"165861103465048_655417271176093","from":{"name":"Najia Ahmed","id":"819424477"},"message":"Craving for nice qeema paratha ..

However, kitchen was in bad shape. Food was cold, the Espetada was completely tasteless and needed serious dipping in Nandos sauce for any taste (even salt). This isn't the first time I've been to the Boat Basin outlet and gotten cold food. It seems they just cannot handle large crowds.

There was ?HAIR? in one of our chicken steak meal, which was really apparent. And all the manager did was he just replaced that dish with the new one, with no words of regrets or disappointment, there was no form of compensation at all. Manager?s Name was Jawaid at Sindhi Muslim Society. He was so rude to even accept the mistake. Is this how they are supposed to serve their customers? How shameful it is to serve such quality of food. Aren?t they supposed to check the meal before they serve? I?m sorry but I dnt think, I will ever go to that branch again. I regret taking our guests there. Nandos should improve their standards before it?s too late and they need to guide their managers about customer dealing and improving customer?s trustworthiness. Extremely disappointed...","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-02T10:51:45+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-04T05:23:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"557216100","name":"Vikki Mohsin"},{"id":"521420389","name":"Syed Jami Amin"},{"id":"517589528","name":"Ayesha Sheikh"},{"id":"100003495204029","name":"Noman Faysal"},{"id":"100001039943363","name":"Munawar M Shahid"},{"id":"692921639","name":"Alifya Taha Terwari"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjkyOTIxNjM5","before":"ODg0MTA1MTky"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"532458686805286","from":{"name":"Ammar Habib Khan","id":"685505866"},"message":"Nandos Pakistan","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-02T19:42:35+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100000605305028","name":"Nandos Pakistan","type":"user","offset":0,"length":15}]},{"id":"532765210107967","from":{"name":"Bilal Pervaiz","id":"502380214"},"message":"i dont understand lahore nandos is doing wonders its always full","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-03T07:59:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"532781333439688","from":{"name":"Vikki Mohsin","id":"557216100"},"message":"I guess karachites have raised their standards about food ....
