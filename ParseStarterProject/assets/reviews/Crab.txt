At the time of reservation, apprehension had engulfed me...I kept hoping and praying I had made the correct decision by opting for HLS, having read the \"brilliant\" feedback from Swotties and bloggers on various food pages\n\n1. The serving staff were really helpful & patient with the suggestions/recommendations, & detailed explanations of what each dish (the ones we asked about) on the menu were like.That not only helped us order the correct dishes, but also made us feel at home.\n\n2. For appetizers we ordered the seafood chowder (soup), cream of asparagus and roasted tomato & basil soup. \nThe highlight was the seafood chowder that tasted like nothing else on this planet! Don't have words to explain how much it was busting with flavor...It was love at the very first bite, for each and every one of us!\nThe remaining 2 soups tasted really really good too!\n\n2. Ordered the following for Main Course:\n\n* Seafood Kata Kat (something totally different, and a must for every seafood lover)\n* Prawn Masala (deliciousness personified)\n* Crabs Subzwari (to die for)\n* Grilled Red Snapper with chilli sauce (bohot aala!!)\n*Chicken Tornados (wow)\n\nAmbience & Service: Delightful\nFood Taste & Quality: Unparalleled to any other seafood in town. Absolutely Divine!\n\nMinuses: Food is irresistible & highly addictive\n\nMr. Haroon Leghari You really got all of us HOOKED! Thank you for such a wonderful experience & many more to follow In Sha Allah!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-23T23:57:46+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-24T10:41:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100006717730226","name":"Cafeela Authorities"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"1776679200","name":"Khurram Jamal"},{"id":"1553621640","name":"Lybha Nadeem"},{"id":"100001640822737","name":"Khadija Jatoi"},{"id":"100001089240373","name":"Abdul Basit Sivany"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"100000059823691","name":"Haroon Leghari"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"1023534896","name":"Uzma Merchant"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTc1Mjc2NzUy","before":"MTAwMDA2NzE3NzMwMjI2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"656540207730466","from":{"name":"Haroon Leghari","id":"100000059823691"},"message":"Thank you so much Shumyla ...delighted you had a great experience!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-24T10:41:15+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjU2NTQwMjA3NzMwNDY2","before":"NjU2NTQwMjA3NzMwNDY2"}}},"restaurantName":"Crab"},{"id":"165861103465048_654498037934683","from":{"name":"Arif Maniar","id":"548327054"},"message":"Can't wait till Taco Bell or Del Taco will come to Pakistan.

Lil difficult to find the place as it is without any signage. Ordered Chilli Garlic Prawns, Grilled Calamari, Avacado Prawns, Smoked Salmon, Seafood Chowder, Prawn Masala from Kerala, Crab Grattin, Grilled Red Snapper with Pepperonata, Grilled Seabass and Blue Cheese Steak. Also had fresh Watermelon :) Food was very very nice and presentation was extremely good with few exceptions.....Grilled Calamari and Avacado Prawns....didn't like both. Servers were very well trained. Only other problems i noted were that since the restaurant is established in Swiss Cottages, the kitchen does not have a separate access like China Kitchen hence everything moving in/out has to pass through the service area where guests are housed and although the food quality and taste was beyond imagination...there were not many guests. I mean we were the only people there. This is probably one reason that they are closing down for lunch wef 10th June and now they will be only open for lunch on weekends. I would give food 9/10, service 8/10 and ambience 7/10. My favorites were Crab Grattin, Grilled Seabass and Grilled Red Snapper! Will sure recommend seafood lovers and I will definnitelyyyyy go again!!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-09T13:32:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-09T14:23:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1460223238","name":"Sadia Amjad"},{"id":"1505127873","name":"Moazzam Ahmed Amin"},{"id":"556372046","name":"Ammara Shariq"},{"id":"509568517","name":"Beenish Ehsan"},{"id":"647940246","name":"Maheen Khan Omair"},{"id":"666536302","name":"Momina Ahmad"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE2OTk1NDIx","before":"MTQ2MDIyMzIzOA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"569032789814542","from":{"name":"Haider Zaidi","id":"687255482"},"message":"Haroon Leghari","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T14:23:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100000059823691","name":"Haroon Leghari","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]},{"id":"569032853147869","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Ahmad","id":"536832784"},"message":"Good objective review.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-09T14:23:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTY5MDMyODUzMTQ3ODY5","before":"NTY5MDMyNzg5ODE0NTQy"}}},"restaurantName":"Crab"},{"id":"165861103465048_568559923195162","from":{"name":"Haroon Leghari","id":"100000059823691"},"message":"Tonight Saturday there is live Jazz at HLS.

Nezihe Hussain I like the \"Think before you SWOT\" rules and it is great to find pages like yours that promote Karachi and it's restaurants.  I live in North America and nothing like the restaurants in Karachi are present here.  In fact Indian and Pakistani restaurants have a bad name here for dirt and unhygienic methods.  It is with great joy when I found a review on one the restaurants in Karachi so I hope you do not mind if I place it here.  Keep up the great work!!  \n\nThis review was done by someone named: Azam Sultan Ahmed:\n\nLet me warn you this is going to be a long review, so be prepared. This evening I visited Thyme restaurant which is tucked away on 1st Commercial Lane Zamzama for a meal. The first impression when you enter the restaurant is of a homely and artistically done up place with plenty of paintings, it is a cozy and manageable place with capacity for seating 30 diners on the 1st floor. It was a pleasure meeting Mr. Haider Ghulam a seasoned professional, an upright and hard working young man who has 22 years of practical experience under his belt both here as well as abroad, he along with his brothers and a dedicated team have run the place very efficiently for the last six years. Like all restauranteurs Thyme has weathered the storms but never given up and continues to face challenges even today but Haider and his team face them with courage and bravery. Haider has started from grass root level and has a varied experience which helps him to understand the business better than others. \n\nFirst we were served a warm bread plate with butter and garlic in sauce. Starters were grilled calamari garnished with basil leaves, a heavenly zesty sauce and Stuffed Mushrooms with Crab Meat, both the starters were simply divine and tasted excellent. \n\nMain Course I had Tuscany Roast Fillet of Beef with Blue Cheese sauce served with Risotto and shaved Parmesan, medium well, the meat was tender, juicy and well flavored, my better half had Chicken with creamy green peppercorn mustard and fresh herb sauce, the fusion of herbs and peppercorn made the flavor a class of its own.This was accompanied with plain rice and sauteed veggies.\n\nFinally by the time desert came we were quite full, this was a surprise as we were not told what it would be, it was the all time favorite Bread pudding and as Haider described that the Bread Pudding makes space for itself, now this was innovation at its best, the bread pudding had a scoop of ice cream sitting on top of it and was served warm, freshly made and very tender, wow, seeing is believing, words cannot describe this desert and below the bread pudding was a generous amount of sweet toffee sauce which was a complete food coma for desert lovers\n\nThyme restaurant i am compelled to give you a 10/10, you have passed on all counts, service, quality, quantity, flavor, presentation,ambiance. I knew i was forgetting something, the choice of music was superb with some old tracks which were soothing. Thyme is a great place for ladies lunches, corporate meetings or GT's, it is highly recommended, plus they do outdoor catering for small and large groups and even cook at your house for small GT's and come with their stuff and clean up your place before leaving, so logistically they are spot on. Well done Haider Ghulam and the team Thyme, you guys rock, i feel proud that we have people who are hard working, dedicated and enthusiastic about your job as you in Pakistan. Continue like this in future and you will become even more successful. Thank you Haider and team Thyme, well done!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-16T23:12:36+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-18T03:52:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"698885102","name":"Aamir Ghaffar"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz","before":"Njk4ODg1MTAy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"474221045962384","from":{"name":"Dona Nazareth Andrew","id":"669132323"},"message":"thanks for liking this review Syed Ali Raza Abidi have you gone to eat here would love to get your opinion too","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-18T00:07:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"474287899289032","from":{"name":"Shoaib Taimur","id":"687580830"},"message":"I have been to Thyme once. loved it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-18T03:52:20+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDc0Mjg3ODk5Mjg5MDMy","before":"NDc0MjIxMDQ1OTYyMzg0"}}},"restaurantName":"Crab"},{"id":"165861103465048_473825596001929","from":{"name":"Fatz Syed","id":"502055652"},"message":"- Went to China Kitchen after ages!!!

I hardly get the opportunity to complain about the food.  Maybe once or twice but that was a long time ago.  Today however was another matter.  We were the only one's when we arrived so looked forward to total attention.  We visited for lunch at 1 p.m. and though the service was as excellent apart from the waiter not showing us the Special's board and expected us to walk around the corner to check it out.  We insisted he take the board off the hooks and bring it around to show it to us.  Not good!.  The food today left a lot to be desired. The bread basket had one type of bread a bit too dry and the other a bit too oily for my pallate.  The Herb butter was too soft and not being given a butter knife was I thought not really up to the mark.  The small vegi tit bits that are rolled out prior to the meal were just that much dryer then they should have been.   My host and myself were not very interested in a starter but decided to share the Scallops with Truffle Oil.  When it arrived it looked awful lying in the plate with such thin slices which probably amounted to one large scallop full stop.  They had a light drizzle of black pepper and did not look very appettizing!.  Then came the belch from me followed by one from my host.  It tasted vile!...we called the manager on duty and asked him to try one too..he took away the plate tried it and then returned initially to say that it tasted fine to him.  When I insisted he rethink his response as it tasted very bad he said it was probably the Truffle Oil being of very strong and pungent texture.  He brought the bottle over and let us smell it.  Yes, it was the Truffle Oil!...it was so strong it blew my nose away and my host's.  We all decided that the only way to add Truffle Oil to the Scallops would be to use just a drop rather then baste it with it.  The two don't work together for me as it stands!.  I had ordered the Red Crab with Garlic and Virgin Olive Oil.  A great dish and looked amazing!...the Red crab just looks so delicious even before you tuck in to it.  The taste was as expected wonderful but ever so slightly over cooked and wee bit dry in some parts.  The garnish was on the stingy side but was adequate because the Crab took center stage.  I noticed as the bread basket neared its end and only the dry bread was left there was no attempt to replenish it or even an offer to the effect.  The waiters were attentive and kept removing the left over crab shells and my host's prawn shells.  By the way my friend had the Spaghetti with Seafood.  He thought the spaghetti seemed a bit more soggy then normal having tried the same dish at one or two earlier occasions!.  The Prawns he said were extremely good.  Some background in the Restaurant might have also helped in the overall ambience!.  The shell crusher didn't get much of a chance to do much but the Crab drawer was a good touch and it helped a great deal in getting in to the nook and crany's of the crab shells.   Then came the dessert.  I ordered the Rasberry and my host the Lemon Sorbet.. both were excellent but little in quantity I thought....on hind sight it was good that it was not too much as it was lunch and ended a mixed bag of experiences at OKRA this lunch time.  I was looking out for Ayaz who I was sure was there when we arrived...I saw his Green BMW outside but when I asked later he had left.

Out of the three drinks on the buffet - Rooh Afza, Lemonade and Tamarind Juice - the Tamarind juice was a winner for me. \n\nThe dinner buffet opened after an interval, and although the offerings were limited in variety, the taste was mind-blowing! Thai Chicken Curry, Beef Medallions in peppercorn sauce, and Fish & Crab Balls in Chinese Sauce were absolutely finger-looking good, and I wished I had held back on the iftar consumption a little to enjoy the dinner entr?es more. The only glitch was that the garlic rice and chowmein took forever to reload and there were long gaps between refills of the rest of the entr?es too, which led people to constantly hover around the buffet. \n\nThe desserts were an absolute delight as well. Chocolate Brownies, Cream caramel, Fudge Cake, chocolate balls, pineapple cake, and fresh fruits just made for a very indulgent end to the meal, and I even forgot about the Hazelnut Dream Cake that awaited us at home. :)\n\nThis, however, was not the end of the meal! Aman Virjee made a lovely gesture of sending us a complimentary Fudge cake slice with a candle on top and an anniversary wish piped with chocolate on the plate. (Remembered too late to take a picture!) Thank God for the tea that made some room for us to gobble the cake down. \n\nThe attentive service at Forty4 is like the icing on the cake! All of this made for a very lovely evening for our family. I am glad we chose to celebrate our special day at Forty4.  :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-07T23:22:53+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-07T23:22:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"711699788","name":"Sanaa Zubairi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1382900598","name":"Sadia Ibrahim"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"691451746","name":"Ayaz Sheikh"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjkxNDUxNzQ2","before":"NzExNjk5Nzg4"}}},"restaurantName":"Crab"},{"id":"165861103465048_421001367951019","from":{"name":"Hanif Bhatti","id":"710596065"},"message":"Carbs anyone..

Both were really good, I like the Chilli Prawns better. For the Main Course I ordered Chicken & Jalapeno pasta which I loved. For dessert we ordered Creme Brulee which was really odd. It looked really different from any Creme Brulee ive had and the Caramelized layer was way toooooo thick...like fat sheets of hard candy and a little burnt...sticky situation for the teeth, not attractive plus I forgot my hammer at home, usually I keep it in my purse...my luck!\n\nThe service was good and the waitstaff very courteous. But one thing they must change is the music...what is up with a place done up the way Saffron is but playing Lady Gaga & Beyonce's Telephone, Shakira's Waka Waka, Justin Bieber's whatever it is that he sings and 1 more that I cant remember and all ON REPEAT!?! I mean some nice chill beats with maybe a little Talvin Singh type stuff thrown in would've completed the audio visual...it really threw me off, the audio & the visual going together is so important for a restaurant's ambiance I believe but then again I also believed that miniature unicorns existed when I was a kid, I knew the normal size ones were obviously a myth...so anyway, what do I know.\n\nAnyhow, moving on along a decent experience, would go back to try other stuff on the menu. I did notice that all their ingredients were pretty fresh...Ive learned that to judge a restaurant's food quality here in Karachi or maybe in all of Pakistan..one of the things you can look for is how fresh the iceberg lettuce is, and it was pretty darn fresh for that late in the day so that was a definite PLUS! They were right on with the fresh ingredients.\n\nOH YEH! Almost forgot....one last thing if you own this place, you might want to tell your waitstaff that when they bring out the pepper mill for your pasta or anything of that sort, they might want to hold it closer to the plate and not a couple of feet off the plate in the air, the fans and ACs were on pretty high and pepper loves getting in your nose. Something about pepper and noses, they never could get along...eyes are also with the noses on this one.\n\nAnyway, the place is nice and I can see a lot of effort has been put into designing it so that's it, im gonna go finish my pasta that I got parceled...yummmmmm  :D","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-25T22:28:38+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-27T15:15:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"714115614","name":"Nefer Sehgal"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"643423090","name":"Junaid Zuberi"},{"id":"511487130","name":"Beenish Barlas"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"752330337","name":"Faiz Kazi"},{"id":"515674780","name":"Ali Raza Pir"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"},{"id":"502637248","name":"Ather Ul Islam"},{"id":"527710365","name":"Hira Tareen"},{"id":"788400499","name":"Rehman Aziz"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz","before":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"416929561691533","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Waiasay ajj kal Qawaali laggi honi chaiyay herr jagah :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-25T22:32:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417043231680166","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Zara....welcome and am loving the review. \n\nYou went to Dinner WITHOUT ME!!!!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-26T05:33:36+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417059078345248","from":{"name":"Bilal Alvi","id":"641495625"},"message":"ahahahahahahaha! i loved the review! made me laugh out loud \u003dD","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-26T06:51:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417164155001407","from":{"name":"Saira Faruqi","id":"521702664"},"message":"That was fun reading :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-26T14:54:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417429431641546","from":{"name":"Aves Cochinwala","id":"100000661921576"},"message":"Tsk, tsk Lady , u got it  all wrong .

WOW what a beautiful place - i am already a fan of your work and was once again loved the way you have created the lovely cozy yet spacious ambiance with 44.\n\nthe staff is courteous and helpful, polite and cheerful - always a good sign.\n\nthe food itself ranged from excellent to alright. first the excellent dishes\n\n1) the chicken mousse and rice cake starter - tiny bite-sized portions - lovely to start off a meal\n2) the bread basket - with a variety of breads - each fresh and very good - i didnt need the garlic butter - it was lovely to nibble of the buttery salty breadstix on their own and the toasted flat bread with flax seeds nice touch.\nall except 1 starter we ordered were on Aman's recommendation and i have decided to let him order for me in future \n3) the sea food trio - with smoked salmon stack, prawn cocktail with a spicy tomato based dip and grilled fish with a avocado salsa - very good - and beautifully presented\n4) The Prawn Gambas - out standing - have already gone into the buttery details of this on the pic - a MUST try for all prawn lovers\n5) THE WOK FRIED CRABS - OMG serious love happening - already apologized to Syed Ali Raza Abidi for this but i think the affair with the Goan Crabs is over for a while.\n6) the Cajun chicken Cesar salad - this is NOT my fav salad to begin with - am not a mayo fan - but from what i sampled - it was fresh and very vibrant in colors and textures - taste was pretty good - but i would never order this anywhere in the world\n\nthen came the entrees - (yes we eat a lot)\n7) Angle Hair pasta with scallops, mussels calamari prawns and fish - garnished with sun dried tomatoes and fresh parsley - the sea food was totally fresh and perfectly cooked, the dish seasoned well - the pasta was a bit over done for my palate but then i know many here who dont like el dente - so it can be quite bothersome for a chef.\n8) the beef tenderloin with tarragon - and chocolate balsamic reduction - was the biggest steak (we estimated it to be about 300 gms - but Aman said it was between 250-275gms) cooked to medium rare (thu unfortunately this was ordered Medium) - the reduction was amazing - smooth and silky, sweet and tangy and perfectly balanced with the char grilled beef and the herbs. if i am not stuffed with the Gambas and the crabs on my next visit - i am ordering this - and i like mt steaks medium rare.\n9) the Chicken and Beef Burgers - both were ok and presented well, one with home fries and one with the most amazing gratin - when there is so much other stuff to try i wont be ordering burgers at a place like 44\n10) the red thai curry with chicken and steamed rice - actually better than Fuchsias\n11) chicken roulade in pesto sauce - the presentation, the sauce and the sides were great - the chicken itself a little dry but definitely something that can be looked into and i would recommend that for all kukur lovers (which thankfully i am NOT)\n\nafter all this food - we had no space for dessert and were going to skip off for some healthy apple tea that Abid Aziz Merchant has brought back from Turkey but Aman wont hear of that and sent us the three desserts on the house. \n\n1) Creme Brulee - hands down the best in town - smooth, silky, velvety and the perfect crust on top. this is one the simplest desserts to make but it defeats many a chef.\n2) Chocolate Fondant  cake - perfectly made - rich and decadent\n3) Bread and Butter pudding - like Cesar salad and chicken another dish i rarely order anywhere - was different from ALL its cousins in town and was actually very nice - served with a yummy homemade banana ice-cream - this i loved and will have with a little chocolate sauce. and maybe fresh bananas and caramelized walnuts (see Aman here is a new dessert - simple and easy)\n\nover all experience - was FABULOUS - and i am going to re-inforce my statement about AMAN VIRJI becoming a culinary force to be reckoned with in the near future  \n\nThank you 44 team you have just become one of my top 10","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-23T14:43:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-25T14:25:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"100001692464184","name":"Amna Jatoi"},{"id":"697092175","name":"Mohammadi Kakal"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"1108385601","name":"Marvi Jatoi"},{"id":"509507958","name":"Omair Ahmed"},{"id":"777621756","name":"Masooma Dharamsey"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1288336373","name":"Muffi Halai"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Well except maybe authentic chinese Bok choy with garlic! Anyhow I love China Kitchen. I went there initially when it opened and my friend (who loves Chinese) was swooning by the end of the meal. And I would agree the cuisine at China K is definitive of delectable. \nMoving on! Im not much of a sea food person either but I tried the Crab Rangoon the wontons were scrumptious and melted in my mouth. Will definitely have them again. Also tried the chicken lettuce wraps, the iceberg was crisp and the chicken melange was succulent. I wasn't as adventurous as to try the prawn on toast but since it was devoured I'm sure it was pretty fantastic too.\nI also tried the duck for the very first time and to my surprise quite liked the meat. But since i'm not an expert on duck meat cant say more :)\nKung Pao chicken at China K keeps getting better with every visit. The Orange chicken was zippy and full of flavor. Another favorite was the Singapore Noodles, a perfect, seasoned and light combination of veggies and noodles. The wasabi sauce on the Wasabi prawns was a little too sharp. And how can i forget the Crispy Beef? The sticky sauce is so tangy and rich - heavenly!\nIt was a perfect meal, everyone at the table enjoyed their food, the ambience was lovely and we were probably the loudest bunch in the restaurant. \n\nSpecial thank you to the hostess :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-04T21:48:47+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-06T08:12:50+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"516567649","name":"Fatema Zahra Munir Ahmed"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"100001432075867","name":"Suhaila Tobeh"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"738981577","name":"Sohail Maskatiya"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzM4OTgxNTc3","before":"Nzc3MjMzMDQy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"392586077459215","from":{"name":"Ahsan Rasheed","id":"199900911"},"message":"How were serving sizes?

Was advised on the phone to make it 8:30 to which I showed my inability so they very kindly acceded to my request to accommodate us at 9:00 for which I am extremely grateful to the management of CK.  reached at 8:50 pm to find the restaurant empty but soon other customers started to arrive and by the time we left at around 10:00 the place was still half empty (CK management, why was I asked to make my reservation 8:30 instead of 9:00 when the restaurant was not booked to full capacity?) the servers were very courteous and the food didn't take much time to arrive at the table - 10/10 for service. Starters - Hot & Sour Soup - was liked by all 4 of us but it was a bit too sour, would taste even better if the vinegar is put on hold, Wasabi Prawns - 4 decent sized prawns fried and coated in wasabi/creamy white sauce served luke warm and Crab Rangoon - creamy crab meat wontons served cold - 6/10 for starters.  Main courses, Mu Shu Chicken - DIY paper thin pancakes served separately with chicken qeema and a black sauce - very desi stuff, Kung Pao Chicken - chunks of boneless chicken in red sauce with veggies and cashew nuts which were liked by all, Beef Steak - chunks of beef with veggies in black sauce, again liked by all, egg fried rice and chicken chowmein (very salty with excessive use of soy sauce with hardly any chicken meat in it) - 7/10 for main courses.  Prices reduced since my earlier visit and quantities much improved, the above order would suffice 5 persons easily. Total damage approx 5K inclusive of soft drinks and 16% GST.

Goes well with the Jasmine Rice. \n\nThai Khao Suey: a great spicy twist blending Khao suey with Paad-Thai. \nSteamed Jasmine Rice: No complaints. \n\nPrawn in Tamarind Sauce: Haven't quite tried anything like it before but an excellent complement to your meal. It was spicy though.  \n\nAssorted Sushi and Maki:\n\nThis included Tuna, Pink Salmon, Crab Sticks and Prawn. The Maki included California Maki, Spicy Tuna and some Deep Fried Maki. \n\nI have never had deep-fried Maki before but it is excellent and a must-have. Another must-have is the Bulgogi.\n\nThe food was sent fresh to my home in KDA-1 and travelled well and the packaging and aesthetics left no room for complaints. General portions of wasabi, pickled ginger and soy sauce complemented the meal well. \n\nTHE UPPER-CRUST:\n\nPhilly Steak Sandwich : The beef was tender and I loved the panini and the cheese. The caramelised onions are always welcome in liberal portions and there are no complaints there. The beef did, however, require a little more seasoning in terms of salt and pepper.  \n\nSpaghetti Bolognese: Tasted perfect but the spaghetti seemed to be a little broken and I had to season it with parmigiano and salt n pepper. Overall the basic flavour was reminiscent of any Italian household / home-made bolognese. So no complaints.  \n\nCroissants: That's for breakfast tomorrow morning.

It was such a tough piece that we were having trouble even cutting it into 2 with a knife and fork. Not sure if it was a very old piece of fish or whale meat but it was disgusting to look and definitely not at all like what I had eaten at BOTS a little while earlier.\n\nNeedless to say we threw it away and will really think twice about at least getting take away from there.

Captain Saleem, the man, or should I say his \"venture\", needs no introduction (because now it?s more like a pvt.

His team never fails to impress me. Every time I've opted for another kaptaan, I have been disappointed?to the point where I have been reprimanded by my friends for making the evening uncomfortable by going on and on about how captain saleems food tastes SO much better than his rivals. The point is, don't waste your evening in another kaptaans boat if you want to enjoy the real crabbing experience, saleem will never disappoint you and will never fail to surprise you with new crab-concoctions each time you hire him.

I'm sure most of the members here are familiar with the term, ?crabbing? and know that in karachi it (crabbing) revolves around, not the act of fishing for crabs in the sea, but just feasting on them. Captain Saleem, the man, or should I say his \"venture\", needs no introduction (because now it?s more like a pvt. Ltd company; he should seriously consider registering it at the kse), was our ?Kaptaan?. To cut to the chase, he did a fantastic job last night. The chutney was phenomenal. His team never fails to impress me. Every time I've opted for another kaptaan, I have been disappointed?to the point where I have been reprimanded by my friends for making the evening uncomfortable by going on and on about how captain saleems food tastes SO much better than his rivals. The point is, don't waste your evening in another kaptaans boat if you want to enjoy the real crabbing experience, saleem will never disappoint you and will never fail to surprise you with new crab-concoctions each time you hire him. Ask Saleem to serve boiled claws. I tried them for the first time last night. They were delicious. I still love my masala ones but this was a pleasant change. Enjoy a crab-splurge, its worth it; especially in this weather!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-12T06:19:27+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-12T13:03:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"502442918","name":"Rabeea Ishtiaq"},{"id":"596505603","name":"Shehryar Rauf Baig"},{"id":"500472749","name":"Aurangzeb 'pinks' Siddiqui"},{"id":"521690093","name":"Louie Sh"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"586043191","name":"Mustafa Mohomedally"},{"id":"509507958","name":"Omair Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5NTA3OTU4","before":"NTAyNDQyOTE4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"294801580570999","from":{"name":"Syed Adil Ahmed","id":"669175907"},"message":"Saleem is the man...no doubt about it","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-12T06:27:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"294805853903905","from":{"name":"Javaria Javed","id":"1640895663"},"message":"Not just the Chutney but everythinmg he provides is amazing..Capt Saleem....quite favourite and popular amongst crabbing lovers....agreed with Mr.Adl and Farah Qadri...he's the man!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-12T06:42:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"514058187","name":"Farah Qadri","type":"user","offset":154,"length":11}]},{"id":"294806617237162","from":{"name":"Ahmed Shahnawaz","id":"100000759794024"},"message":"i prefer captain bilal dunno why","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-12T06:44:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"294807997237024","from":{"name":"Afroza Bhamani","id":"846664538"},"message":"Please let me know the number and the charges; would really appreciate it","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-12T06:51:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"294808960570261","from":{"name":"Kamran Hasan","id":"777233042"},"message":"also let me no the the no and charges","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-12T06:55:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"294810267236797","from":{"name":"Farah Qadri","id":"514058187"},"message":"Capt.
