To enlist all that's good in Nando's, it would be something like this:\n\n* Peri Bites (No questions asked!)\n* Cataplana (It's served in a canteen-ish serving, great spices, great flavors; is a rice+vegetables+chicken dish)\n* Espetada (A long skewer having good, marinated pieces of chicken and vegetables, with rice accompanying them)\n* Chicken Caesar Salad (I know there are many other places that make it better, but their's is good too)\n* Coffee Cake Slice\n\nP.S. Get soft drinks, not gourmet drinks. The soft drinks have unlimited refills too.

Maybe, if it is indeed cold and tasteless, can I just tip my server for his excellent service and drop the amount of the bill into the nearest TCF box?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-25T05:37:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100000605305028","name":"Nandos Pakistan","type":"user","offset":5,"length":15}]}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTkyMDgzNjA3NTA5NDYw","before":"NTkxNTE0MzgwODk5NzE2"}}},"restaurantName":"Nando's"},{"id":"165861103465048_591284114256076","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100003681493822"},"message":"Which site can I see all Iftar deals available in town,I don't see Khi snob covering all.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-23T20:38:03+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-24T19:34:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"100000539983407","name":"Mohsin Tasawar"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"100000579313166","name":"Xobi Shah"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNTc5MzEzMTY2","before":"NzE3NzYwNjU4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"591284817589339","from":{"name":"Xobi Shah","id":"100000579313166"},"message":"umm dere was one but don't remeber it! try Nando's nyway.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T20:40:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591285857589235","from":{"name":"Muhammad Hammad Ab","id":"852905477"},"message":"Foodpanda.com.pk\nUrbanite.pk","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T20:43:24+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591287530922401","from":{"name":"Saima Achria","id":"518308086"},"message":"Having deals listed on khi snob is a paid service - having just the restaurants basic info listed is at their discretion","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T20:48:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591289377588883","from":{"name":"Akash Jeswani","id":"100001236888717"},"message":"May be Fc pk","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-23T20:54:46+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"591800330871121","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100003681493822"},"message":"Thanks all","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-24T19:34:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTkxODAwMzMwODcxMTIx","before":"NTkxMjg0ODE3NTg5MzM5"}}},"restaurantName":"Nando's"},{"id":"165861103465048_589257341125420","from":{"name":"Ahsan Kidwai","id":"501727510"},"message":"From iftaari at Gon Pacci to Nando's to Pizza Hut to Forty4 to Noodle House to Lantern to xyz (with all due respect to each and every eatery), nothing beats iftaar over crabbing at the Kemari Port!
