THAT teriyaki was what i returned for to The Noodle House Pakistan but by that time, we were all done with the food, and once the rhythm breaks, its just not fun anymore. so we just had one piece and were done. i was so sad. because the second teriyaki he cooked for us was just amazing, there was just no space for us to eat more. i asked him, what went wrong with the first one, said the new one had some tenderiser in it. well, thats a go chef. Please always use tenderiser. it works well. \n\ncomplimentary mango pudding was served in order to make up the teriyaki. i would rate it a (7/10) and a 10/10 for being considerate. \n\nfor all the good things, i still dont like being charged for whats not edible for me. and i did not enjoying paying for that teriyaki. \n\nan over all 6/10 for me on the second visit. i think the 3rd visit will take a while, and cant risk it with anyone else. will have to go alone.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-08-29T18:52:34+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-29T18:52:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1257283317","name":"Aymun Zafar"},{"id":"100001089240373","name":"Abdul Basit Sivany"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTc1Mjc2NzUy","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"picture":"http://photos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/t1/1185297_10151972482393125_1418762510_s.jpg","link":"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid\u003d10151972482393125&set\u003dpcb.611417202242767&type\u003d1&relevant_count\u003d9","icon":"http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif","restaurantName":"The Noodle House Pakistan"},{"id":"165861103465048_599473663437121","from":{"name":"Haris Shaikh","id":"694723124"},"message":"hello again everyone. in reference to my earlier post about noodle house and the wrong billing, and me not checking what it was and just paying and realising later it wasn't my bill, i went back again for correction. sadly, couldn't meet Mr. Salman, but i met Mr. Kunwar who was a generous man, very elegant and knew how to handle a problem, without any further problems. \n\nwe were seated on a table for two, it was me and a friend. while we waited for our refund, we were generously treated first with a slice of cake and to top that we were given a choice to choose from their list of beverages. we chose lemon mint cooler. both were great and by the time we finished that, Mr. Kunwar had everything sorted out and he joined us on the table explaining what went wrong. i was refunded Rs. 860 and was provided the correct receipt this time. \n\nalot to learn from here for the wise i suppose. truly appreciate the customer service and i guess i will be an indefinite customer for The Noodle House Pakistan.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-08-06T20:25:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-07T08:14:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"510852148","name":"Fatima Akhund"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1346560868","name":"Hira Javed Saya"},{"id":"504929000","name":"Faraz Hyder"},{"id":"641365023","name":"Samar Khan"},{"id":"592867967","name":"Saad Ahmed Shah"},{"id":"780325402","name":"Rakhi Talib"},{"id":"100002154180249","name":"Afifa J Maniar"},{"id":"1497320748","name":"Fauzia Farhan Hashmat"},{"id":"514147438","name":"Sulaim Nensey"},{"id":"682502588","name":"Mahin Khalid Siddiqui"},{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"633355515","name":"Shanz?
