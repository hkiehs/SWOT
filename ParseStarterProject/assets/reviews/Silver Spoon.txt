Most of the food was home cooked and the event manager was her mother/my sister. Since it's December we decided to do a winter and Christmas theme. Of red and white. With a Christmas tree all decked up and stockings for goodie bags. Lots of tinsel fairy lights and colorful baubles.\n\nThe two items we did get from outside were \n\n1) dark chocolate fudge cake with chocolate ganache (all are sick of the fondant cakes - no offence to anyone) and it was done by our fav caker - Uzma Saeed of Goodsies Cupcakes {the patron cake saint for SWOT}. The cake was adorned with Ariana's favourite things made out of fondant....mermaids, makeup and jewellery!!!!!! [Ariana had asked for spiders and cockroaches too but we the adults decided she was being funny - we hope]. The cake was a 5 pound rectangular mass of deliciousness. It was not too high - the party was for three year olds. And we hate food being wasted. So small neat squares. Which many of the tiny tots had seconds and even thirds. As always the cake was a huge hit.\n\n2) next Basma and I wanted something from our childhood too. So we got gol guppas daahi puris and kebab rolls from Adib's Silver Spoon - the Original One - wow what a spectacular addition that was especially for the mommies who came with their babies. The fresh tangy water, the sweet flavors of the yogurt with the special masala sprinkled over it. Yum yum yum.....I don't think I got my fill of it. \n\nGod bless my little one and may she have many many more lovely days as she had this one. She was thrilled at the attention and being center of attention (but then she always is) khala's little girl","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-22T19:58:51+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-24T05:44:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100006500231409","name":"Erum Ejaz"},{"id":"816865264","name":"Muhammad Arsalan Siddiqui"},{"id":"631140534","name":"Amna Faisal Ahmed"},{"id":"100001842374397","name":"Tariq Mughal"},{"id":"1013437557","name":"Farhan Hafeez"},{"id":"504520279","name":"Aamir Butt"},{"id":"805195531","name":"Amna Shah"},{"id":"565262130","name":"Sharjeel Ahmed Khan"},{"id":"1335783781","name":"Muhammad Hafeezuddin Hussain"},{"id":"676576184","name":"Ali Akhtar Allah Ditta"},{"id":"615300809","name":"Majid Shaikh"},{"id":"100000613630813","name":"Zoja Noaman"},{"id":"100003197584619","name":"Mairaj Khan"},{"id":"100001083566319","name":"Tahira I.

Ended up at Peking (this AWKWARD Chinese place at Bahadurabad) and I have been forced to share my review since i spent ...oh sorry wasted 1600 bucks. P.S the following pictures and reviews are about to notify serious competition to Golden Dragon, Red Emperor, Ginsoy and Chairman Mao....\nThe burger qaum (DHA/Clifton residents) is set to dine in at pricey places! Well long live all u eateries.....u guys charge for hygiene, standard and items mentioned on your menus!\n\nSo me and Shahroz Ali visited PEKING....the place was really really really shady but fully crowded with families since it was a sunday night. To my utter disappointed, the moment i opened the menu, my jaw dropped wide open! Nothing for less than Rs.500. Since i found it way to awkward (thinking i wud have rather bin to Red Emperor or Ginsoy for Chinese Dine in) i thought i'd place my order. We ordered 1 Chicken Fried Rice, 1 Lemon Chicken and 1 Hot n Sour Soup. The waiter told the servings were for 2 and my heart sank further. (so i was about to have 250 k sabzi chawal. 250 ka laal paani and nimboo murgi for 250! My hard earned Quaid e Azam :'( ) The order arrived within  15 mins while I kept observing the place. The trays they used were the steel ones used at burns road k tikkay wale....Neways this is what I got\n\nHot N Sour Soup. Simply liquid Ketchup, loaded with Hara Dhania (coriander) for God knows what reason\nLemon Chicken : Boiled chicken, cornflour in the stock as the gravy and literally half a litre lemon juice along with more lemon slices compared to the chicken\nChicken fried rice: Tasteless, completely raw veges\n\nHad a few bites and eventually got it all packed, since it got really late...ended up at Indus for Biryani! The portions were actually scanty and...v tried this place just for the heck of it.....Never Again\nFor all those who thought i can never criticize a place, here it it. I never post reviews about my bad experiences since if i just like to let go off being mean, but this place got my pukes stuck within my throat only!

Noodles were finished last eve and so were the accompanying raw veggies, paapri and the addictive laal chutney.  The curry was good enuff for 6-7 servings so this eve made my own version of SF's leftover Khowsuey.  Boiled a pack of noodles, poured the curry on top of it, added some freshly cut coriander and spring onions.  With no leftover paapri, added some Chill Flavored Kurkure, Tom Yum Kung Flavored Peanuts and Special Chaat Masala that I got from Silver Spoon on my last visit there (yes this is the masala that Silver Spoon sprinkles on their Meethi Puri).  So a whole new flavored Khowsuey this eve that didn't taste like the leftovers from yesterday.  SF you should either increase the quantity of noodles or reduce the quantity of curry by half.

At that moment no body knew about Kabab Rolls they were the one's who introduced and named KABAB ROLL to the people of Karachi... at first people didn't even knew how to open the wrapper of kabab rolls. After their unique taste and popularity they decided to come out of the market and go at a good location so they could promote their unique product to the world. So they rented the place where silver spoon snacks is located now in 1971. As they had a history in restaurants and food they were the 3rd generation in this business. Their Grandfather Late Amjud Ahmed started this business in india in 1910 and made his chains of Amjudia Hotels and Restaurants all over india in his hard worked 20 years and made his company the 1st muslim owned Limited Co. in india as Amjudia Pvt. Ltd. So after partition of the two countries his grand childrens Mojib, Khatib, Habib & Adib followed the tradition and opened the restaurants in karachi. After the big sucess of Silver Spoon Restaurant they needed a bigger place to accommodate and fulfill the needs of their beloved customers so they decided to shift to a bigger place and they shifted on the same road near jheel park and allied bank which was the REAL SILVER SPOON RESTAURANT. And they also opened another popular restaurant by the name of Mojib's Dinner near jheel park. As they shifted the place which is known as silver spoon snacks now was rented by someone else and due to the popularity of the previous business of silver spoon they decided to use the name as it is being used now since then, because in our country u cannot register the name any one can open a silver spoon anywhere in Pakistan without any affiliation. I wold like to ask Mr. Hammad Ur Rehman Awan that please stop misguiding people and by the way mr. awan how could u invent BIHARI KABAB untill or unless you are a behari as they are and they have a history to prove it. We know that you want people to think that you are the real Silver Spoon... Let the taste and quality and the product be the judge of that. Thank You..\n\nI am sorry if i have offended anyone but the truth is the truth!","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-03-20T07:06:13+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-20T12:35:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1655946149","name":"Imtiaz Merchant"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"100001073218879","name":"Talha Ahmed"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"703368408","name":"Irfan Ali Siddiki"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"1626883423","name":"Fatema Murtaza Lacewala"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTYyNjg4MzQyMw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTY1NTk0NjE0OQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"523569157694239","from":{"name":"Ayza Alvi","id":"551492961"},"message":"Why was mojib shut down , I want it back plz","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-20T08:39:58+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"523569707694184","from":{"name":"Luciferz Angel","id":"792470170"},"message":"Mojib's had the best grilled chicken cheese sandwich...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-20T08:42:42+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"523573921027096","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Thanks Talha Ahmed, in fact after the controversy of the other Silver Spoon claiming to be original, I had decided to go and meet Adib Sahib personally to know the history as I am friends with one of his relatives.

It's the fear of getting yourself food poisoned, which brings out the taste. The Chatkharaa's and Mirchi's are no fun when you have everything prepared from mineral water and washed with clean water. Aamina Jahangir there is a place in Patel Para, Garden West. Dawn did a review and you can read it at http://www.dawn.com/2011/05/15/eating-out-street-food-at-its-best.html. I have literally grown up eating mouth watering chaat and sev puri's from there. They start around 4 and end everything by 8 or 9. Do give it a shot, it's worth the hassle driving there.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-07T14:19:43+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"501859943","name":"Aamina Jahangir","type":"user","offset":331,"length":15}]},{"id":"273353582715799","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Shamsu's Chaat used to be very good and i am sure it still is though I've not had it for a decade.  But if one wants to have it indoors then Mirchi on Badar Commercial is the best option.  If you don't mind sitting in the car or sit on the roadside tables then Cool Inn at Clifton is not a bad place.  Both Mirchi in Cool Inn use mineral water to prepare their chutneys and are hygienic. Going all the way to Garden East to Shamsu in this traffic is a bit too much for me although I still go halfway to Silver Spoon at Allama Iqbal Road every once in a while to have the Pani Puri, Dahi Puri and Kabab Rolls which is the best available in town.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-07T14:21:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjczMzUzNTgyNzE1Nzk5","before":"MjczMjk4NTQ2MDU0NjM2"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_273298232721334/comments?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMjczMzUzNTgyNzE1Nzk5"}},"restaurantName":"Silver Spoon"}]}
