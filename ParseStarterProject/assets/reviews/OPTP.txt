It surely gave my chicken wingssss... \n\nOk so we ordered 1 Zinger, 1 Beef burger with cheese, for our two outcasts :p \nAnd countless Qtr. Broasts (i lost count after the first 6)\n\nZinger: It looked appetising, amazing size good value for money. And by the look of the empty devoured plate in the end im pretty sure It was well enjoyed.\n\nBeef Burger with Cheese:\nOrdered by our second non brostie.\nUpon asking hi the rating went like \nIt was great..good.. Average tha..\nSo if u are trying to compare it to the BK ka whooper like we initially were trying to do, look the other way :p\n\nThe fried chickies aka Karachi ka Broast.\nThe first look: Defiantly huge portions.\nToo much on the oily side.\nThe fries looked like dead dried fishes. \nTaste: according to one fellow foodie the wings tasted like buffalo wings (i wouldnt know i fed mine to the kitties) \n\nPs: the fresh lime i ordered was nimbo pani with an over load of kali mirch.. Yeekkhh \n\n \nOverall:\nHad an average taste, very average nothing to rave about. All the hype is defiantly over rated.    \nService was very sad, one waiter running around the whole floor.\nWill not be going again for the food.\nBut then again the prices were dirt cheap so i wouldnt expect anything else. \n\nALSO after all that being said.\nAll those people who care about hygiene should avoide. \nThe place is crawling with cats. \nEven though i am well. But two of our members fell sick as soon as they reached home. Which is unacceptable.There was something seriously wrong with the chicken. So i think a visit from the health inspectors is due to that place.  \nUntil that i think im staying away.\n\nLast but not the least.\nThankyou everyone who joined us. Was a pleasure meeting you guys. :) \nHope to see you guys again real soon.\n\n*An invader from Foodies Food Invasions*","type":"photo","created_time":"2014-01-05T15:13:51+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-10T21:02:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000595182709","name":"Umair Chaudhry UC"},{"id":"100000605712128","name":"Kashif Jakhrani"},{"id":"100001971013076","name":"Zohaib Hassan"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"816865264","name":"Muhammad Arsalan Siddiqui"},{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"873280323","name":"Umair Zia"},{"id":"100001542765153","name":"Umair Zahid"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"100000107764417","name":"M Kashif Malik"},{"id":"1224016566","name":"Asif Rasheed Ghani"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"100002154180249","name":"Afifa J Maniar"},{"id":"617393721","name":"Ali Sheheryar Khan"},{"id":"100001075455207","name":"Ahsan Ahmed"},{"id":"568465423","name":"Yasir Hasan"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"1236316260","name":"Taimoor Nadeem"},{"id":"669320704","name":"Fahad Azad"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"742775803","name":"Nabeel Islam"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"517581738","name":"Armughan Ahmed Faruqi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3NTgxNzM4","before":"MTAwMDAwNTk1MTgyNzA5"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_677950858922734/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTE3NTgxNzM4"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"677952425589244","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Thats the branch i got a tharki roach from, lin marofying on my food with his rather wiggly antennae! :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:17:48+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677952932255860","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"We missed u too Sohaaaa :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:18:59+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677953475589139","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"hahaha Me not tharki roach :p I m shadeedun shareefun :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:19:41+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677956665588820","from":{"name":"Syeda Wajeeha","id":"564340227"},"message":"Love there raita uff","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-05T15:26:25+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"677957455588741","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Zaid Tehsin: ya sorry to burst ur bubble but they do and feel free not to read it though.

But being a sunday night, and having crazy rush everywhere else, we didn't have much of an option for desi food.\nSo anyway, as soon as we got seated, the waiters were very polite and courteous. Took our order quickly, were prompt with suggestions, served quickly and were generally impressive.\nFirst came the complimentary Gol Guppay and Dahi Puri - both of which were 9/10!! the paani in gol gappay was better than any other i've tasted and the puris in both were crisp and tasty.\nThen the food - we ordered dum ka keema, malai boti, dhaaga kebab, mutton karhai and fish tikka. (with roghni & garlic naan plus sheermal)\nEverything tasted AMAZING except for the fisk tikka. That was the only thing we didn't enjoy.\nThen we ordered dessert (shahi tukray and gulab jamun), both of which were not good.\nOverall speaking - a VERY good experience with food and service. 8/10 with only issues being that dessert was not good at all and fish tikka was stale. (Plus a little on the pricey side ~ 900/person.)\nVery happy with the experience :D","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-16T16:06:12+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-17T08:09:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000051806482","name":"Saquib Currim"},{"id":"581870213","name":"Saad Noma"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100001772445260","name":"Zamzam Shah"},{"id":"100003079123808","name":"Waseem Izzat"},{"id":"100002252913885","name":"Haseeb Sami"},{"id":"705430280","name":"Haris Mahmood"},{"id":"1257237310","name":"Taha Usman"},{"id":"1195811332","name":"Ahmed Shahab"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"758853691","name":"Shah M Alam"},{"id":"728987421","name":"Rayyan Sohail"},{"id":"100000446704703","name":"Almas Mehmood"},{"id":"100007310070601","name":"Urban KaveGirl"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"100000764441277","name":"Shahyaan Abd"},{"id":"597000855","name":"Anita N Anil"},{"id":"1360287056","name":"Afshan Riaz Bhayani"},{"id":"756768261","name":"Muhammad Aslam"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"100002364449168","name":"Mansoor Hussain"},{"id":"745130093","name":"HG Bachani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ1MTMwMDkz","before":"MTAwMDAwMDUxODA2NDgy"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_667621676622319/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzQ1MTMwMDkz"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"667630359954784","from":{"name":"Muhammad Aslam","id":"756768261"},"message":"I have been going there ever since they had opened .

Ordered Southern Fried Chicken for Takeaway from the recently opened outlet adjacent to National Stadium, and the order was ready within 15 minutes.  The place still doesn't accept credit cards, so that's a bummer.\n\nThe economics behind pricing of chicken is weird, with 2 pieces for PKR300, and 3 pieces for PKR410 -- with per unit cost of chicken increasing substantially if one wants to order 4 pieces of chicken.  The economically efficient quantity to order is in multiples of 3.\n\nThe fried chicken was just perfect -- probably the best I've had in a while from anywhere in the world.  The fried chicken served was cooked well, barely had any greasy elements, and just had the perfect crisp.  It is insanely difficult to find well-cooked non-greasy fried chicken, and Burger Inc. certainly makes the cut.\n\nThe fried chicken is better than the fried-in-diesel chicken at KFC, the synthetic chicken at OPTP, and even Popeye's (at par, if not better).\n\nWill definitely be trying it again, as soon as they start accepting plastic!\n\nOverall Rating -- 8.5/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-05T11:56:53+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-06T12:03:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"554105251","name":"Rida Shoaib"},{"id":"807200363","name":"Laila Jatoi"},{"id":"517543633","name":"Ahmed Siddiqui"},{"id":"579933313","name":"Ali Daudpota"},{"id":"667017252","name":"Taha Javed"},{"id":"1424317236","name":"Anwer Jamal Chandna"},{"id":"559881298","name":"Nadia Mahasin"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"518748331","name":"Zia Saeed"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"100002505633547","name":"Umme Kulsoom Khalid Ahmed"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"100001388892633","name":"Zahra Mirza"},{"id":"731221630","name":"Usama Aziz"},{"id":"1062305825","name":"Warood Chaudhary"},{"id":"780560073","name":"Anita Zeeshan Al-Najjar"},{"id":"549655574","name":"Nazish Huda"},{"id":"654231486","name":"Sami Khan"},{"id":"514973279","name":"Ahmad Jawed"},{"id":"645995992","name":"Rida Sadiq"},{"id":"688336352","name":"Abbas Farid"},{"id":"588501861","name":"Tanveer Farooq"},{"id":"100000673113966","name":"Nashra Jamil"},{"id":"100001352416590","name":"Zulekha Rizwan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMzUyNDE2NTkw","before":"NTU0MTA1MjUx"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_645382885512865/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dMTAwMDAxMzUyNDE2NTkw"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"645386475512506","from":{"name":"Anum Rasheed","id":"100001881992250"},"message":"I like your practical use of economics there.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-05T12:05:55+0000","like_count":9,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645387302179090","from":{"name":"Tehreem Fatima","id":"892195391"},"message":"synthetic chicken hahah!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-05T12:08:57+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645387788845708","from":{"name":"Hammad Ahmed","id":"712230730"},"message":"I had their trademark tribeca beef burger a week back,and found it to be one of the best tasting burgers around.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-05T12:10:33+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645389272178893","from":{"name":"Saad Siddiqui","id":"507770148"},"message":"They probably planned the entire setup to get back at an annoying microeconomics question they once encountered, and someone in the back is studying consumer behaviour and indifference curves.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-05T12:16:20+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645391362178684","from":{"name":"Sahrish Naseer","id":"1807053822"},"message":"Pieces","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-05T12:25:06+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"645391962178624","from":{"name":"Romano Karim Yusuf","id":"832750315"},"message":"Southern 'Friend' Chicken'?

Also another thing that is annoying about them is the quantity of the dip they put on the fries, because theyve not standardized it, the quantity varies each time.\nHowever this is not the case that Ill be discussing today. I went to OPTP DMTR today and I was utterly surprised to see the staff there. They were loudly talking in a \"Tu Tara\" manner among themselves. \"Aye inko fries dede pehle, aye daant andar rakh kaam kar jaldi\". They looked untrained and uneducated. Oh well as long as I get my order I dont care. Just as I was observing them, a goodlooking lady came to the counter to place her order and the cashier went absolutely ga ga, he started passing ridiculously obscene comments about her to his fellow their at the counter. I found it extremely unprofessional and disgusting! I feel the management of OPTP has changed about a few months back just after they discontinued their Gourmet Fries (which I miss alot). And after all this the fries that I got were alot more golden than I usually like. I think first of all they should standardize the dipping sauce thing and next hire people who actually respect their customers.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-04T18:00:02+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-05T14:38:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"514973279","name":"Ahmad Jawed"},{"id":"649980502","name":"Bushra Waheed"},{"id":"851275369","name":"Belinda Fonseca"},{"id":"1652751344","name":"Rameen Alvi"},{"id":"100005967459258","name":"Saima Junaid"},{"id":"100000069136891","name":"Obaid Haroon"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"607064491","name":"Tehseena Rafi"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"773317577","name":"Abdul Hafeez"},{"id":"100001352416590","name":"Zulekha Rizwan"},{"id":"100001226932306","name":"Muntaha Khan"},{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"586930217","name":"Maheen Ahsan"},{"id":"1107466591","name":"Emran Mani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEwNzQ2NjU5MQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NTE0OTczMjc5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"645117085539445","from":{"name":"Emran Mani","id":"1107466591"},"message":"- Wherever this thing happening, Upper management is more untrained and uneducated than lower staff.

For sure, teething problems on the operations side and a limited menu. However, the Whopper with Cheese was 80% like the burgers that I have eaten at BK in other countries. The main difference being that this was more well done and a touch drier than the prior experiences. That may be a personal thing since I also eat my steak medium rare! The basic taste of the burger was the flame grilled rather than fried that I prefer but it did seem a tad hastily prepared. My sense is that within a short period of time, the minor issues that exist will be ironed out and BK will be the same in Karachi as it is for an occasional fast food indulgence abroad.\n\nPreviously, my biggest complaint, and main reason why BK was not usually in my fast food options, were the fries. The new BK fries are 300% better than before and were a pleasant surprise! No, not quite as good as McDonalds or OPTP but pretty darned good ... and I even think they will be better in a few days!! I didn't try the Pepsi but was told by a member of my dining group that it was quite good.\n\nAgain, please keep in mind that my positive comments do not seek to compare a fast food burger to the exceptional offerings that can be had at restaurants such as Forty4. For a fast food burger, I personally prefer the Whopper to the Big Mac... and might think about trying the Angus version too. So, all in all, happy to have BK here in Karachi as another dining option.\n\nFinally, the Dolmen Mall food scene has truly become something special with tons and tons of reputable options for quick food as well as restaurants. Others may differ in their opinion, and I respect that, however I am quite pleased!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-07T14:04:53+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-08T05:20:54+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"633230637","name":"Mahnaz Hadi"},{"id":"850785116","name":"Iruj Khawaja"},{"id":"527720164","name":"Sara Khan"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"100004201268402","name":"Shakil Ahmed"},{"id":"524548090","name":"Saba Shaikh"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"514079467","name":"Noor Rehman"},{"id":"794615955","name":"Adnan Qureshi"},{"id":"739067064","name":"Rakhshanda Khan"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"530485619","name":"Hana Faisal"},{"id":"514492150","name":"Syed Adeel Rizvi"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"864470709","name":"Syed Muhammad Taha Askari"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"100000223684855","name":"Sana A.

Well done OPTP!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-30T05:46:44+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-02T06:22:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"1191222645","name":"M.safdar Murad"},{"id":"592317993","name":"Muhammad Adil"},{"id":"516407498","name":"Shah Qureshi"},{"id":"734228975","name":"Rizwan Mustafa Yusuf"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"552035321","name":"Aamir Shaikh"},{"id":"648921043","name":"Fahad Dawach"},{"id":"515342891","name":"Faizan Munaf"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"641225588","name":"Sarah Akber"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"605016788","name":"Neha Makhdoom"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"571594364","name":"Abdullah Ahmed Muhammad"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"627817873","name":"Ayishah Sohail Siddiqui"},{"id":"654816277","name":"Farrukh Shabbir."},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"574028031","name":"Shiraz Qureshi"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"100001514926283","name":"Acif Hasan Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxNTE0OTI2Mjgz","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc0MDgxMjMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"626398770744610","from":{"name":"Shiraz Qureshi","id":"574028031"},"message":"optp is probably the best fast food available in the country. and above all its an absolute local chain. kudos to the brand !","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T05:56:03+0000","like_count":10,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626415370742950","from":{"name":"Haris Shaikh","id":"694723124"},"message":"had one yesternight aswell :) its awesome","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T07:01:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626420197409134","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"also opened in Dubai few months ago & doing good sales.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T07:21:16+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626421577408996","from":{"name":"Saeed Jamal Tariq","id":"100000444703801"},"message":"Change coming ?

Its spicy but the flavorful spicy instead of just lal mirch.\n\nIm someone who has grown up (to be fat) on broasts from Jans (saddar only zamana say) and Kunduns and King Broast (for those who remember it at Bahadurabad).\n\nIm also a big fan of KFC. \n\nThis juicy succulent chicken is just on another level. I will say this is the best fried/broast chicken out there. Period. (Speaking of which, no blood issue)","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-25T19:38:02+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-27T03:04:19+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"1013410116","name":"Lailumah Shah - Nasar"},{"id":"579933313","name":"Ali Daudpota"},{"id":"666015726","name":"Aina Zulfiqar"},{"id":"549655574","name":"Nazish Huda"},{"id":"647605825","name":"Syed Fareedudin Shah"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"649725153","name":"Ateeb Akber"},{"id":"593675321","name":"Mahtab Saem Khan"},{"id":"520820495","name":"Faiza Tariq Qureshi"},{"id":"563691218","name":"Irma Khatri"},{"id":"698885102","name":"Aamir Ghaffar"},{"id":"100000144649501","name":"Durray Sadaf"},{"id":"627747302","name":"Sana Abdullah"},{"id":"621657436","name":"Saquib Siddiq"},{"id":"617371190","name":"Samar Mughal"},{"id":"522769049","name":"Mujaddid Mujtaba"},{"id":"1065859702","name":"Ammara WAsti"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"1541149685","name":"Muhammad Nasir Jamal"},{"id":"655905403","name":"Ayesha Ahmed Khan"},{"id":"792915494","name":"Ahmad Fayyaz Ali"},{"id":"508081630","name":"Maha Anwar"},{"id":"516407498","name":"Shah Qureshi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE2NDA3NDk4","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc0MDgxMjMx"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_624340587617095/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTE2NDA3NDk4"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"624342820950205","from":{"name":"Ammara Shariq","id":"556372046"},"message":"totally agree the best fried chicken I ve had, it was moist succulent and flavorful on the inside which is very rare","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T19:42:56+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624343187616835","from":{"name":"Ziad Shafi","id":"821975050"},"message":"cost?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T19:44:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624344074283413","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Yum yum!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T19:46:31+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624345760949911","from":{"name":"Asad Ullah Lakho","id":"100000118044523"},"message":"Home delievery??","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-25T19:47:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"624345800949907","from":{"name":"Ahsan Ahmed","id":"651969947"},"message":"1000 for 6 pieces.

It was a very bittersweet experience. \nOrdered at 8:30. Was told that the food would arrive at 9:15pm. After 9:30 had struck the clock, I called to be told that the rider had left and should reach in 15 min. 20 min later, I called again only to be told now that they had ruined the half pizza I had ordered and had been forced to remake it. Although I appreciate that they did not send out substandard food, it still upset me that by now it had been over 1hr and 15 min for the food to arrive.  (compared to the 40 min I was told). \nEventually another phone call resulted in the food being delivered at 10:10pm. Almost an entire hour after the delivery time. \n\nNow to the sweet part. I was happy that the food was warm and hot on arrival. We had ordered the full pizza deal and the half pizza deal. I loved their pepperoni and tikka stix, and the spicy buffalo wings were delicious! We had gone with the Fajita and the Beef pizza. Both were very good, extremely cheesy but not stingy with the toppings which is something I've come notice is a problem most places. The toppings were also flavorful and it was fun dipping them in the sauces. The sauces that were served lacked a little punch. I asked for all 10 types but yet they sent me doubles so wasn't able to try the entire range. The jalapeno ranch and the smokey bbq sauces were great but the hot sauce wasn't spicy at all, and the peri mayonnaise was also lacking in flavor. \n\nAll in all a good value for money (Rs 3198) for 2 1.5 Coke, 1.5 20' Pizza, 2 orders of Stix (Pepporoni and Tikka) and 6 Wings and cumulative 15 sauces. \nI would've been happier if they had been prompt with their delivery, but the customer representative was always extremely polite with me even when I was on the verge of losing my cool. \n\nWill be trying it again, however I'll probably order a little earlier next time to get some grace period.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-21T18:30:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-21T19:12:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"550220458","name":"Humayun Azhar"},{"id":"509315108","name":"Daniyal Qazi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5MzE1MTA4","before":"NTUwMjIwNDU4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"544778615573293","from":{"name":"Daniyal Qazi","id":"509315108"},"message":"I can totally relate to what haooened with you.

The order took 2 hours to reach us during which we went out to go have OPTP instead of waiting for the damned pizzas after repeatedly trying to call 14th street only to find their phone switched off. When we were on our way home we had forgotten about the pizzas when the guy calls me asking to explain the address to him the millionth time. And then i tell him, over the phone, how none of us have any money left for the pizza now that we had the burgers and all. And we honestly had no money. And then i argues with the manager who then called me and i told him in America its \"30 minutes or free\" for pizza delivery. After him trying to negotiate with me and giving me 30-40% off on the pizzas he finally said, \"acha sir aap aise hi lelain\" and we were like whaaat.

Glad that you enjoyed your visit. As far as the credit cards are concerned , sadly the do drya belt does not have a land lines so having wired credit card machines that mostly resturant uses become out of question. \n\nWe did try using microchip machines that work on wireless but these machines some times work and some times dont just like mobile phones in that area. When they work every thing is good , but when they dont it becomes a embarassing situation for both the customer and the management. Therefore we have given up the credit card system until we get a proper landline. Please bear with us till than . \n\nNevertheless we respect and appreciate Karchites for going through the inconvenience of carrying cash and dinning at Kolachi.

Lots of potential. Reasonable prices and value. Not yet ready for primetime with major teething issues but a decent staff who mean well. There is an element of shell shock with some of the staff because I do not think the training has sunk in yet! Nor was it particularly busy when I was there so it wasn't that they were overwhelmed by the hordes descending upon Fatburger for lunch! The person taking my order got confused despite my step by step ordering till her senior colleague standing next to her told her to listen to me rather than talk to me! The credit card machine was not working so I was lucky that I had enough cash since they didn't inform me of that fact till I offered my credit card for payment purposes!! \n\nThen, they got the order horribly wrong TWICE! First we got three chicken burgers when one was supposed to be beef and one order of fries was missing. The second time, cheese was missing from two of the burgers and since they charge for it, that is also something that was a pretty bad mistake despite it being their second attempt! Mariyam Masood felt that the chicken burgers were not particularly special, having tried the jalapeno chicken and the grilled chicken ones. The jalapeno beef burger was fairly good altho' I couldn't honestly say that it would be preferred over the OPTP version ... I will try it one more time before I make up my mind about that! I personally liked the thick cut fries a lot and the fact that you got a drink with unlimited refills ... and the fountain version of coke was decent too. Mariyam still felt OPTP fries were better. \n\nWhen I spoke to the manager, he was appropriately apologetic and attentive, even offering free milkshakes which were politely declined since my objective was to help them sort out our order and point out areas of improvement rather than get free stuff!! To their credit, the staff tried even though it didn't work out particularly well this time. It was their first day so while it was not an outstanding experience, I feel the food, ambiance and Fatburger deserve a couple of additional looks before I make up my mind about whether I am going to be a regular customer or not! I will say though, that by the time we were leaving, the line was out the door and probably caused even more issues today ... yikes!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-05T15:56:38+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-06T13:02:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"508976973","name":"Shanaya Shahpur Maneckji"},{"id":"100000245074195","name":"Akbar Khan"},{"id":"579933313","name":"Ali Daudpota"},{"id":"571060327","name":"Fawad Irshad"},{"id":"100001011410786","name":"Shaban Ali Nagri"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMDExNDEwNzg2","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"483435121707643","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"Credit card links were down across mmost of the city this afternoon between 11am and till around 2pm or later. lets not put the blame on Fatburger when they were trying to swipe and realised there was an issue","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-05T16:00:52+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"483436381707517","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"I understand that there was an issue as Hyperstar also had problems.

Decided on ordering the food from Arab Connection. Placed the order for Belly Dancer and Beefita / Chickita. On a brighter the service was excellent and the food arrived on the time they had committed. Another plus point would that the food is very very reasonably priced. \n\nThe Belly Dancer which is a replacement of sort of shawarmas was a disappointment. I thought it would have the authentic taste of Middle East as claimed on their facebook page, it was nowhere to be found. It was nothing like the shawarmas that are served in Saudi Arabia. SWOTTIES who have been for Umrah / Hajj would probably know what I am talking about as it has a very specific taste which I have yet to sample in Pakistan. \n\nThe Beefita / Chickita was at best, average. The taste was bland though it did have a decent serving. The only good thing about the meal was their dipping sauces aka the three wishes. The fries that came along were sort of a replica of the fries found at the likes of Kaybees or Red Apple. Basically they change colours in a few hours if you do not consume them. \n\nThough the place has been getting good reviews my experience was a little disappointing. I do not think I'd be ordering from them any time soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-16T15:44:32+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-17T07:05:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100000578236531","name":"Naheed Asim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNTc4MjM2NTMx","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"278913335493157","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"I ordered from there last week.
