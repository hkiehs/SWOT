But being a sunday night, and having crazy rush everywhere else, we didn't have much of an option for desi food.\nSo anyway, as soon as we got seated, the waiters were very polite and courteous. Took our order quickly, were prompt with suggestions, served quickly and were generally impressive.\nFirst came the complimentary Gol Guppay and Dahi Puri - both of which were 9/10!! the paani in gol gappay was better than any other i've tasted and the puris in both were crisp and tasty.\nThen the food - we ordered dum ka keema, malai boti, dhaaga kebab, mutton karhai and fish tikka. (with roghni & garlic naan plus sheermal)\nEverything tasted AMAZING except for the fisk tikka. That was the only thing we didn't enjoy.\nThen we ordered dessert (shahi tukray and gulab jamun), both of which were not good.\nOverall speaking - a VERY good experience with food and service. 8/10 with only issues being that dessert was not good at all and fish tikka was stale. (Plus a little on the pricey side ~ 900/person.)\nVery happy with the experience :D","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-16T16:06:12+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-17T08:09:47+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000051806482","name":"Saquib Currim"},{"id":"581870213","name":"Saad Noma"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"100001772445260","name":"Zamzam Shah"},{"id":"100003079123808","name":"Waseem Izzat"},{"id":"100002252913885","name":"Haseeb Sami"},{"id":"705430280","name":"Haris Mahmood"},{"id":"1257237310","name":"Taha Usman"},{"id":"1195811332","name":"Ahmed Shahab"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"758853691","name":"Shah M Alam"},{"id":"728987421","name":"Rayyan Sohail"},{"id":"100000446704703","name":"Almas Mehmood"},{"id":"100007310070601","name":"Urban KaveGirl"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"100000764441277","name":"Shahyaan Abd"},{"id":"597000855","name":"Anita N Anil"},{"id":"1360287056","name":"Afshan Riaz Bhayani"},{"id":"756768261","name":"Muhammad Aslam"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"100002364449168","name":"Mansoor Hussain"},{"id":"745130093","name":"HG Bachani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ1MTMwMDkz","before":"MTAwMDAwMDUxODA2NDgy"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_667621676622319/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzQ1MTMwMDkz"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"667630359954784","from":{"name":"Muhammad Aslam","id":"756768261"},"message":"I have been going there ever since they had opened .

Though it was more on the spicy side for me.\n\nI did not try the other one but according to another fellow swottie it was also quite good.\n\nStarters:\nFor starters we had Chicken Drumsticks, Prawn balls and Prawn Toast.\nThe starters were cold initially but after requesting them to change it we were served with fresh hot ones. \nPrawn toast was a personal favorite .\nI found the prawn balls to be quite bland.\nThey being cold ruined the taste for me a bit.\n\nMains:\nFor Mains there was\nChicken Manchurian:\nMy much raved about personal favorite. Was a Disappointment at RE. The CM lacked gravy and was quite dry and too sweet. But had generous amounts of chicken. It was more of a mashed mush rather then a saucy Manchurian.\n\nBeef in Oyester Sauce:\nDefiantly got me going back for more. Was super yum soft and moist. Bit on the oily side though.\n\nVegetable in Coconut Curry:\nTasted okayish. The veggies were cut quite large making it hard to eat.\nThe coconut curry was an interesting blend of flavors though.\n\nVegetable Chowmein:\nAgain I found it quite bland. Nothing to write about.\n\nThere was one more dish I'm forgetting.\n\nDesserts:\nThere was 5 kinds of desserts \nChocolate moose. Cheesecake \nCustard. Fruit chat. Walnut muffins.\n\nThe cheesecake was loved by everyone.\nI personally loved the chocolate moose.\n\nFRUIT CHAT on a Chinese buffet. Like seriously bhai kia chah rahay ho. Iftari thori hai :P \n\nOverall:\nHad an amazing time meeting up with the people who share the similar love for food. \nThe food was quite cold would have appreciated warmer servings.\nFor taste I would give it a 6/10\nChoice of dishes 5/10\n\nService on the other hand was exceptionally good.\nMeeting the owners themselves was quite pleasent.\nLoved our complimentey cups of greentea.\n\nPriced at 1100 per person.

We were 7 including 2 kids. Safe to say that was starvng and therefore ordered maybe too many starters and subsequently not enough main course but then there is always next time :). \n\nFor starters we ordered Prawn balls, Ginsoy Wraps and Chicken Drum Sticks along with the Thai Soup (the supersize portion they call large) and one order of sweet and sour (white). \n\nLets start with the soup... When a 5 year old drinks a soup and says Yummm... that says enough. One of the best I have had in a long time. The thai was so good that the sweet and sour infact got packed and taken home :).\n\nOf the starters the Wrap was excellent and I wish we had ordered more. The prawn balls were ok and the Chicken wings were also good. Again, if you go there and haven't tried I would recommend the Wraps.\n\nOnto the main course. The Cherry Chilli Chicken and the Spicy Garlic Chicken. I preferred the Cherry Chilli but overall great food. \n\nLet me add that the service was excellent and the staff very friendly... our server was Marison who did an excellent job. \n\nAll in all, a positive experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-27T08:18:01+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-27T10:45:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"502191902","name":"Zaigham Hidayatullah"},{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"638521516","name":"Abdul Ghaffar AG"},{"id":"511168242","name":"Akber Ali Khaliqdina"},{"id":"651674702","name":"Mohsin Baweja"},{"id":"885940595","name":"Ranjenah Bariya"},{"id":"586401160","name":"Ali Sheikh"},{"id":"505056779","name":"Adeel Humayun"},{"id":"1275940201","name":"Noman"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"688747484","name":"Uzair A Kaleem"},{"id":"732459812","name":"Asif Aslam"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"708482342","name":"Saba Basit"},{"id":"515208057","name":"Faizy Farooq"},{"id":"621305514","name":"Aniqa Imran"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjIxMzA1NTE0","before":"NzA1NTMzOTI0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"657927627591724","from":{"name":"Faizy Farooq","id":"515208057"},"message":"i can go to ginsoy again and again and again and again...................... and again.. and still not get bored of the awesome food it has to offer :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:34:56+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"657929180924902","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Great review Shujaat Alavi :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:40:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"853165219","name":"Shujaat Alavi","type":"user","offset":13,"length":13}]},{"id":"657932784257875","from":{"name":"Asim Ibrahim","id":"100004366567543"},"message":"location plz.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:54:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"657964200921400","from":{"name":"Saira Danish Ahmed","id":"1116196206"},"message":"I have been to both Ginsoy main and Ginsoy extension.

So, for 3 people, we ordered the following:\n\n* Chicken Corn Soup (I know, not many people order the classic Chicken Corn Soup, neither do we, but mother just insisted) - We ordered the large serving of the soup, and it was exactly 3 bowls of soup. No more, no less. Yes it was stated already in the menu that it serves 2-3 people, but the Ginsoy - Extreme Chinese fan in us thought there'd be more. Not at all a disappointment though, by any means. It was exactly what Chicken Corn Soup needs to be. Small little bits, but sufficient, of chicken, adequate amount of corn. The soup was just what it was supposed to be.\n\n* Wasabi Prawns for appetizers - The prawns were remarkably done. They had that wasabi-kick in them which was needed to give that \"buzz\" feel you want to have when eating a Wasabi Prawn. Yet again, there were 5 prawns in total, dot. Tastewise: Brilliant.\n\n* Fish Milano (my main) - Their Fish Milano was intended to be  a large fried fillet of fish placed delicately over a bed of green-herbs sauce and coated with cheese served with rice (as understood from the menu). It was exactly as described. I needed something cheesy and rich, and it definitely delivered. The fish was nicely done; flaky, properly fried, the type that just wants you to keep eating it. The green sauce under the fish was generous in quantity, but didn't quite have much of a \"burst of flavors\" that I was hoping for. But the cheese on top took care of that. All in all, a 7/10\n\n* Fish with Jalapeno *something*, mum's main (apologies for not remembering the complete name) - A similar sized fish to mine, fried as nicely as mine was, sat on the plate with sauteed vegetables, a serving of rice, and a small little bowl/cup containing the sauce for this dish. This sauce however, did have a distinctive taste to it. I actually borrowed some of it to use on my fish as well. The one thing common in the 2 mains was that the steamed rice that were served with them were simply the best ever steamed rice I've ever had in my life. The rice had an amazing feel to them in the mouth that is probably inexplicable, yet noticeable. An 7.5/10\n\n* Black Pepper Chicken and Garlic Rice, sold separately (father's main) - Hands down, the highlight of the day. Never have I tasted Black Pepper Chicken done so beautifully crafted in terms of flavor. And the Garlic Rice were \"actually\" Garlic Rice, not a joke in the name of garlic. You could just bring the bowl of rice close to your nostrils and know for a fact how nicely the garlic was incorporated in the rice. Father won, simple. Would definitely give 8.5/10\n\nWe ordered 3 drinks to go with the meal: Mint Julep, Blue Margarita, Peach *something*. In terms of the quantity of the drinks, father (Mint Julep) won again. Then mum (Peach *something) and then me. Again.\nThe experience, in terms of cozy sitting, soothing music being played in the background (rather than some pop/rap/hip-hop artist blaring) and most importantly, taste, was great. Definitely a place I'd go over and over again.\nThe only problem that I have is that the portions could be slightly bigger, because when you pay about Rs. 5000 for a meal of 3, you sort-of expect to be filled to the hilt. But it wasn't so. But it was 5000 bucks well-spent for taste. Definitely well-spent if \"taste\" was (and mostly, it is) meant to be the star. I would just say, if they could slightly beef up their quantity too, it'll do wonders.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-12T03:34:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-12T20:01:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1352533620","name":"Sakina Nanabhai"},{"id":"1088748635","name":"Aqsa Shah"},{"id":"1241948621","name":"Nayab Shakil"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"100002608457065","name":"Haroona Khawar"},{"id":"100001249191882","name":"Fozia Amjad"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"628495513","name":"Fariha Harris"},{"id":"617371190","name":"Samar Mughal"},{"id":"100001697508377","name":"Hira Qazi"},{"id":"550700453","name":"Ammar Amjad"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1202678003","name":"Aisha Naayaab Rao"},{"id":"614747510","name":"Tariq Hameed Siddiqui"},{"id":"100001419761223","name":"Imran Malik"},{"id":"756768261","name":"Muhammad Aslam"},{"id":"535065551","name":"Hassan Khan"},{"id":"789225723","name":"Lalarukh Khursheed Farooqui"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM4MjM2MTI1Ng\u003d\u003d","before":"NTA4OTIyNTA5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"648625911855229","from":{"name":"Sajjad Ahmed","id":"1382361256"},"message":"well described!thanks....but 5000 rupees too much!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-12T04:35:05+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"648630128521474","from":{"name":"Ehtesham Maqbool","id":"189100160"},"message":"Nice detailed review.

Its a neatly done place with a 65 seater restaurant, with 25 seats on the ground floor and 45 on the first floor. As it was a Sunday their was a long line of ppl waiting to be seated,my ordered was punched in by the Cashier himself, it was 930 pm and he stated it would be ready in 30 min, he noted my name and cell no and txted me before the appointed time, quite efficient.Had order the Chicken corn soup,Chicken Mushroom and Young corn curry,Chicken with lots of chilies and Chicken Fried Rice. The ordered was nicely packed and one could easily lift the cardboard boxes out of the bag as they had boxes, the food was piping out, the soup was fresh and tasty and quite rich. The curries had good flavor and I personally like the Chicken Mushroom and young corn more, Chicken fried rice was steamed well and had a nice aroma, quality of rice and ingredients were good. I had heard mixed reviews of Ginosoy and was apprehensive but the food is good and they have won me over hands down, also very economical, meal for 4 persons is around 2k that is 500 per head, and one can choose btwn large and single serving, to caterer to every type of preference. I will definitely try Ginsoy again as its relatively peaceful at Lunch.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-28T21:40:32+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-29T06:05:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1064185636","name":"Ramsha Abid"},{"id":"730910580","name":"Maira Samir"},{"id":"621305514","name":"Aniqa Imran"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"688321217","name":"Cyra Akhtar"},{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"100000999733392","name":"Hadi Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwOTk5NzMzMzky","before":"MTA2NDE4NTYzNg\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"641432949241192","from":{"name":"Umair Tahir","id":"591470264"},"message":"Their quality is goin down day by day.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-29T04:21:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"641452432572577","from":{"name":"Kulsum Wasty","id":"553305273"},"message":"My first experience with Ginsoy was quite average.

Ended up at Peking (this AWKWARD Chinese place at Bahadurabad) and I have been forced to share my review since i spent ...oh sorry wasted 1600 bucks. P.S the following pictures and reviews are about to notify serious competition to Golden Dragon, Red Emperor, Ginsoy and Chairman Mao....\nThe burger qaum (DHA/Clifton residents) is set to dine in at pricey places! Well long live all u eateries.....u guys charge for hygiene, standard and items mentioned on your menus!\n\nSo me and Shahroz Ali visited PEKING....the place was really really really shady but fully crowded with families since it was a sunday night. To my utter disappointed, the moment i opened the menu, my jaw dropped wide open! Nothing for less than Rs.500. Since i found it way to awkward (thinking i wud have rather bin to Red Emperor or Ginsoy for Chinese Dine in) i thought i'd place my order. We ordered 1 Chicken Fried Rice, 1 Lemon Chicken and 1 Hot n Sour Soup. The waiter told the servings were for 2 and my heart sank further. (so i was about to have 250 k sabzi chawal. 250 ka laal paani and nimboo murgi for 250! My hard earned Quaid e Azam :'( ) The order arrived within  15 mins while I kept observing the place. The trays they used were the steel ones used at burns road k tikkay wale....Neways this is what I got\n\nHot N Sour Soup. Simply liquid Ketchup, loaded with Hara Dhania (coriander) for God knows what reason\nLemon Chicken : Boiled chicken, cornflour in the stock as the gravy and literally half a litre lemon juice along with more lemon slices compared to the chicken\nChicken fried rice: Tasteless, completely raw veges\n\nHad a few bites and eventually got it all packed, since it got really late...ended up at Indus for Biryani! The portions were actually scanty and...v tried this place just for the heck of it.....Never Again\nFor all those who thought i can never criticize a place, here it it. I never post reviews about my bad experiences since if i just like to let go off being mean, but this place got my pukes stuck within my throat only!

Hakka Chinese with Mughal Decor.  Red Emperor is as much Hakka, as Ginsoy is Extreme.  The service was terribly slow, and there seemed absence of basic protocol.  Cutlery was missing (even though table was reserved in advance), the place ran out of napkins, no one bothered taking order for drinks (despite reminders), and it took at least twenty minutes before water was finally served (after repeated reminders).  \n\nSoup was served 30 minutes after the order was placed, while the rest of the dishes were served after a solid wait of 50 minutes.  Even then there were order mix-ups, and the staff just wasn't aware of what's happening.  And like always, the excuse was the typical old school one, 'sir aaj rush zyada hai...' -- fair enough.  \n\nThe food is typical Desi-fied Chinese, and hence it doesn't really have any distinct flavor.  Tried the Chicken Schezwan Soup, Fish in Tamarind Sauce, Mixed Fried Rice, Beef Chili Chowmein, and the Sichuan Chicken.  Nothing special about the flavor of any entree.  The serving sizes were massive, making it a favored choice for a value seeker.  With per head cost of roughly PKR500, Red Emperor is a pretty reasonable Desi Chinese option.\n\nThe service is a major bummer, and the food is just fine -- nothing special about it.  The place doesn't really have any differentiating factor, and is equally good (or bad) as Ginsory, or Jade Garden.\n\nNot recommended if one is looking for a smooth flavorful dinner experience.\n\nOverall Rating -- 6/10\n\nOn a side note -- the lightning at the place is just too dim, making going over the menu, and the bill, an arduous task.  I like to see my food -- why can't certain restaurants be more brighter!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-15T00:26:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-15T12:51:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"646760193","name":"Rehma Tirmizey"},{"id":"556911379","name":"Shaheer Hassan"},{"id":"769030393","name":"Muhammad Danniyal Jafri"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"1560344939","name":"Zahid Qureshi"},{"id":"1488962130","name":"Zulfiqar Ali"},{"id":"100001207576659","name":"Faisal Rafiq"},{"id":"100005945647613","name":"Sara H Khan"},{"id":"100000469430091","name":"Nabiyah Fahim"},{"id":"832750315","name":"Romano Karim Yusuf"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"873280323","name":"Umair Zia"},{"id":"801035182","name":"Asad Kamran"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"512542175","name":"Nabiya Fahad Khan"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"684094046","name":"Faiza Hasan"},{"id":"1346742308","name":"Ijlal Malik"},{"id":"1191501552","name":"Ali Majeed S T"},{"id":"561575202","name":"Usuf Haroon"},{"id":"647940246","name":"Maheen Khan Omair"},{"id":"523153232","name":"Hira Humayun"},{"id":"757255502","name":"Faryal Naeem Warind"},{"id":"502333997","name":"Annie Adnan Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAyMzMzOTk3","before":"NjQ2NzYwMTkz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_603313529719801/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTAyMzMzOTk3"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"603412379709916","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Great review once again.

As we ate it we kept turning to each other and saying things like \"wow, yum, mmm!\" The food was all fresh & spicy. Anyhow, I did not find the hot & sour soup (red) satisfying.

The disappointing part was the main course apparently the thai chow mien means a spicier version of Chinese chow mien. Than the real disappointment I am sure almost anyone been to Ginsoy must have had the cherry chilli chicken so I ordered it in RE as well there was no gravy it was fried dry chicken and instead of canned cherries or fresh cherries they had used the sugary type of cherries that you use in cakes which gave the whole dish a very weird sweetish kick. \n\nService was also good something Teamginsoy Ginsoy needs to take a lesson from as when in rush hours the service is not upto the mark.\n\nPricing was also similar to Ginsoy you can have half portions as well but that makes me question if I want Chinese why not go to Ginsoy ?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-28T09:40:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-29T14:52:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d","before":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"577638808953940","from":{"name":"Sana Abdullah","id":"627747302"},"message":"For service and ambiance.

However we'd like to clarify a couple of things. Firstly we are not in the market to compete with Ginsoy. We have no comparison with Ginsoy as they're serving Extreme Chinese and we're serving Hakka Chinese. Hakka Chinese is a distinct cuisine of Chine which is acquainting the market, at the moment. The names may be similar to our competitors but we're solely striving for our identity and not being a substitute for other eateries. The prices have been set to what matches our costing and market, nor an 'at par' comparison with Ginsoy. There is nothing 'wannabe' about it if our ambiance depicts the name we've given to our eatery. We're serving food to please customers like you and that would remain our first and foremost priority. Hope to see you soon while we'll make sure your next experience is a better one:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-06-29T10:27:10+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"590540852","name":"Abdul Shakoor Motiwala","type":"user","offset":6,"length":22}]},{"id":"578175918900229","from":{"name":"Abdul Shakoor Motiwala","id":"590540852"},"message":"How kind of you hakka red emperor, your service n ambiance was pretty good.

Now the portions were extremely generous. But the food was extremely horrid. The rice in egg fried was of some really cheap quality. The spicy beef had an OK sauce but the beef was very bland and had absolutely no taste whatsoever. We took one bite of prawn and that's that. They were rubbery! Even the sauce was taste less. The last nail in the coffin was they served us soft drinks in the damn 250ml(or 300 I am not sure) bottles.

Called around 7 to make a reservation and even though I ran about 15 mins late, they called back to confirm if we are coming. The ambiance was nice, although they shud turn the AC up a notch. The service was above par, and the service sizes were delightfully large (even the half plates! )\n\nWe ordered chicken corn soup (my fav) and red hot n sour. The chicken corn was dull and bland but the hot n sour was really good, hit right at the taste buds and was spicy. \n\nIn the main course, ordered Cherry Chilli chicken, kung pao , american chopsuey and schezwan. Cherry chilli chicken was ordinary, and felt almost as if it was cooked in ketchup. Schezwan was much better, a little spicier and had a nice Pakistani touch to it. Kung Pao chicken, now that was good chinease food, felt a lil tingy, looked and felt right at home there. The chopsuey cud also need a lil bit more flavour.\n\nAlso ordered mint lemonade, althu it had more mint than lemon in it and made it very \"disturbing\" to drink, but the pinacolada was very refreshing. In the end, their CC machine was down and we had to pay cash.

I must acknowledge that Hassan Baweja personally looked into the matter and had the courtesy to call up and make amends and assured that we wont have such an unpleasant experience... \n\nDecided to give them a second chance and I was pleasantly surprised...\n\nWent with a friend for lunch today around quarter past one.. After being welcomed and seated we were quick to place our order (prawn balls, prawn chilli dry and crispy Beijing beef) since we were really hungry as always... Unfortunately I could not even touch the beef due to an aggrevated medical condition...  \n\nThe starters were served within 7 minutes and the main course within 15-20 minutes ..Food has never been a complain and as always it was fresh and hot. Hungry we were so quickly finished the meal and during the meal the on-duty manager served us mint lemonade on the house which was fairly refreshing... \n\nSince we were running on the clock didnt have time for dessert. Got the bill at the right time this time round..loll... We were two satisfied customers and this time will definitely go back. Infact, I might be popping in with my friend who I went with last time fairly soon... \n\nOne piece of advice: Ensure that the quality of food is always consistent and the good service needs to be a regular feature as well.

Mirage is the only buffet themed restaurant at Do-Darya and is located right next to Kolachi. The ambience is nothing to write about as it?s almost the same as Kolachi, Charcoal, etc. We booked the whole upper deck unanimously for the view and later regretted the decision as the main food stations were downstairs.\nThe food stations are divided into 3 areas. The main food station is at the entrance while the BBQ section is at the upper left corner of the restaurant. The dessert and salad bar is in the top right corner.\nFor the price (Rs. 1000 per person inclusive of 1 soft drink) the food was very good. There were fresh batair?s (better than Lal-Qila?s), fried prawn tempura, Chicken Biryani, Goan Fish Curry, Chapli Kabab, pani puri are just some of the dishes that were tasted. The highlights however were the BBQ and the live chicken Karhai. The BBQ consisted of Chicken Malai Boti, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Chicken Tikka and Beef Namkeen Boti. The Malai Boti was succulent (but a little sweet for my taste) while Reshmi Kabab and Tikka were awesomely cooked (and Thank God not overcooked)  bu the Beef Namkeen Boti stole the show as it literally melted in our mouths.\nThe Karhai also has 4 varieties namely Peneer White, Peshawari Red, Green Masala and Namkeen Red Karhai. All four varieties were delicious and much better than what Kolachi serves.\nThe let down at Mirage were the salad and dessert station due to same variety as other buffets and also fried fish and the pasta dishes.\nOverall we really enjoyed our food and had a fantastic evening. Best part was that there was no hassle from the waiters or the mangers to clear the table (like they do at Kolachi & Ginsoy).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-27T18:52:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T09:29:10+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"736425186","name":"Maryam Zahoor Ansari"},{"id":"772910592","name":"Shyam Sunder"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"100000226962956","name":"Sumiaya Arif"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"711050864","name":"Abdul Raheem Khan"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"NzM2NDI1MTg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"548935991824222","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Aaquib Arif","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-27T21:28:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"549210141796807","from":{"name":"Zarfras Siddiki","id":"100003898006618"},"message":"seems they(Kolachi and Ginsoy) are quite busy in their business and they care for walk in customers,to avoid waiting in queue,,caring for customers by Kolachi and Ginsoy thats good,,","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T08:19:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549233218461166","from":{"name":"Muhammed Umer Mulla","id":"595408686"},"message":"Well yes but what if you are in thr middle of a meal and the bill is presented to you or when you try to relax the waiter constantly remind you to clear the table as they have a big cue....I mean can't they wait for say 5 mins","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T09:48:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549380488446439","from":{"name":"Sumiaya Arif","id":"100000226962956"},"message":"I second that muhammed umer mulla","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T14:42:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549876995063455","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"5-7 Mins should be max before which the Bill sould be asked for & settled.

Went to Ginsoy extension last Saturday with a friend around 2:30sh. Called in to reserve but the reservation wasnt made, but since it was just two of us so luckily didnt have to wait. Placed our order right away coz both of us were extremely hungry. Ordered Prawn Balls as appetizers, Large portion of Prawn chilli dry and a medium portion of Kung Pao Chicken. \n\nFirst the good....The quality of food was excellent and by the end of it we were stuffed and could not possibly have another bite.... Thats one reason I will go back...\n\nNow the bad....We got our appetizers in 25 minutes and on inquiring why it took so long they come up with the excuse that \"sir yeh tau sab fresh banta hai\", as if other restaurants serve re-heated food maybe? Instead of the prawn chilli dry they got chicken chilli dry and tried to convince me that it was fish...As soon as we dug in our main course the waiter comes up and hands us the bill... I was like \"What..!\" So then he got all uncomfortable and went back... While we were in the middle of lunch one of the \"managers\" comes up and says \"Sir aap ko yahan say hatna PARAY GA\"... My friend was like Excuse me... and then they tell us they have a reservation of twenty people.. My friend goes like well thats not really our problem especially considering you got our order wrong and made us wait another 15- 20 minutes... \nI actually started losing it and to add fuel to the fire they sent up the reservation of 20 upstairs so that we would make a move..So my friend got up and started asking the manager about what is going on to which he had the audacity to say \"Tau kya main iss reservation ko APNAY SAR pay bithaon ga\". I swear to God it was his lucky day that my friend was fairly cool minded and the so called manager didn't say that to me otherwise consequences would have been bad... Now unfortunately it was a huge group of ladies and we didn't feel right in making them wait furthermore, to which we found out that they got their reservation wrong as well coz apparently they had booked for Saturday and they noted it down for Sunday... So we asked the waiter to pack our food, but two of the ladies were nice enough to finish our meal and then leave, but ofcourse we couldn't do that.. \nWe paid our bill downstairs and the last nail in the coffin was that they didn't get all of the things we got packed and go like \"acha aap ko sab chahiye tha\"... \n\nOn our way out one of the managers downstairs apologised profusely but once u leave a bitter taste its hard to recover..\nWhen in the service industry one can't afford such goofups no matter how much pressure there is.. The food and service needs to be equally good.. Seems like the booming success of Ginsoy has gone to their heads and they need to come down a couple of notches before it gets too late.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-18T18:23:50+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T07:50:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"537640231","name":"Zara Gulabo Makhdoom"},{"id":"515251346","name":"Adnan Nazim"},{"id":"633231978","name":"Iqbal G Hussain"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"614385745","name":"Amber Haque"},{"id":"602590206","name":"Ariya Patel"},{"id":"219000363","name":"Deen Sheikh"},{"id":"600144971","name":"Khawaja Zee"},{"id":"649390400","name":"Amber Zulfiqar"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"286700230","name":"Umair Shafi Afzal"},{"id":"860945273","name":"Erum S Rahim"},{"id":"568861941","name":"Hassan Ahmed"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"},{"id":"553586655","name":"Ambreen Intizar"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"753811545","name":"Atiya Abbas"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzUzODExNTQ1","before":"NTM3NjQwMjMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"542850962432725","from":{"name":"Atiya Abbas","id":"753811545"},"message":"seems like nothing went right for them, terrible service","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-18T18:50:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"542851452432676","from":{"name":"Sharmeen Merchant","id":"765975396"},"message":"The service is pathetic.

We even had some leftovers. \n\nGreat service and good food, so i was happy when i left :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-20T21:19:31+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-20T21:19:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000002335877","name":"Zaheer Baweja"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA1OTkwMTU1","before":"MTAwMDAwMDAyMzM1ODc3"}}},"restaurantName":"Ginsoy"},{"id":"165861103465048_542558142462007","from":{"name":"Hero Tastea","id":"100004512521990"},"message":"How about a Peach milk tea with Original boba?\n\nGet your Tastea now from Port Grand, Hobnob Express (Dolmen Mall), Xander?s Caf?, Ginsoy OR at your doorstep via Urbanite.pk.

We ordered Chicken Corn Soup, Chicken in Oyster Sauce and Kung Pao Chicken, and all 3 tasted identical. And by identical, I mean they tasted of nothing. Literally.

First place where I've actually had a salad that has rocket in it and the good parmesan in it. It was so peppery and fresh and crisp that I didn't need the dressing with it! Which was served in a separate container, and barely there dressing. I would suggest to at least half-fill the container with dressing, kanjooson! :p Unfortunately, I had the pizza cold, and since I was too tired to reheat it, I ate it cold, but even then, it was most satisfactory, simply because the crust was devoid of oil, as usual, and the beef and jalapeno combination with the diced tomatoes was bee-yoo-tee-full.

Though the food was good as always, it was a horrible experience otherwise. First of all, the person that took the order was least bothered and seemed half asleep to me actually which turned out true later on. Though I spelled out the name of the street to him twice, he still got the address wrong and which resulted in the food coming after over an hour and a half hour instead of 45 minutes. And when I called after over an hour to ask where the food is, the guy was still completely least bothered and said it'll be there soon and it got there after a further half hour. When we opened the bag, we discovered the sauces had not been tied with a rubber band and had exploded, soaking all the boxes. Furthermore, they got the order wrong by giving us chicken with almonds and pineapple instead of chicken with baby corn and mushrooms.

The only reason we ended up going there was because we called Ginsoy at 9pm, and they said we could check-in at 11pm and would be sure to find a place.. went there at 11pm. No place available. Disappointment #1. As a backup, we called Kolachi at 10pm, they said that if we wanted to reserve a table.. they expect us to go all the way to Phase 8 and get our name written which would result in us getting a table 1 hour AFTER the name was written. Disappointment # 2. So we went to Charcoal, and were HIGHLY disappointed. We ordered Hot & Sour soup and Mozarella sticks from the starters, Chicken Lasange, Ultimate Double Chicken, Jalapeno Burger, Chicken Peshawari, Tarragon Chicken and one more steak. EVERYTHING WAS SO BAD! Also, our food was cold. My brother got the Jalapeno Burger AFTER everyone was already done eating.

But then again along with the cutlery, food presentation not being fancy (which is fine when you?re paying lesser than your fine dining restaurants) does the food quality have to be so poor as well? \n  \nSo here is my review as was agreed by the 8 out of 10 people with me. \n  \nWe had a reservation for 10:30 for 10 people, we got there for about 10:35 had to wait 15 mins for our table to get ready. \n  \nOrdered Hot and sour soup, prawn tempura and garlic chicken wings for starters. The wings were nice (a friend suggested I however did not try them so cant comment) the tempura were ok the soup would have been great had there not been the over powering taste of coriander (am I getting it wrong or has coriander always been an ingredient in a Hot and Sour soup?). \n  \nFor mains, we played safe and ordered Vegetable fried rice, mix chow mein, chicken in black bean sauce, beef with vegetables and STIR fry beef with broccoli (STIR fry just to mention again) and Chicken with mushroom and oyster sauce. The chicken with black bean sauce was edible but nothing great, the STIR fry beef with broccoli was as a friend put it ?Beef Broccoli salan? I mean wouldn?t STIR fry mean a dry dish and not one with a thick grey gravy where the broccoli is floating? Whereas the beef in the Beef with vegetables tasted like the ?gosht (used to indicate desi taste of meat) of an aloo gosht salan that may be slightly undercooked. \n  \nThe service was far beyond SLOW, not once were we asked if our food was ok or if we needed anything we had to call out atleast 2 times for each extra thing that we needed. We were served rice and 2 mins later the chicken with black bean sauce and after a good 7 mins and a mention to the manager we were served our other dishes minus the chicken with mushroom and oyster sauce. \n  \nI mean was it a bad day for Ginsoy or do my taste buds and service expectations (along with the majority of our table) need fixing?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-13T08:11:54+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-13T18:40:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"508353910","name":"Asma Uzair Warsi"},{"id":"612365902","name":"Uzma Jahangir"},{"id":"525331281","name":"Ilyas Shaikh"},{"id":"100003681493822","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"100001770091484","name":"Maria Tahir-Shah"},{"id":"100000349262919","name":"Fiza Khuhro"},{"id":"740390246","name":"Jahanzeb Jahangir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQwMzkwMjQ2","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"423701461014343","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100003681493822"},"message":"i dont like ginsoy food too..i totally agree with u just bcause its light on pocket i wouldnt eat a below average meal.i went there once,service below average,food has never wanted me to go back again.though a couple of times few friends have suggested to go n dine there i have given other alternate suggestions to go to ..i wondered if i was the only one...lol","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-13T08:19:13+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423701787680977","from":{"name":"Aiza Khawaja","id":"506031208"},"message":"You're not the only one !

If you cannot do that, then you should not make plans for that restaurant and certainly avoid negative comments because they could not accommodate your reservation. Just FYI, I feel that way about Okra and therefore rarely think about it as an option for us to dine out. However, that does not take away from the fact that it is a very  respected and highly complimented eatery!

If you cannot do that, then you should not make plans for that restaurant and certainly avoid negative comments because they could not accommodate your reservation. Just FYI, I feel that way about Okra and therefore rarely think about it as an option for us to dine out. However, that does not take away from the fact that it is a very  respected and highly complimented eatery! I freely admit that our plans rarely happen that far in advance, nor am I willing to change our generally spontaneous style of eating out.

Reached at 10:15 and the place was packed with lots of people waiting and it just kept getting worse, the fellow at the counter said my name and number wasn't written down and they take reservations till 7 and the guy on the phone must have said it just like that. Seriously? Then he said we should wait for 15 minutes and we'll get a table, there was a problem with someone else s reservation too, where they wrote the wrong name by mistake. Anyways kept waiting, 30 minutes passed and the guy at the counter just kept delaying the time and disappeared and sent someone else to handle the people and that person was equally confused.

Due to the fact that we had had to stand for 40 mins waiting for a table (which was even after that sad bc we still left without having had food there) a day before we reserved in advance. While we were eating we were presented with the bill. Since we hadn't asked for it we we quite surprised and told the server we would pay....once we had eaten! When we finished two waiters descended upon our table and in seconds cleared it and we asked the leftovers to be packed. This is when we realized we did not have a car outside and called for it. In this time we thought we would have dessert. Upon our asking the server for the dessert menu we were handed the 'bill' again and told by the server 'I am not telling u but requesting you to pay the bill and leave' in these exact words. Now what do u think of that? When we said since we were not freeloaders and wanted the dessert menu we were told 'sorry but I cannot give that. To you'. Hmm...we asked for the head waiter and complained and later on spoke to their manager too. But can you imagine ever being told by the server he is requesting u to leave or saying he cannot give u the menu to order more?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-22T07:38:13+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-25T09:03:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000522564819","name":"Imran Bahadur"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"},{"id":"1217825131","name":"Shahzad Mehr"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTIxNzgyNTEzMQ\u003d\u003d","before":"MTAwMDAwNTIyNTY0ODE5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"402041189847037","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"*Jaw drop* Whaaaattttt? :O","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-22T07:41:27+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"402042129846943","from":{"name":"Fauzia Kazmi","id":"742240544"},"message":"And all this was because they had reserved our table for another group thinking 'we would be done by then'. :( tragic because the food is great.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-22T07:44:42+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"402042519846904","from":{"name":"Shahzad Mehr","id":"1217825131"},"message":":(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-22T07:46:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"402043549846801","from":{"name":"Azmeah Khan","id":"852865161"},"message":"Nazia yup it's so true.....isn't it shocking......ufff never hav I witnessed such rudeness of staff.....khanay kA Mazda kharaab kar Diya :(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-22T07:50:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"402044886513334","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Oh, no!

My dad called around 7:30 p.m. for reservations, but they said they had no tables available. Then, Dad asked for a gentleman who he knows there (I feel like I should keep his identity private for protection :p), and was reassured that a table will be reserved from him. So here's another place where phawwa works. We got there around 8ish, and were taken upstairs. My first time dining in at Ginsoy, and I gotta tell ya, we loved it! There were four people including myself, the 'rents and my aunt. The prawn crackers and green chutney came first, which were a bit cold, but otherwise yum. We ordered the hot and sour soup, butterfly prawns and spring rolls. The soup came along relatively quickly, and it was enough for 8 people. No joke. Delicious, as always. Then came the appetizers simultaneously. The spring rolls were delicious, and the dipping sauce with them was nice too. The butterfly prawns unfortunately, were pretty tough to cut into and chew, and had a mild fishy smell. I had two bites of that and left it. Once the soup and appetizer dishes were cleared away and the dinner plates set out, we waited a good while, which I didn't time, since I was in good company and I seriously needed that space to let the soup settle a little. I seriously wouldn't have been able to eat otherwise. Along came my favorite, the American chop suey, followed by the cherry chilli chicken, vegetable fried rice, chicken with mushrooms in oyster sauce and kung pao chicken. The servings were ginormous, each thing better than the last, but my favorite has got to be the chop suey. However, halfway into the meal, my father and I started feeling the after-effects of MSG. Uh-oh! We'd forgotten to ask them to avoid using that, but it seemed as if the amount used was very less since our reactions weren't as painful as they usually are. The bill was ridiculously inexpensive for our entire meal, specially for the servings and quality of food. Leftovers for me for tomorrow! Yay, Ginsoy!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-21T18:56:01+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-21T19:09:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"562192428","name":"Mehr Azeem"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA4ODc0NDI2NQ\u003d\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"401741583210331","from":{"name":"Kh Taha Saeed","id":"508974845"},"message":"Seriously ....tum bahut zyada farigh ho !!!!!!!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-21T18:58:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"401741933210296","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Dant jaallluussss.

Our reservation was for 2:15pm. 5 of us reached on time and ordered the starters and soups. 4 of us were so called detained (by their kids) and reached around 2:50pm. The manager made such a big hue and cry in an elevated voice that why people at our table had not turned up? I was so offended and wanted to leave that instant but my friends calmed me down and found it too inconvenient to change locations as the rest of my friends were on the way. I admit we were partially at fault but this kind of treatment for higher turnovers is unacceptable. People sit and smoke at tables, chat etc when they finish their meals. The whole idea is to enjoy the day/night out and NOT stuff our mouths and leave so the next lot can do the same. Oh and the food was nothing to write home about. The atmosphere was poor; it was too loud, waiters bumped into our chairs and the rude manager gave us the eyeball.\n\nSecond experience\nLiving in Khi we dont give up easy. So I was craving chinese and my hubby wanted to try out somewhere new than our usual. So I said ok lets give Ginsoy another chance; but lets order in this time. Luck has it, they messed up my order I paid for Crispy(rubber textured) Prawns and they crispy (rubber) delivered Fish. When I called them up to complain they dint make it easy for me. When I asked them to deliver my prawns they mentioned it atleast 5 times not to touch the fish and return it as if we couldnt be trusted!! The delivery guy asked us to show us both so he was sure that we were not wrong! And when he saw no tails on the fish he left. I wish I had just handed him both and told him to getlost. \n It was so humilliating and I am so pissed! And boy was I dissapointed with the doughy rubbery prawns they delivered. \nThis restaurant really needs to get their act together.\n\nNEVER AGAIN","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T17:49:10+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-15T17:45:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"611720320","name":"Quratulaien Tanveer"},{"id":"809891464","name":"Julie Haris"},{"id":"681575742","name":"Samreen Sistanwala"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"515193342","name":"Mesam Akhter"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"501356389","name":"Ammara Haque"},{"id":"507428445","name":"Yasir Khan"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA5ODQwOTE3MQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NjExNzIwMzIw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397403113644178","from":{"name":"Bisma Patel","id":"877870480"},"message":"My first and last experience at Ginsoy was not good, either.

Have also left out Aylanto and Fuchsia that used to be on my favorites list for a long time because of late their quality has deteriorated. So here's the list in my order of preference: \n1.

It was empty but we were refused a place for two as all the seats were reserved, around 3 more couples came in front of us and all were turned down. The people who booked their table for 7:30 arrived at 7:48 or 7:50. Now I know, I have no right to talk about the rule of a restaurant, but as a customer, I am a bit disappointed with the rule. Ginsoy is a small place with around 6 tables on the ground floor and 9 tables on the 1st floor, the rule should be first come first served basis. I was really upset, I mean you go all the way from North Nazimabad, just to get this, and this is not the first time, it happened before too with and with my parents, with me n my friends. We had to order take away, as we came from as they say the other side of bridge!! We placed are order at 7:45 and it came at around 8:15, so yeah we had to wait. All the things we ordered were good, except the rice as they were bland, no salt, no soya, just veggies and plain boiled rice.

The only difference was that we HAD called for reservation, and were told that they dont take reservations and would accommodate us. We were turned down when we got there although there were vacant tables available. Yes they had reservations for half an hour or 45 minutes later.. But this ruined our weekend, because we did not have reservations anywhere else, and knocked at three more restaurants' doors before finally finding a table at Deli. Had we known at 6:00 pm that Ginsoy would not accommodate us, we would've made reservations elsewhere. Anyways, I have a suggestion for Ginsoy.. Of the 15 or 16 tables that they have, they should reserve 10 at any time and let the rest be filled by walk-ins. Clearly they have a decent flow of walk-ins, which ensures that they would still be fully packed.

It seemed that despite 3 people managing the table they could not somehow organize themselves. However the worst bit came in the end. A group of recent college graduates we were chirpy group but that does not mean we get accused for paying less! When we paid our bill the server who miscalculated the cash in his hand came to our table accusing us for paying less! One of my friends Hassaan AY politely asked him to recount the cash and it was discovered that he missed a 500rs note 400rs from which was his tip! It was weird being accused without reason!

To start of with its more in line with desi chinese kind of like some of the better chinese eateries off Tariq Road.  We started with the white hot & sour which was surprisingly good.  Then for the starters we had a couple of ducks and some fried prawn starters.  Both need to be really improved?the duck came with some variation of chapati rather than the chinese pancakes :-( The spring onions, cucumbers, and carrots(don't ask why), tasted pretty stale.  The prawn were really bad too?completely dry and tasteless and chewy.  Then came the main courses.  The fish am not sure of the name was pretty bad as well but the dry beef chill and orange chicken were really good.  The chow main was also really good but desi style.  I also liked the toffee banana with vanilla ice cream.  What I would like to give a special mention to was the young kid who is the proprietor of the place.  He came and asked about the food was extremely polite and took the feedback extremely well.  We need more people like him who don't get defensive and smile back and say next time they will strive to do better.  Two thumbs up to him.  But that said they need to completely redo the duck, the prawns, and the fish.  The comment I would like to end with is on the prices?.the prices were extremely good value for money and came to something around Rs.800 per head minus the duck and we really ordered a lot of food!!!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-02-04T14:14:26+0000","updated_time":"2012-02-05T13:48:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"100000374500079","name":"Misbah Nizami"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"516846714","name":"Haris Rahman Dittu"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"NTg0NjgyMjQz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"310521872332303","from":{"name":"Farah Mirza Afridi","id":"620677462"},"message":"I'd like to add to that Ziad...

The fried bananas (which are my favorite abroad) were also bland and honestly I've never seen a full banana fried and served before! Smaller pieces should be prepared and then served. Also we thought the prawns were actualy chicken cutlets with a prawn tail stuck to them. Lastly the music. Very few restaurants seem to get this right and play what the owner/employees like to listen to. I realy don't want to hear 'Dynamite' in a chinese restaurant. Pls put some instrumental music on. Not necesarily shrill chinese opera but I'm sure there are great oriental fusion melodies available.But the decor was nice and cheerful. Staff was very polite and accomadating. The red fish and noddles were yummy. And the owner was a very sweet, eager young guy who I hope will take this feedback as positive coz I would like to return for another meal :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-04T14:44:25+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"310541845663639","from":{"name":"Misbah Nizami","id":"100000374500079"},"message":"Ziad thxs for the detailed feedback was thinking of eating there!

So, for 3 people, we ordered the following:\n\n* Chicken Corn Soup (I know, not many people order the classic Chicken Corn Soup, neither do we, but mother just insisted) - We ordered the large serving of the soup, and it was exactly 3 bowls of soup. No more, no less. Yes it was stated already in the menu that it serves 2-3 people, but the Ginsoy - Extreme Chinese fan in us thought there'd be more. Not at all a disappointment though, by any means. It was exactly what Chicken Corn Soup needs to be. Small little bits, but sufficient, of chicken, adequate amount of corn. The soup was just what it was supposed to be.\n\n* Wasabi Prawns for appetizers - The prawns were remarkably done. They had that wasabi-kick in them which was needed to give that \"buzz\" feel you want to have when eating a Wasabi Prawn. Yet again, there were 5 prawns in total, dot. Tastewise: Brilliant.\n\n* Fish Milano (my main) - Their Fish Milano was intended to be  a large fried fillet of fish placed delicately over a bed of green-herbs sauce and coated with cheese served with rice (as understood from the menu). It was exactly as described. I needed something cheesy and rich, and it definitely delivered. The fish was nicely done; flaky, properly fried, the type that just wants you to keep eating it. The green sauce under the fish was generous in quantity, but didn't quite have much of a \"burst of flavors\" that I was hoping for. But the cheese on top took care of that. All in all, a 7/10\n\n* Fish with Jalapeno *something*, mum's main (apologies for not remembering the complete name) - A similar sized fish to mine, fried as nicely as mine was, sat on the plate with sauteed vegetables, a serving of rice, and a small little bowl/cup containing the sauce for this dish. This sauce however, did have a distinctive taste to it. I actually borrowed some of it to use on my fish as well. The one thing common in the 2 mains was that the steamed rice that were served with them were simply the best ever steamed rice I've ever had in my life. The rice had an amazing feel to them in the mouth that is probably inexplicable, yet noticeable. An 7.5/10\n\n* Black Pepper Chicken and Garlic Rice, sold separately (father's main) - Hands down, the highlight of the day. Never have I tasted Black Pepper Chicken done so beautifully crafted in terms of flavor. And the Garlic Rice were \"actually\" Garlic Rice, not a joke in the name of garlic. You could just bring the bowl of rice close to your nostrils and know for a fact how nicely the garlic was incorporated in the rice. Father won, simple. Would definitely give 8.5/10\n\nWe ordered 3 drinks to go with the meal: Mint Julep, Blue Margarita, Peach *something*. In terms of the quantity of the drinks, father (Mint Julep) won again. Then mum (Peach *something) and then me. Again.\nThe experience, in terms of cozy sitting, soothing music being played in the background (rather than some pop/rap/hip-hop artist blaring) and most importantly, taste, was great. Definitely a place I'd go over and over again.\nThe only problem that I have is that the portions could be slightly bigger, because when you pay about Rs. 5000 for a meal of 3, you sort-of expect to be filled to the hilt. But it wasn't so. But it was 5000 bucks well-spent for taste. Definitely well-spent if \"taste\" was (and mostly, it is) meant to be the star. I would just say, if they could slightly beef up their quantity too, it'll do wonders.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-12T03:34:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-12T20:01:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1352533620","name":"Sakina Nanabhai"},{"id":"1088748635","name":"Aqsa Shah"},{"id":"1241948621","name":"Nayab Shakil"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"100002608457065","name":"Haroona Khawar"},{"id":"100001249191882","name":"Fozia Amjad"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"628495513","name":"Fariha Harris"},{"id":"617371190","name":"Samar Mughal"},{"id":"100001697508377","name":"Hira Qazi"},{"id":"550700453","name":"Ammar Amjad"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1202678003","name":"Aisha Naayaab Rao"},{"id":"614747510","name":"Tariq Hameed Siddiqui"},{"id":"100001419761223","name":"Imran Malik"},{"id":"756768261","name":"Muhammad Aslam"},{"id":"535065551","name":"Hassan Khan"},{"id":"789225723","name":"Lalarukh Khursheed Farooqui"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM4MjM2MTI1Ng\u003d\u003d","before":"NTA4OTIyNTA5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"648625911855229","from":{"name":"Sajjad Ahmed","id":"1382361256"},"message":"well described!thanks....but 5000 rupees too much!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-12T04:35:05+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"648630128521474","from":{"name":"Ehtesham Maqbool","id":"189100160"},"message":"Nice detailed review.

As we ate it we kept turning to each other and saying things like \"wow, yum, mmm!\" The food was all fresh & spicy. Anyhow, I did not find the hot & sour soup (red) satisfying.

However we'd like to clarify a couple of things. Firstly we are not in the market to compete with Ginsoy. We have no comparison with Ginsoy as they're serving Extreme Chinese and we're serving Hakka Chinese. Hakka Chinese is a distinct cuisine of Chine which is acquainting the market, at the moment. The names may be similar to our competitors but we're solely striving for our identity and not being a substitute for other eateries. The prices have been set to what matches our costing and market, nor an 'at par' comparison with Ginsoy. There is nothing 'wannabe' about it if our ambiance depicts the name we've given to our eatery. We're serving food to please customers like you and that would remain our first and foremost priority.

The disappointing part was the main course apparently the thai chow mien means a spicier version of Chinese chow mien. Than the real disappointment I am sure almost anyone been to Ginsoy must have had the cherry chilli chicken so I ordered it in RE as well there was no gravy it was fried dry chicken and instead of canned cherries or fresh cherries they had used the sugary type of cherries that you use in cakes which gave the whole dish a very weird sweetish kick. \n\nService was also good something Teamginsoy Ginsoy needs to take a lesson from as when in rush hours the service is not upto the mark.\n\nPricing was also similar to Ginsoy you can have half portions as well but that makes me question if I want Chinese why not go to Ginsoy ?","type":"status","created_time":"2013-06-28T09:40:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-06-29T14:52:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d","before":"MjgxMTc5MjI\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"577638808953940","from":{"name":"Sana Abdullah","id":"627747302"},"message":"For service and ambiance.
