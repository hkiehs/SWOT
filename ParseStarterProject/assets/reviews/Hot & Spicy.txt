I absolutely love there burgers (ordered Cordon Chicken Burger), they are big juicy and fulfilling! Wife had Chicken Quesadilla and loved it, what was left I had it late night. The chicken strips were a little dry, though the sauce that accompanied it made up for it. A good 10% discount on the bill was very generous of Tahir Wahid (did not ask for it). A great experience over all.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-10T13:53:48+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-11T13:13:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002179095447","name":"Ijlal Wajahat"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"543405800","name":"Tahir Wahid"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"761955340","name":"Ghulam Mustafa Hasni"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA3NjI4NTIxNQ\u003d\u003d","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"411341105583712","from":{"name":"Tahir Wahid","id":"543405800"},"message":"glad that u like the food, if it is possible y dont u come on dine in? i m sure ur small complains would be solved too, hope to see u soon, TC.......","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-10T21:12:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"411501595567663","from":{"name":"Aamir Basrai","id":"500293260"},"message":"I have heard alot of good things about Grilled Chillez, where exactly is it? would like to try it out before ramzan!

When people started being negative about Aylanto, I wanted to give them another chance to see if it was really that bad now. Our first experience at the new place was a C+ so I could not understand the horrible reviews they were getting. So, being a glutton for punishment, I took Mariyam Masood there for lunch today. Sigh, what can I say that it was a complete and utter disappointment! First, the positives. Good greeting at the door, polite waiters, cold water, fresh bread and courteous damage control. Unfortunately that is where it stops! Ordered the French Onion soup which actually was not too bad the last time but microscopic cheese on two pieces of french bread thrown in at the last minute so they were hard. When I sent it back, because at the time of the order I specified that I wanted it to be smothered in melting cheese, it returned with some additional grated but unmelted cheese. Strike One! Mariyam's Tarragon Chicken, which she loved at the old Aylanto, was two skinny pieces of chicken unable to really remain juicy or retain flavour. Strike Two! My steak was ordered medium rare and came medium well. Was replaced with one that was more like medium but by then I did not want to waste any more time or food and dutifully ate the average tasting steak. Strike Three! To their credit, one of their managers came to check when he had been told I was unhappy with our food and I shared my concerns with him. He was very apologetic and despite my repeated requests to the contrary, removed the soup and steak from the bill ... which made me very uncomfortable since that was not my intent in speaking with him. I told him that they really need to focus on their food if they are to stem the negative tide and he was receptive to the feedback. He requested that we return and he would personally take charge of our orders. However, unfortunately that is not what we want from any restaurant. Sure, people do take care of us at places we go to but then that is in their nature for ALL their customers, not just us. Overall, being a charitable person, I hope that they can return to the standards of yesteryear because at the moment, I find it very hard to point myself in the direction of Aylanto again. And that is a damn shame since I did enjoy my occasional visits there. The top management and owners have to take charge and do something because even a blind guy like me can see the problems screaming at me! Sorry Aylanto, I really am. I wanted to be positive and see hope but since things are sliding since my last visit, there is genuine cause for concern.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-04T10:18:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-04T18:07:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"603103229","name":"Danish Munir"},{"id":"698366264","name":"Ahsan R.
