The concept is novel, providing a diverse menu, better service, and relatively premium items, compared to the standard quetta hotels/dhabba.\n\nTried the Masala Chai.  Well, it was just chai, nothing really special about it -- and neither does the taste justify the price premium.  Similarly, there are other better options for Saada Chai as well.  The tea menu is interesting, and it will be great if the management (which I think is on these food groups) provides a description of the teas on the menu as well.\n\nThe menu also had various derivatives of the paratha, and we tried the Pizza paratha, Cheese paratha, and Nutella paratha. The parathas overall lacked the layers, and the flakiness associated with parathas served at these dhabas, and isn't really something I'd like to try again, given other better options.  The pizza paratha was basically 'anda on a paratha' which one can have from pretty much any other dhaba.  The Cheese paratha just had a bit of Mozarella on top, which wasn't really complementing the taste of the paratha.  Finally, Nutella paratha tasted good -- BUT its NUTELLA, it is supposed to taste GOOD with EVERYTHING.\n\nOverall, the service was great, but the flavor leaves a lot to be desired.  Will I be ditching Quetta Alamgir, Chai Dhaba, the hotel on the corner of HotSpot, or Quetta Sufyan for this.  I really doubt that.\n\nThe concept is Amazing.  Tweaking the flavor a bit, and the parathas can do wonders for this place (which already is doing really well).\n\nOverall score: 6/10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-07T00:47:09+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-07T04:33:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"619015976","name":"Marium Zubair"},{"id":"504392072","name":"Ali Ahmad"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"501776623","name":"Shayan Shabbir Lakdawalla"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAxNzc2NjIz","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc0MDgxMjMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"599619346755886","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"good review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-07T04:33:31+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTk5NjE5MzQ2NzU1ODg2","before":"NTk5NjE5MzQ2NzU1ODg2"}}},"restaurantName":"Chai Master"},{"id":"165861103465048_597981930252961","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"So last night  decided we wanted to have paratha and omelette for sehri around 1:30 am ..initial thought was BOTs however we decided stick close to home and started our hunt for the food.
