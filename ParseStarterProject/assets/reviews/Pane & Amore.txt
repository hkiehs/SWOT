Was craving like anything for Red Velvets, after some pretty good reccomendations went to Pane & Amore. I must say I'm swiped off my feet. \nThe cupcakes taste so fresh,light and the creme cheese is soo fluffy and unreal a clean and spotless cafe with an amazing staff. I think I'm in cupcake heaven.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-08-16T16:17:06+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-18T12:36:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003660266586","name":"Mariyam Shahjahan"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"100003640081725","name":"Aiman Khalid"},{"id":"594796590","name":"Ufaq Ashfaque"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"566005153","name":"Mansab Uzair"},{"id":"100001882596023","name":"Mansoor Zaheer"},{"id":"599645349","name":"Hamna Haqqi"},{"id":"1058171190","name":"Fahad-Pakistani Zaidi"},{"id":"100000087775469","name":"Arshad Shamsi"},{"id":"100000234977922","name":"Zain Hasan"},{"id":"512000130","name":"Mustafa Masood"},{"id":"100001432075867","name":"Suhaila Tobeh"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"100000299126508","name":"Ahsan Javed"},{"id":"189100160","name":"Ehtesham Maqbool"},{"id":"100005558611444","name":"Rana Arslan"},{"id":"670615540","name":"Khurram Wahab"},{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan"},{"id":"505484337","name":"Mian Saad"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"518470140","name":"Mustafa Chhotani"},{"id":"669320704","name":"Fahad Azad"},{"id":"100003986312537","name":"Shoaib Anwar Junejo"},{"id":"688651656","name":"Amin Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg4NjUxNjU2","before":"MTAwMDAzNjYwMjY2NTg2"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_604088056309015/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjg4NjUxNjU2"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"604090789642075","from":{"name":"DrSyed Farrukh Jamal","id":"749655321"},"message":"Whers this Pane & Amore ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:26:11+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"604091912975296","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Ure lucky u got them....they usually run out of em...but werent they divine??","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:30:09+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"604093022975185","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Behind pink Cadillac.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:34:26+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"604093089641845","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"And omg Soha they were out of the world","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:34:46+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"604094196308401","from":{"name":"Shakeeb Ahmed","id":"516818488"},"message":"Suhaila Tobeh Fahad Hussain","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-16T16:38:28+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100001432075867","name":"Suhaila Tobeh","type":"user","offset":0,"length":13},{"id":"501632029","name":"Fahad Hussain","type":"user","offset":14,"length":13}]},{"id":"604094876308333","from":{"name":"Adnan Afzal","id":"100002014163412"},"message":"How much do they cost Ayesha?

Initial impression: Clean, spare, light and airy. We were on a quick stopover, so 2 Americanos, one cupcake, one order of fries with garlic Mayo. Being the 'quiet zone' Nazi I am, asked the waiter to tone down the music, after which we settled in and sampled their fare. Coffee, taste 7/10, temperature 6/10, presentation 8/10. Fries; taste 8/10, quantity 9/10, presentation 9/10. Chatted with the young owner and got to find out more about the place/pricing/customer profile (its mostly women btw). They offer a discount to Ufone customers who 'check in' on their phone app. Were I resident here in DHA5, would be a repeat customer. Have asked my friend Gypsy Raine Safar to make them a music selection (is there a market for making music lists for restaurants?)

Service through-out was supereb & our 10 orders of meals & coffee were served within 10 mins.\nHowever, the food was strictly ok, we ordered English & Mediterranean Meals with scrambled & fried eggs, pancakes stack with maple and chicken omelette. None of us enjoyed the Mediterranean meal; & the English had nothing especial about them, however my eggs were made perfectly just the way I like 'em. But the Turkey Bacon was dry & chewy and they seriously need to do something with their hash browns dint  taste like hash browns at all & looked like a cross between home-made potato cutlets & Gratin Potatoes. Not Good. I don't like Roasted Tomatoes, dint touch them.\nAlso, how can you not serve butter with bread??! They did serve us loads of it when we asked but it was cold & not at room temperature, the way I like.\nWhile cappuccinos & cold coffee were nice, the triple chocolate ice coffee only had ice, I couldn't taste any chocolate, let only triple choc!!\nTheir cup cakes were perched on the counter tempting us to try them; I wanted to have the red velvet & choc marble ones, but another customer beat me to the race to the counter & we were left with only mint choc & German choc cupcakes and my-oh-my what cup cakes they were, i already love mint choc but the german choc ones made be a believer. I'll go there gain & again, not for the breakfast but for the cupcakes. Divine!!\nThe credit card device was not working but thankfully we were carrying cash. The manager gave us a 15% discount & also offered a 30% discount card [waiting for it to be delivered soon, so that I get discount on cupcakes :)].\nThey now just need to make their food as great as their service.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-16T10:27:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-16T10:30:56+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"533447656","name":"Saniea Akhtar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTMzNDQ3NjU2","before":"NjY1MDkxODIw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"398785953505894","from":{"name":"Syed Zubair Bin Saeed","id":"576972332"},"message":"https://twitter.com/SyedBinSaeed/status/213921788302868480/photo/1","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T10:29:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"398786360172520","from":{"name":"Syed Zubair Bin Saeed","id":"576972332"},"message":"https://twitter.com/SyedBinSaeed/status/213923144623337473/photo/1","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T10:30:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Mzk4Nzg2MzYwMTcyNTIw","before":"Mzk4Nzg1OTUzNTA1ODk0"}}},"restaurantName":"Pane & Amore"},{"id":"165861103465048_385787161472440","from":{"name":"Shafia Agha","id":"650845003"},"message":"Pane & Amore for dinner last night - what a flash in the pan!!!

Now I'll come down to the con's , I was thoroughly disappointed in fact even embarrassed when the waiter at the cafe said that they were outta Froyo (both flavours) and all he could get me was one large cup of chocolate Froyo (We were 5 people we ended up sharing it yes thats pretty sad in itself ) , the part that was disappointing was that it was just 10 pm on a weekend night in Karachi people usually go out to a cafe at that time for dessert and when you end up coming out empty handed its the worst feeling ever. Secondly the flavours for the Froyo were pretty limited Chocolate and Mixed Fruit respectively I think there should be more flavours. We thought of opting for some other desserts then but when we went to check out the dessert window there wasn't much to choose from. I didn't see any of the delicious looking cakes or cupcakes that are posted on the official Upper Crust page anywhere in the cafe. We ended up going to the Hotspot instead and were thoroughly satisfied like always . I am definitely willing to give the place another shot since its a relatively new place and with a really enthusiastic owner it definitely does have potential to improve.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-04T19:33:23+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-07T12:33:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002605916001","name":"Sadaf Munir"},{"id":"603490700","name":"Mariam Bilgrami"},{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njc3Mjk1NTYz","before":"MTAwMDAyNjA1OTE2MDAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"271636166220874","from":{"name":"Maleeha Jawaid","id":"785615314"},"message":"Bilal you're baackkk","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-04T19:43:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"271641302887027","from":{"name":"Bilal Hassan","id":"512386146"},"message":"Yayyy I be back yo","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-04T19:45:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"271653646219126","from":{"name":"De Joe","id":"597535350"},"message":"This was our 15th day, in business.
