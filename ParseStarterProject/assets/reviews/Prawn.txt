It was a successful event and we had a great time meeting new people :)  \n\nFirstly last night was one of the coldest nights by far and I thought we were going to turn into popsicles but thanks to the  management at Sajjad that didn't happen. It was unusually and surprisingly warm. Its covered from all sides and has fires burning at different spots which is really nice. So this answers the question for all who have been seeking a warm spot at do darya.\n\nNow to the FOOD.\nStarters: Chicken Dhakka, Hot and Sour Soup, BBQ prawns, lemon chicken and fish dhakka.\n\nMains: Afghani Boti, Chicken karhai, Shahi Handi.\n\nSTARTERS:\n? Chicken Dhakka: \n The most loved starter off all time I assume. It had been wiped clean off the dish as soon as it hit the table. Boneless chicken fried in a delicious batter served with this amazing sauce. Hands down the best dish on the menu and a must must try.\n\n?Hot & Sour Soup:\nDefiantly has room for improvement. But since we were sitting in a Pakistani themed Resturant i didn't expect a tiny Chinese man dancing out of my soup. So all good.\n\n?BBQ Prawns: \nOk i am not a seafood person at all. So according to the people who ate them they did enjoy. Its a very interesting dish. Plain simple flavours which enhanced the taste of the prawns \n\n?Lemon Chicken:\nAnother of my favorites. YUM i felt like im in chicken heaven. Crunchy chicken fried perfectly packed with that lemon zing. At the same time it didnt over power the chicken.\nI would keep going back for that.\n\n?Fish Dhaka:\nAnother one of the yummi delights. Me not being a sea food person fell for them like i slipped on a banana peel. \nMust try again. A complete winter dish\n\nMAINS:\nWe had stuffed our selfs with the starters lol\n\n?Chicken Karhai:\nJust has a taste but now i know why are they famous for it. Tasted yum.\n\n?Afghani Beef Boti:\nI can keep returning for that every single day. Soft, filled with taste, melts in the mouth. Neither to spicy neither bland just the right amount of spices.\n\n?Shahi Chicken Handi:\nA shahi handi for a shahi gathering lol. \nI love it. Boneless chicken chunks cooked in butter and topped with cheese and hints of fresh herbs. It has that yummy creamy subtle taste. Geez my mouth still waters for it. Total justice to the dish.\n\nOverall: \nGreat service.\nFood arrived hot and on time.\nAttentive staff.\nLoved the plastic covers against the wind. \n\nSpecial thankyou to all the foodies that showed up. \nHope to see u all soon.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-29T14:35:00+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-02T21:31:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"541880374","name":"Noreen Ahmed"},{"id":"100001434743152","name":"Raza Rehmani"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"100003570224157","name":"Kashif Khan"},{"id":"100001356574653","name":"Rude Plannet Kennel Rpk"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"532470690","name":"Sana Zaeem"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"887535136","name":"Jabbar Abdul"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"796000540","name":"Nisa Abdul Basit Khan"},{"id":"100001217752738","name":"MehRose Khan"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"729875068","name":"Soomro Ali"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"733018407","name":"Nabeel Kazi"},{"id":"100002943458913","name":"Aisha Wali Muhammad"},{"id":"1356485615","name":"Samrah Owais"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5MjA0NTUy","before":"MTAwMDA1NDIxODIzNTg4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_674208709296949/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzQ5MjA0NTUy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"674210079296812","from":{"name":"Zohaib Ali Memon","id":"524501080"},"message":"need to make it to one of these some day","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:38:13+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213699296450","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"So who all came?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:10+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213745963112","from":{"name":"Khozema Soni","id":"513558813"},"message":"If this event took place why was that girl siting alone ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:18+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674216695962817","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Khozema Soni well there was a bit of miscommunication.

Comfortable large space, with two storeys (one one is functional for now)\n\nCourteous staff and an attentive chef who came and helped us select our dishes.\n\nThe prawn crackers were fresh and crispy and the three dipping sauces on the table were just divine. \n\nThe two soups ordered were the HOT & SOUR and EIGHT TREASURES. Both were excellent, proper flavourful stock and full of different veggies and mushrooms. I don't think either one had any seafood in it so good for everyone on the table. By the way HUGE servings. One large bowl was good for 6-8 people. And 4 people if they just go for soup. Which I can see my self doing.\n\nThe starters were WASABI PRAWNS, DYNAMITE PRAWNS and CHINESE DRUMSTICKS. Both the prawns were well fried in nice batter. Sauce tasted different and were very nice. For me wasabi can have more of a kick. But great for everyone. The dynamite prawns too could have been spicier but that's an individual palate.\n\nMain course.....HUNAN BEEF, BLACK BEAN SAUCE BEEF, KUNG PAO CHICKEN, FISH IN APPLE SALSA. THE CARBOHYDRATES......CHICKEN CHOWMEIN, CHICKEN FRIED RICE\n\nEach tasted different, was presented well, had distinct flavour. As Luciferz Angel pointed out - the food was neither desiofied nor was it authentic, it was a very well balanced happy medium. Something one can keep going back for again and again.\n\nI am looking forward to my next trip especially for the whole red snapper and to try out the lemon chilie soup.\n\nSince no meal is complete without dessert. We all hopped and skipped (ok drove) to HOTSPOT and had the yummiest ice cream and apple crumble.\n\nAll in all a great meal and a lovely evening with good friends\n\nPS Faisal Naseer will post the food pics.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-27T18:43:04+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-27T21:54:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002364449168","name":"Mansoor Hussain"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"7923343","name":"Usman Moon"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"100006770439612","name":"Rehan Ateq"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzkyNDcwMTcw","before":"MTAwMDAyMzY0NDQ5MTY4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"673327156051771","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Any Prawn Tempura swotties?

Though it was more on the spicy side for me.\n\nI did not try the other one but according to another fellow swottie it was also quite good.\n\nStarters:\nFor starters we had Chicken Drumsticks, Prawn balls and Prawn Toast.\nThe starters were cold initially but after requesting them to change it we were served with fresh hot ones. \nPrawn toast was a personal favorite .\nI found the prawn balls to be quite bland.\nThey being cold ruined the taste for me a bit.\n\nMains:\nFor Mains there was\nChicken Manchurian:\nMy much raved about personal favorite. Was a Disappointment at RE. The CM lacked gravy and was quite dry and too sweet. But had generous amounts of chicken. It was more of a mashed mush rather then a saucy Manchurian.\n\nBeef in Oyester Sauce:\nDefiantly got me going back for more. Was super yum soft and moist. Bit on the oily side though.\n\nVegetable in Coconut Curry:\nTasted okayish. The veggies were cut quite large making it hard to eat.\nThe coconut curry was an interesting blend of flavors though.\n\nVegetable Chowmein:\nAgain I found it quite bland. Nothing to write about.\n\nThere was one more dish I'm forgetting.\n\nDesserts:\nThere was 5 kinds of desserts \nChocolate moose. Cheesecake \nCustard. Fruit chat. Walnut muffins.\n\nThe cheesecake was loved by everyone.\nI personally loved the chocolate moose.\n\nFRUIT CHAT on a Chinese buffet. Like seriously bhai kia chah rahay ho. Iftari thori hai :P \n\nOverall:\nHad an amazing time meeting up with the people who share the similar love for food. \nThe food was quite cold would have appreciated warmer servings.\nFor taste I would give it a 6/10\nChoice of dishes 5/10\n\nService on the other hand was exceptionally good.\nMeeting the owners themselves was quite pleasent.\nLoved our complimentey cups of greentea.\n\nPriced at 1100 per person. And promising 20+ dishes we found it quite disappointing in aspects of choice of dishes and taste.\n\nWould I go back for the buffet? NO.\nWill I go again because of their service at another time perhaps. YES.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-11T12:42:09+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-12T07:45:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"100002901606860","name":"OmEr JuTt"},{"id":"100001082786735","name":"Mahjabeen Khan"},{"id":"739935375","name":"Umer Latif"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"762775146","name":"Syed Faraz Baqar"},{"id":"524501080","name":"Zohaib Ali Memon"},{"id":"1107436825","name":"Xa?id Waqar"},{"id":"577774492","name":"Osamah Nasir"},{"id":"568861941","name":"Hassan Ahmed"},{"id":"1175769579","name":"Mohsin Mohiuddin"},{"id":"612945508","name":"Umair Shabbir"},{"id":"1282983841","name":"Hamza Kapadia"},{"id":"500786387","name":"Durand D'Silva"},{"id":"100000114960083","name":"Irfan Lala"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"100000238497030","name":"Madiiha N Narrejo"},{"id":"733018407","name":"Nabeel Kazi"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"709830622","name":"Saqib Pervez"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzI3NzkxMjA1","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc0MDgxMjMx"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_665038480213972/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzI3NzkxMjA1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"665040426880444","from":{"name":"Muhammad Abdullah","id":"1289258274"},"message":"Throughout the review your praising it but why so less score :p","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:47:02+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665041133547040","from":{"name":"Yasir Billoo","id":"807675696"},"message":"She is mainly praising it cause of the awesome company she was with :D right Ayesha :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:49:10+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha","type":"user","offset":77,"length":6}]},{"id":"665041723546981","from":{"name":"Muhammad Abdullah","id":"1289258274"},"message":"I'm sure, must have been fun.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:50:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665042180213602","from":{"name":"Mazahir Ali","id":"520175866"},"message":"Another cake in the making.... :P","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T12:51:58+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665046013546552","from":{"name":"Fareha Zarsheen","id":"612250309"},"message":"I tried red emperor just once before n didnt like it much.

We were 7 including 2 kids. Safe to say that was starvng and therefore ordered maybe too many starters and subsequently not enough main course but then there is always next time :). \n\nFor starters we ordered Prawn balls, Ginsoy Wraps and Chicken Drum Sticks along with the Thai Soup (the supersize portion they call large) and one order of sweet and sour (white). \n\nLets start with the soup... When a 5 year old drinks a soup and says Yummm... that says enough. One of the best I have had in a long time. The thai was so good that the sweet and sour infact got packed and taken home :).\n\nOf the starters the Wrap was excellent and I wish we had ordered more. The prawn balls were ok and the Chicken wings were also good. Again, if you go there and haven't tried I would recommend the Wraps.\n\nOnto the main course. The Cherry Chilli Chicken and the Spicy Garlic Chicken. I preferred the Cherry Chilli but overall great food. \n\nLet me add that the service was excellent and the staff very friendly... our server was Marison who did an excellent job. \n\nAll in all, a positive experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-27T08:18:01+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-27T10:45:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"502191902","name":"Zaigham Hidayatullah"},{"id":"28117922","name":"Masuma Aftab-Murtaza"},{"id":"638521516","name":"Abdul Ghaffar AG"},{"id":"511168242","name":"Akber Ali Khaliqdina"},{"id":"651674702","name":"Mohsin Baweja"},{"id":"885940595","name":"Ranjenah Bariya"},{"id":"586401160","name":"Ali Sheikh"},{"id":"505056779","name":"Adeel Humayun"},{"id":"1275940201","name":"Noman"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"688747484","name":"Uzair A Kaleem"},{"id":"732459812","name":"Asif Aslam"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"514399693","name":"Arsalan Faruqi"},{"id":"708482342","name":"Saba Basit"},{"id":"515208057","name":"Faizy Farooq"},{"id":"621305514","name":"Aniqa Imran"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjIxMzA1NTE0","before":"NzA1NTMzOTI0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"657927627591724","from":{"name":"Faizy Farooq","id":"515208057"},"message":"i can go to ginsoy again and again and again and again...................... and again.. and still not get bored of the awesome food it has to offer :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:34:56+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"657929180924902","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Great review Shujaat Alavi :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:40:51+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"853165219","name":"Shujaat Alavi","type":"user","offset":13,"length":13}]},{"id":"657932784257875","from":{"name":"Asim Ibrahim","id":"100004366567543"},"message":"location plz.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-27T08:54:23+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"657964200921400","from":{"name":"Saira Danish Ahmed","id":"1116196206"},"message":"I have been to both Ginsoy main and Ginsoy extension.

The serving staff were really helpful & patient with the suggestions/recommendations, & detailed explanations of what each dish (the ones we asked about) on the menu were like.That not only helped us order the correct dishes, but also made us feel at home.\n\n2. For appetizers we ordered the seafood chowder (soup), cream of asparagus and roasted tomato & basil soup. \nThe highlight was the seafood chowder that tasted like nothing else on this planet! Don't have words to explain how much it was busting with flavor...It was love at the very first bite, for each and every one of us!\nThe remaining 2 soups tasted really really good too!\n\n2. Ordered the following for Main Course:\n\n* Seafood Kata Kat (something totally different, and a must for every seafood lover)\n* Prawn Masala (deliciousness personified)\n* Crabs Subzwari (to die for)\n* Grilled Red Snapper with chilli sauce (bohot aala!!)\n*Chicken Tornados (wow)\n\nAmbience & Service: Delightful\nFood Taste & Quality: Unparalleled to any other seafood in town.

So, for 3 people, we ordered the following:\n\n* Chicken Corn Soup (I know, not many people order the classic Chicken Corn Soup, neither do we, but mother just insisted) - We ordered the large serving of the soup, and it was exactly 3 bowls of soup. No more, no less. Yes it was stated already in the menu that it serves 2-3 people, but the Ginsoy - Extreme Chinese fan in us thought there'd be more. Not at all a disappointment though, by any means. It was exactly what Chicken Corn Soup needs to be. Small little bits, but sufficient, of chicken, adequate amount of corn. The soup was just what it was supposed to be.\n\n* Wasabi Prawns for appetizers - The prawns were remarkably done. They had that wasabi-kick in them which was needed to give that \"buzz\" feel you want to have when eating a Wasabi Prawn. Yet again, there were 5 prawns in total, dot. Tastewise: Brilliant.\n\n* Fish Milano (my main) - Their Fish Milano was intended to be  a large fried fillet of fish placed delicately over a bed of green-herbs sauce and coated with cheese served with rice (as understood from the menu). It was exactly as described. I needed something cheesy and rich, and it definitely delivered. The fish was nicely done; flaky, properly fried, the type that just wants you to keep eating it. The green sauce under the fish was generous in quantity, but didn't quite have much of a \"burst of flavors\" that I was hoping for. But the cheese on top took care of that. All in all, a 7/10\n\n* Fish with Jalapeno *something*, mum's main (apologies for not remembering the complete name) - A similar sized fish to mine, fried as nicely as mine was, sat on the plate with sauteed vegetables, a serving of rice, and a small little bowl/cup containing the sauce for this dish. This sauce however, did have a distinctive taste to it. I actually borrowed some of it to use on my fish as well. The one thing common in the 2 mains was that the steamed rice that were served with them were simply the best ever steamed rice I've ever had in my life. The rice had an amazing feel to them in the mouth that is probably inexplicable, yet noticeable. An 7.5/10\n\n* Black Pepper Chicken and Garlic Rice, sold separately (father's main) - Hands down, the highlight of the day. Never have I tasted Black Pepper Chicken done so beautifully crafted in terms of flavor. And the Garlic Rice were \"actually\" Garlic Rice, not a joke in the name of garlic. You could just bring the bowl of rice close to your nostrils and know for a fact how nicely the garlic was incorporated in the rice. Father won, simple. Would definitely give 8.5/10\n\nWe ordered 3 drinks to go with the meal: Mint Julep, Blue Margarita, Peach *something*. In terms of the quantity of the drinks, father (Mint Julep) won again. Then mum (Peach *something) and then me. Again.\nThe experience, in terms of cozy sitting, soothing music being played in the background (rather than some pop/rap/hip-hop artist blaring) and most importantly, taste, was great. Definitely a place I'd go over and over again.\nThe only problem that I have is that the portions could be slightly bigger, because when you pay about Rs. 5000 for a meal of 3, you sort-of expect to be filled to the hilt. But it wasn't so. But it was 5000 bucks well-spent for taste. Definitely well-spent if \"taste\" was (and mostly, it is) meant to be the star. I would just say, if they could slightly beef up their quantity too, it'll do wonders.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-12T03:34:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-12T20:01:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1352533620","name":"Sakina Nanabhai"},{"id":"1088748635","name":"Aqsa Shah"},{"id":"1241948621","name":"Nayab Shakil"},{"id":"513228889","name":"Ramlah Seraj Sheharyar"},{"id":"100002608457065","name":"Haroona Khawar"},{"id":"100001249191882","name":"Fozia Amjad"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"628495513","name":"Fariha Harris"},{"id":"617371190","name":"Samar Mughal"},{"id":"100001697508377","name":"Hira Qazi"},{"id":"550700453","name":"Ammar Amjad"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"1202678003","name":"Aisha Naayaab Rao"},{"id":"614747510","name":"Tariq Hameed Siddiqui"},{"id":"100001419761223","name":"Imran Malik"},{"id":"756768261","name":"Muhammad Aslam"},{"id":"535065551","name":"Hassan Khan"},{"id":"789225723","name":"Lalarukh Khursheed Farooqui"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM4MjM2MTI1Ng\u003d\u003d","before":"NTA4OTIyNTA5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"648625911855229","from":{"name":"Sajjad Ahmed","id":"1382361256"},"message":"well described!thanks....but 5000 rupees too much!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-12T04:35:05+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"648630128521474","from":{"name":"Ehtesham Maqbool","id":"189100160"},"message":"Nice detailed review.

The dishes I tried here were not my first time, I have tried them many times at various places and i know there taste quite well.\nVery disappointed and would not recommend anyone.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-22T06:51:55+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-22T08:41:00+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"549655574","name":"Nazish Huda"},{"id":"686049396","name":"Salman Ali Khan"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"100006520807699","name":"Naina Rehman"},{"id":"528876071","name":"Salman Yousuf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTI4ODc2MDcx","before":"NTQ5NjU1NTc0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"638049642912856","from":{"name":"Salman Yousuf","id":"528876071"},"message":"similar exp when I went thr a few weeks back!!:(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-22T07:50:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"638053609579126","from":{"name":"Qurat Ikram","id":"816014447"},"message":"This place I feel is over rated for what it actually offers.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-22T08:08:35+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"638054226245731","from":{"name":"Sufyan Khan","id":"1406140922"},"message":"Thai chicken with cashew nuts , erghhh","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-22T08:11:43+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"638054432912377","from":{"name":"Kamran Salahuddin","id":"1415943200"},"message":"Horrible food","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-22T08:12:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"638063402911480","from":{"name":"Munira Noorani","id":"100006080370346"},"message":"Agree with Qurat Ikramover rated","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-22T08:41:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjM4MDYzNDAyOTExNDgw","before":"NjM4MDQ5NjQyOTEyODU2"}}},"restaurantName":"Prawn"},{"id":"165861103465048_636270899757397","from":{"name":"Patio Pk","id":"100005838280535"},"message":"Fall Specials at The Patio - Prawn & Pumpkin Bisque, Surf & Turf Salad, Seared Scallops in lemon Cream sauce, Sole fish in brown butter sauce with capers & Smoked Chicken Parmigiana & Avocado ....","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-18T14:17:25+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-18T14:17:25+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"509213482","name":"Faria Sahar Syed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5MjEzNDgy","before":"NTA5MjEzNDgy"}}},"restaurantName":"Prawn"},{"id":"165861103465048_633708436680310","from":{"name":"Asim Abdul Razzaq","id":"1379490729"},"message":"Had Fish karahi at BOTS last night.

Dinner at Forty4 after a hiatus of more than a year, and failure to reserve space at Okra.  The place is meticulously done, with adequate lighting, formal (yet cozy) interior, and impeccable service.  \n\nThe menu is inventive, and is probably one of the better ones in the city.  More importantly, the place didn't have Moroccan Chicken, Tarragon Chicken, or any 'Chicken Steak' entree which shows that the management knows, and takes the food it serves seriously.  \n\nAnd yea, I was delighted to know that Forty4 has not jumped on the Wasabi Prawns bandwagon.  Was surprised to see tapas on the menu, which were pricier than Downtown Madrid, thereby defeating the whole spirit underlying tapas.\n\nThe menu is impressive, and demonstrates that the management has put in some serious effort in developing it.  All the prices on the menu ended with a '4', which makes mental calculation easier, and signifies management's attention to detail.  \n\nOrdered the Shrimp and Scallion Har Gow for starters, and the dumplings were delicious -- much better than that weird stuff that is served at Noodle House.  For the main course, the Beef Tenderloin was seasoned well, was succulent, and ensured that the 'meat' remained the star of the show.  Ordered it Medium-Rare, but was served Rare -- no complaints there, the rare it is, the better.  It was after a long time that I had some good ol' seasoned meat, with amazing sear marks.\n\nAbeer tried the Pasta44, and was delighted enough to exclaim \"If it wasn't for the power failure, I thought I was in Tuscany right now\".  The pasta was flavorful, and all the ingredients actually complemented each other.  Definitely one of the better pastas in the city.\n\nGot a 15% Discount on my RBS Credit Card, resulting in a per head cost of roughly PKR1300 -- which is fairly reasonable, given the quality of food served, and attentive service.  \n\nA flavorful experience.  Overall Rating -- 9/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-13T11:49:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-13T17:09:52+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501776623","name":"Shayan Shabbir Lakdawalla"},{"id":"505990155","name":"Sairah Hassan"},{"id":"100000749114514","name":"Hiba Arif"},{"id":"787375286","name":"Zain Rauf"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"753624574","name":"Shazmeen Raza"},{"id":"532862764","name":"Fatima Shafiq Siddiqui"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"683820727","name":"Aina Nasir"},{"id":"1423718906","name":"Saba Khan"},{"id":"677905296","name":"Shazia Carim"},{"id":"517470504","name":"Nida Ali"},{"id":"1510273456","name":"Daniyal Khalid"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"563320740","name":"Syed Tariq"},{"id":"524665437","name":"Saher Najam"},{"id":"635810442","name":"Kiran Afzal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjM1ODEwNDQy","before":"NTAxNzc2NjIz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"633325330051954","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Excellent review.

Dined in at Aylanto with a few friends after a hiatus of more than a year.  Ambiance and service were perfect, with the servers being attentive and food being served in a timely manner.  Just what one expects from a fine dining establishment.\n\nTried the Wasabi Prawns for starters, and there didn't seem to be anything Wasabi about it.  They were just prawns, with a non-existent flavor of Wasabi, hidden somewhere.  This starter is now as famous as Moroccan Chicken, and I won't be surprised if Khairabad also starts serving Wasabi Prawns.\n\nFor the main course, couldn't order the Wagyu because my shipment of white was still not delivered.  Tried Grilled Beef Fillet, which is basically sliced beef fillets with grain mustard, and parmesan butter -- with the temperature to be Medium-Rare.  The entree served had just the right temperature, even though it is difficult to get a precise Medium-Rare for fillets.  One could actually taste the distinct flavor of grain mustard, and parmesan butter -- with the sauce complementing the overall flavor of the beef.  An excellent (budget) entree for serious beef eaters at Aylanto.  And yea, soft drinks served were chilled (which matters a lot).\n\nTried the Chocolate Mousse and Chocolate Cheesecake for dessert.  Chocolate Mousse had the perfect texture, and the Chocolate Cheesecake was perhaps the best one I've had this side of the Rhine.  The texture of the base was impeccable, and the cheese really had that fresh feel.  Clearly, the best cheesecake slice in the city.\n\nA flavorful experience, albeit at a price.\n\nOverall Rating -- 8/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-26T15:03:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-27T08:10:33+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"688336352","name":"Abbas Farid"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"530060365","name":"Abdul Wajid Qureshi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTMwMDYwMzY1","before":"Njg4MzM2MzUy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"624825147568639","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Ammar Habib Khan:- A very well written and comprehensive review but what was the price tag ;)?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-26T20:53:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"625012387549915","from":{"name":"Ammar Habib Khan","id":"685505866"},"message":"A safe estimate is PKR2k per head.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-27T08:10:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI1MDEyMzg3NTQ5OTE1","before":"NjI0ODI1MTQ3NTY4NjM5"}}},"restaurantName":"Prawn"},{"id":"165861103465048_624304117620742","from":{"name":"Tabinda Baig","id":"512678715"},"message":"I am a HUGE fan of Chatterbox, the Pie in the Sky Cafe on Zamzama. It's a little bit nuts how much I like it. If you ever visit, you must try their moroccan chicken and chicken with spinach sauce - divine and great pricing too! One night I was craving something from their fabulous kitchen so I placed an order for a Prawn Fettucine Pasta and Chicken Wrap for my mother. I was utterly heartbroken to receive what I did - pasta with no white sauce, instead it was doused in oil. I would have still eaten it without the white sauce but it was impossible to consume with all that oil. My mother's wrap was ridiculously small, it was embarrassing because I'd blindly promoted everything - What could be wrong in the eyes of a fan, right? To top it off, they had put GST charges on\nthe bill. This is where my knowledge might lack a bit, but is that a common practice? Shouldn't they inform the customer when he's ordering? I complained about this to them when I received the bill and they said they would check and get back to me and I never got a call. I suppose, the lesson from all this is that some places are best for dining in only :(","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-25T18:06:36+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-26T08:08:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100006519972294","name":"Ali Raza Q"},{"id":"1013437557","name":"Farhan Hafeez"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAxMzQzNzU1Nw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTAwMDA2NTE5OTcyMjk0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"624307627620391","from":{"name":"Tasneem Rasheed","id":"744696139"},"message":"That's a lot of oil!

Repelled by the plethora of fast food joints in Dolmen Mall's food court, Noodle House seemed like a safe bet.  Liked how they take orders -- just tick items off the Order Pad, and you're done, an efficient method possibly pioneered by CHIPS in the city.\n\nThe service was quick, and smooth, with the meal being served within 15 minutes.  Placed an order for Wasabi Prawns for starters, followed by Chicken Pad Thai, Wok fried honey and sesame chicken, and Wok fried noodles as a side.\n\nWasabi Prawns had that perfect batter, with just a little bit of crunch, which was not overpowering the flavor of the prawns.  A bit of sweetness, and a bit of spice -- but couldn't really get that Wasabi kick, there was probably too much of lemon.  At PKR720 for 4 pieces, the starter was certainly pricey, and the flavor didn't really justify the premium price.\n\nChicken Pad Thai just had the right level of spice, and flavor -- and was probably the best entree of the evening.  Cooked perfectly, it had the right spiciness to it.  I couldn't really figure out what was 'Wok fried' about honey and sesame chicken -- seemed more like sesame chicken dipped in honey.  I could only taste honey, and nothing else.  And finally, the noodles weren't Wok fried as well -- they were probably just boiled.\n\nThe soft drinks were priced at PKR160 each (before tax), which is definitely excessive.  At the same price (or slightly higher) one can probably order Japanese Sake rather than a carbonated beverage, while dining East of Suez.\n\nTotal bill was PKR3800 (incl. taxes & tips) at a per head cost of PKR1268.\n\nAll items ordered had their own distinct flavor, and this is something that needs to be appreciated.   The price points are high, and in-line with European prices, particularly for casual dining.  At the end of the day, its just Pad Thai and Wok Fried Noodles! European prices in Karachi, while purchasing power is poles apart doesn't really make sense.  \n\nWith Pad Thai, Wok Fried Noodles, and other related items, gaining traction in the local market -- prices (in the market) might just will eventually converge to a more affordable range.\n\nA fairly expensive, and flavorful experience.  Recommended for the flavors.\n\nOverall Rating -- 7/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-31T23:15:18+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-31T23:15:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1652751344","name":"Rameen Alvi"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"600140056","name":"Rabbiya Abdullah"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Its just amazing how Mr Big with Egg n Cheese is perfect every time . It feels like they have time frozen the entire process for the last 20 years . Succulent , Flavoursome , Juicy Satisfaction all wrapped up in One little Piece of Heaven. I'd rate it 12/10 , 2 extra points for that smile on my face every time I take the first bite.\n\n2- Al Asif Square : Though a bit risky for some fellows but to be honest the place was packed . We had food at MADINA RESTAURANT which is located inside Al Asif Square and to some people's surprise there were few families around there as well ( well to do families at that ) enjoying food , the atmosphere was friendly we were greeted as warmly as always . We had the famous Dumba Boti , Afghani Pulao , Namkeen Gosht and Karahi.  Now i don't want to waste time in describing the brilliance of food . \nThat is the best Authentic Afghani food out there, Period , 11/10 . One extra point for the Afghan brethren for their every gracious hospitality. \n\n3- Tayyabi Restaurant : Located in Hussainabad. It one of the few unsung heroes of Karachi. We ordered Prawn Masala , KataKat , Chicken Chargha Fry, Malai Boti and Tikkas . Food was served a bit late as they prepare all the dishes fresh and from the scratch. \nPrawn Masala is one of the best in town as the prawns just melt in your mouth and mix with that zesty masala . THE DAMN ! \n\nKatakat and Chicken Chargha fry are good too . All in all yet another place you wont come out unsatisfied or cheated, EVER . 8/10 . -2 for the stolen side mirror of my friend's car from the parking :P\n\n4-  The Burger Shack: I have Shake Shack every week so it did not impressed me much. But i'd like to commend the owner for doing the best damn possible thing by cloning a famous international franchise's menu and making it possible to offer taste in it as well. I was not disappointed to say the least. 7/10\n\n5- Cafeela : Simply put , Zahoor bhai you rock . Okra Jalfarezi , Malai Boti , Nathiya Gali Qeema , Shahi Tukray , Chicken Yakhni Pulao are all yum. One of the best value for money in town. \n\nI am a safe eater and a Desi at heart as I get to eat really yummy mum cooked food and these are few of the places I go to eat or get food delivered when I want to eat out. Flying out tonight . Will Miss Karachi as I always do . Tada !","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-25T12:11:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-27T10:31:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"644528865","name":"Shirin Imani"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"647407601","name":"Syeda Rizvi"},{"id":"655910358","name":"Moiz Kazmi"},{"id":"549477264","name":"Junaid Wasti"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"1521133249","name":"Maouz Qazi"},{"id":"504239316","name":"Hala Qureshi"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"591166408","name":"Faisal M.

A place of traditional Desi  Khaba and it is quite famous that they usually eat with their full?. Love to eat ?.Specially Desi Ghee Stuff either its Karahi either its Fish or etc.\nUnfortunately the both guests by profession were Doctor?s even one of them was a highly known surgeon \n@ 9.25 I reached at kolachi before that I had ?NO? reservation I thought its Monday so at Do Darya it will No Crowded at kolachi ..When I reached it was packed jam and on call it was 56# minimum 1 hour wait?\nI know the owner?s Owais very well and even Umair but both of them were not present suddenly I asked from a attendant who else is looking after him. He took Mr.Amir Name I want to that guy directly and I just simply request him that we are four people and I have guest from Lahore and I called Awais for the reservation however I was dishonest  itna to chalta hai na yar!\nYou know what he did he moved us all the way on a prime location on top which was really WOW. It was full moon yesterday and the view was extremely awesome don?t have words to express. \nI order Fish, Grilled BBQ Prawns, Chicken Reshmi Kabab,Peshawari Karahi,?.\nThe best part was they served in once and it was well maintained in temperature, Quality & quantity \nThe Guest was impressed by the Fish Taste!  Usually they had fry fish in Lahore ,Sardar or Bashir Darulmahi wala are best in Lahore but again the difference was fresh water and a Sea Fish.\nI was stunned by the service standards the best part was after every 5-10 minute there was one new attendant coming and asking need anything else sir, you liked the food etc. \nI strongly believe one should have to profuse with his service standards in a completion war either its taste either its services should have to up come with its own standard?s and have the raise the bar which I guess kolachi did in real.\nThe best part wow to WaoOOoo factor was I asked him for the bill which was 11,000 for four people I just had a pause that I took 6000 cash which I thought will be enough I was like Wooooffffffffffff I checked the bill again and call the waiter are you sure it?s mine twice he said ?yes? Sir then I asked again politely just have another confirmation unfortunately the bill was exchanged with other table he made apology on this but I guess it was another great experience with Kolachi?.\nOvais,Umair & Amir, Great Work Guys \nKeep the Bar high and for other Restaurant?s I don?t want you to get disappoint but dear all serious time to think!\nValue against Money !","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-20T09:02:23+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-21T07:01:27+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"100000920102281","name":"Shehzad Abbasi"},{"id":"685959051","name":"Ali Hasan"},{"id":"100001252885971","name":"Marium Sultana"},{"id":"1048532624","name":"Syed Nawfil Rahim"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"789225723","name":"Lalarukh Khursheed Farooqui"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"},{"id":"698359177","name":"Mashal Iftikhar"},{"id":"752330337","name":"Faiz Kazi"},{"id":"558178102","name":"Safoora Fahad"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg1NTA1ODY2","before":"NTI0NDc2NzM1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"606461179405036","from":{"name":"Noveen Siddiqui","id":"520455792"},"message":"Lovvvv this post!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T10:26:42+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606481659402988","from":{"name":"Syed Nawfil Rahim","id":"1048532624"},"message":"Kolachi make you say WOW!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T11:42:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606561942728293","from":{"name":"Huma Zunnoon Khan","id":"100000710303249"},"message":"wondering wat if the bill was correct ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T13:26:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606562169394937","from":{"name":"Huma Zunnoon Khan","id":"100000710303249"},"message":"* wld have been","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-20T13:27:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606568629394291","from":{"name":"Noveen Siddiqui","id":"520455792"},"message":"Huma kitni buri baat hai...

So yesterday I decided to give them a visit. And with no surprises, everything I heard was true. Endless variety of food including BBQ, Chinese, Handi, Afghani, Italian,etc. ,etc., and what not. Although, the differentiating factor which separates Kolachi from all other infinite menu list buffets in town, each and every item was fresh and scrumptious and hard to resist, making it impossible to taste all of them. Specialties being Prawn tempura, Malai Boti, Paneer Reshmi, OOzi and Karhai. These are items for which you definitely need reserve some space in your appetite. And what to say about desserts, simply divine and celestial.\nA few negligible cons, long ques on high running items but visible efforts by staff to manage the crowd.  Secondly, when I called them two days back to reserve the water front table, I was told that they are not making reservations. Therefore I made sure to reach max by 6:15 pm, and was told that all water front tables are already reserved!!!!! And lastly the sitting area in the lounge was very hot and dark and to make it worse, red dim light hanging over our head. \nAll in all, I would like to thank Kolachi for treating my taste buds although there is still room to improve their aesthetics.\nScore : 8.5 /10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-02T06:15:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-02T10:27:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"716476797","name":"Rania Jawaid"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"690005614","name":"Owais Asif"},{"id":"100000108654676","name":"Samia Hyder"},{"id":"100002991745435","name":"Asmma Omer Khan"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"1200204425","name":"Sana Zaidi"},{"id":"100003829944979","name":"Saba Farooq"},{"id":"660435505","name":"Sajjad Bin Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjYwNDM1NTA1","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"596871450364009","from":{"name":"Saad Ahmed Qureshi","id":"739137597"},"message":"thnx for the detailed review, its helpfull","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-02T10:27:53+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTk2ODcxNDUwMzY0MDA5","before":"NTk2ODcxNDUwMzY0MDA5"}}},"restaurantName":"Prawn"},{"id":"165861103465048_596260220425132","from":{"name":"Shahbaz Khan","id":"616310708"},"message":"Review on \"The Lantern\" : Score 9/10!\nLocation: Peaceful and conducive to family dinner/aftari.\nFood: The pick was the Red Hot and Sour soup! fresh veggies chopped with precision.

We had no prior booking and arrived at around 6:50pm. There were just 2 of us and due to some no show(s) we got a table. It was not the best table as it was right above the kitchen and smoke from there making things a little uncomfortable but when we asked the section staff to find another table for us, they were quite keen to find us another table but it was packed to full capacity. We are off to not so good start, as ambiance which is always a crucial part of any Kolachi experience was quite ruined due to that. But hey it was not all over yet.\n\nIftar was served and there was plenty to choose from; pakoras, samosas, chana chaat, dahi phulkis, chicken wings, chicken drumsticks, lahori fish, fruit chaat.. among drinks there was roh-afza, lemonade, mango squash and lassi. I tried chana chaat, chicken wings and drumsticks and lahori fish. everything was quite good, esp chicken wings and drumsticks were both high on taste. I didn't try the rest even though it looked so tempting but I was saving space for dinner. \n\nDinner was followed by iftar and the variety just got wider. There was a salad bar. Prawn tempura, chicken Manchurian, oyster beef(frankly I don't remember the sauce), chicken chowmein, fried rice, thai curry, julienne beef, alfredo pasta, mini burgers were among non desi items. Also hot and sour and corn soup. Those dishes can be avoided in favour of what Kolachi is actually loved for. But still if too tempted go for julienne beef, it was moist and succulent. \n\nAmong desi items there was biryani, nihari, haleem, white karhai, kunna. Again I only tried haleem among it all as there is so much one can stuff oneself with. \n\nKolachi's favourties included hunzai handi, paneer reshmi, peshawari karhai, malai boti, bihari tikka, seekh kebab and 3 types of naan. That's the section one should save most space for. Everything was usual delightful and you get half your money's worth just in that section.(As if rest of the variety was any lesser).\n\nFor rest of the half your money's worth, there is a speciality called oozi. Lamb served with rice, it was love at first bite. I am sure most of you would be going back for a second serve.\n\nThere were plenty to choose from the desserts section. I am sure I have missed out on some items from that extensive menu.\n\nAs far as variety goes, it can't get any better. 10/10\n\nService was usual friendly and attentive. Esp youngsters running the show are very dedicated and you see them passionately working with their staff to make sure everything is going right. Hats off to them.\n\nOverall 8/10, since I couldn't get a better table which was in no way Kolachi's fault but it did make a slight dent in my overall experience and some non desi variety was not Kolachi good. \n\nTo those who are annoyed by the mention of Kolachi, sorry guys but we need to appreciate good things in life and Kolachi has definitely earned it. way to go !!\n\nHighly Recommended any time :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-01T09:23:14+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-02T02:36:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100003553069288","name":"Chanelle Adam Khan"},{"id":"622532960","name":"Ayesha Qureshi"},{"id":"1091359728","name":"Anila Noman"},{"id":"543131941","name":"Morag Khan"},{"id":"1257283317","name":"Aymun Zafar"},{"id":"1368416951","name":"Muhammad Jamal"},{"id":"777939362","name":"Faaiz Deda"},{"id":"1248903988","name":"Amal Faisal Ashoor"},{"id":"672220217","name":"Sukaina Ali"},{"id":"1285044693","name":"Sami Ibrahim Tamimi"},{"id":"592929129","name":"Aqsa Jaliawala"},{"id":"517470504","name":"Nida Ali"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"511130593","name":"Layla Rizvi"},{"id":"100002643873225","name":"Fatima Haider"},{"id":"586930217","name":"Maheen Ahsan"},{"id":"751819688","name":"Erum Hamza"},{"id":"1346742308","name":"Ijlal Malik"},{"id":"520115164","name":"M Usman Khaled"},{"id":"547996286","name":"Shahzaib Javaid"},{"id":"1586595597","name":"Khurram Iqbal"},{"id":"555766150","name":"Faruk Lania"},{"id":"696432032","name":"Samiullah Tariq"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk2NDMyMDMy","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_596242730426881/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjk2NDMyMDMy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"596249420426212","from":{"name":"Rizwana Shamim","id":"663526141"},"message":"happy reading :) Go kolachi Go :):)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-01T10:00:11+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"596251557092665","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"Shazeb Siddiki","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-01T10:07:47+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"745715077","name":"Shazeb Siddiki","type":"user","offset":0,"length":14}]},{"id":"596253257092495","from":{"name":"Hira Saiyed","id":"867800502"},"message":"Oh thank you.

And I don't doubt that for a bit. I have been dining in some of Do Darya's best-kept secrets for many months now, and I must say it's quite an experience. This so-called food revolution happening in the area has seen many of the country?s best new restaurants sprouting like mushrooms in this scenic area. And for those of you searching for a culinary experience like no other, look no further than Sajjad restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant is renovated recently with the special addition of huts on the sea, unlike other restaurants who have the seating arrangements / tables quite off the sea area. However, the interior will remind visitors of a minimalist. The decor allows the simplistic beauty of the food to really shine, though beauty isn't the only thing bringing folks to Sajjad. The restaurant buzzed with excited energy and was comfortably full with seemingly satisfied patrons.\n\nWhen we reached there, we witnessed an unusual rush and a lot of cars parked already including rushing media vehicles and few dozens of private security vans. When inquired, it was revealed that some ministers and a lot of media, like a bee looking for a beautiful flower, were there. The restaurant's capacity is maximum 800 people and i was Gobsmacked when the person on the welcome desk told us that there are already more than 950 people there, a lot others willing to stand and few desperate to sit on the grass and pay the full amount. Early reservations always save us from embarrassment especially when one is accompanied with friends or guests. Similarly; the timely reservations made earlier on the day, we were induced to our table with a reservation platen / tablet. The placement of  our table was actually the starting of the stupendous experience we have had later last night. It felt that we were in the middle of the sea. The best part was not only the comfortable sofa and lighting but also the privacy. When we go to the other eateries located at Do Darya, the placement of tables or seating arrangement is too congested /crowded. One can easily hear what the other person is talking on the other table. Fortunately, that was not the case there. Also the lamp which lit the table was soft and did not hurt the eyes. There was a bottle of Hand Sanitizer on all the tables.  \n(Picture is attached) \n\nFOOD\nFor Iftar, nicely packed dates in a plate were served with Roohafza Sharbat in milk/water. The Rooh afza Sharbat actually brought back a lot of child hood memories and it quenched our thirst while breaking the fast. Since there was rush; as mentioned earliar and the typical buffet mentality, to fill the plates unnecessarily and the competition, look I have the most on my plate! the items for Iftar finished quickly. Lo and behold, it appeared the staff was well trained to deal with such panic stricken crowd and situations, in few seconds, another serving was brought. Believe you me, fresh and more quantity than before. I detest to mention this here but I witnessed with my own eyes that people who were there in their Chauffeur driven cars, filled another plate and called their drivers to have it. The staff still did not say anything and it seemed their smiling faces spoke a lot. Literate, Ill-literate and A-literate :)\n\nMy friends and I went for namaz and decided to take the Iftar items, if left by the mob, after namaz. To our utter surprise, the restaurant staff kept on refilling the items, fresh and sizzling hot, after namaz too unlike other restaurants where they do not refill after namaz and focus only on dinner items once the fast is over. By the way, they had Wazu place and proper arrangements for both ladies and gents for Namaz/prayers.\n\nThere were almost nineteen (not really sure and please blame my taste buds) Pakistani dishes for dinner. Starting from Sajji to Lamb ( Kuzu Tandir Aakha dumba or Grilled meat of lamb) Prawn Tempura, Fish, Live BBQ items , Live all sort of Tandoor/Naan,  Nehari, few different types of Biryanis and a touch of continental food in form of 3 to 4 chicken and beef items, Cheese Pasta, variety of Chinese and honestly there was so much, I have forgotten the names already. The taste was divine! No exaggeration but I have never tasted such delicious food in my life ever. Not to forget, all that happening where that competition going on in the crowd, who has the most food on one?s plate! :D I would rate 10 out 10 to the food.\n\nThere were different variety of salads and all the dishes had a name tag. There were a few desserts, but they finished quickly so waiting was the only option. While we were waiting, we saw Kakark Dooh Patti Chai (tea) being cooked live. What else could caffeine lovers dream of? Not to forget, very few places where Tea is part of the Buffet. We all had our tea and mean while dessert bar was set up again. My rating for dessert is 7.5 out of 10.\nThere?s no doubt at Sajjad Restaurant will quickly become the hottest reservation in town! \n\nAlbeit there were Janitors cleaning the over all restaurant then and there, one thing Sajjad Restaurant people should work on is cleanliness in the rest room. I am just not writing this here likeother  people who have bad experiences of other places and without talking to the concerned people of the restaurant, they mention it here. Actually I spoke to the restaurant staff near the wash room area and told them about it, where they told me about the huge crowd using the loo,  and the reason was valid. It was not surprising for me when they told me that they place napkins/ tissue papers time to time but there are few customers who do not hesitate to take the tissue roll /napkins, hand sanitizers and place it in their pockets or bags! After all they pay a good amount; so, without any judgement, according to them, they are entitled for the toiletries as well! :-)","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-07-20T01:25:24+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-20T09:21:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"535211286","name":"Abdul Aziz Anis"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"611818619","name":"Humaira Shakil"},{"id":"100001715666710","name":"Razak Latif"},{"id":"1049298397","name":"Sadiya Naveed"},{"id":"547465214","name":"Rehan Latif"},{"id":"100001098310753","name":"Ashfaq Parekh"},{"id":"1170084800","name":"Ammaar Ahmed"},{"id":"761278691","name":"Abdullah Soomro"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"657151302","name":"Nishat Mustafa"},{"id":"509686069","name":"Hasaan Mubasher Sheikh"},{"id":"619270706","name":"???

Also had fresh Watermelon :) Food was very very nice and presentation was extremely good with few exceptions.....Grilled Calamari and Avacado Prawns....didn't like both. Servers were very well trained. Only other problems i noted were that since the restaurant is established in Swiss Cottages, the kitchen does not have a separate access like China Kitchen hence everything moving in/out has to pass through the service area where guests are housed and although the food quality and taste was beyond imagination...there were not many guests. I mean we were the only people there. This is probably one reason that they are closing down for lunch wef 10th June and now they will be only open for lunch on weekends. I would give food 9/10, service 8/10 and ambience 7/10. My favorites were Crab Grattin, Grilled Seabass and Grilled Red Snapper!

Firstly, a customer's opinion is their right and that must be respected. However, as I have said numerous times, there must be some detail to why the opinion exists for it to be useful in a public forum like SWOT. Simply referring to price and talking about the concept of value for money isn't enough. Nor is an unsupported remark about service in a passing comment. And as Ali Tariq said, it is absolutely true that value for money varies wildly for each individual and that is how it should be.  However, frankly at 2400 per head, I don't think you can eat extraordinarily at Pompeii or Okra etc ... starters average around 4-500+, main courses range between 700 and 2400+, desserts and drinks on top of that ... add tax and tip, you are easily around the 3000 mark or more. Again, while respecting the right of people to have their opinion, I am just making the point that we all need to be responsible, clear and informative in conveying that opinion ... be it positive or negative ... statements without details dilute the value of the opinion for those of us who actually read them with interest. Finally, and this is my own personal thing, if I am happy with my dining experience, then that is value for money received ... however, as Merchant Abid said, even the I may find the restaurant too expensive to become a frequent customer and that is also fair enough!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-03T04:55:41+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"519505693","name":"Ali Tariq","type":"user","offset":481,"length":9},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid","type":"user","offset":1349,"length":13}]},{"id":"552473951470426","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"It's a pity your experience was not worthy of the money you spent.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-03T05:04:27+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTUyNDczOTUxNDcwNDI2","before":"NTUxMzkwNjgxNTc4NzUz"}}},"restaurantName":"Prawn"},{"id":"165861103465048_551973018187186","from":{"name":"Saima Achria","id":"518308086"},"message":"Enjoy an Early Dinner for only Rs.819/+ tax with the Early Bird Special's at The Patio.

Went to Ginsoy extension last Saturday with a friend around 2:30sh. Called in to reserve but the reservation wasnt made, but since it was just two of us so luckily didnt have to wait. Placed our order right away coz both of us were extremely hungry. Ordered Prawn Balls as appetizers, Large portion of Prawn chilli dry and a medium portion of Kung Pao Chicken. \n\nFirst the good....The quality of food was excellent and by the end of it we were stuffed and could not possibly have another bite.... Thats one reason I will go back...\n\nNow the bad....We got our appetizers in 25 minutes and on inquiring why it took so long they come up with the excuse that \"sir yeh tau sab fresh banta hai\", as if other restaurants serve re-heated food maybe? Instead of the prawn chilli dry they got chicken chilli dry and tried to convince me that it was fish...As soon as we dug in our main course the waiter comes up and hands us the bill... I was like \"What..!\" So then he got all uncomfortable and went back... While we were in the middle of lunch one of the \"managers\" comes up and says \"Sir aap ko yahan say hatna PARAY GA\"... My friend was like Excuse me... and then they tell us they have a reservation of twenty people.. My friend goes like well thats not really our problem especially considering you got our order wrong and made us wait another 15- 20 minutes... \nI actually started losing it and to add fuel to the fire they sent up the reservation of 20 upstairs so that we would make a move..So my friend got up and started asking the manager about what is going on to which he had the audacity to say \"Tau kya main iss reservation ko APNAY SAR pay bithaon ga\". I swear to God it was his lucky day that my friend was fairly cool minded and the so called manager didn't say that to me otherwise consequences would have been bad... Now unfortunately it was a huge group of ladies and we didn't feel right in making them wait furthermore, to which we found out that they got their reservation wrong as well coz apparently they had booked for Saturday and they noted it down for Sunday... So we asked the waiter to pack our food, but two of the ladies were nice enough to finish our meal and then leave, but ofcourse we couldn't do that.. \nWe paid our bill downstairs and the last nail in the coffin was that they didn't get all of the things we got packed and go like \"acha aap ko sab chahiye tha\"... \n\nOn our way out one of the managers downstairs apologised profusely but once u leave a bitter taste its hard to recover..\nWhen in the service industry one can't afford such goofups no matter how much pressure there is.. The food and service needs to be equally good.. Seems like the booming success of Ginsoy has gone to their heads and they need to come down a couple of notches before it gets too late.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-18T18:23:50+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T07:50:14+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"537640231","name":"Zara Gulabo Makhdoom"},{"id":"515251346","name":"Adnan Nazim"},{"id":"633231978","name":"Iqbal G Hussain"},{"id":"1421223164","name":"Bushra Joyo"},{"id":"685505866","name":"Ammar Habib Khan"},{"id":"614385745","name":"Amber Haque"},{"id":"602590206","name":"Ariya Patel"},{"id":"219000363","name":"Deen Sheikh"},{"id":"600144971","name":"Khawaja Zee"},{"id":"649390400","name":"Amber Zulfiqar"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"286700230","name":"Umair Shafi Afzal"},{"id":"860945273","name":"Erum S Rahim"},{"id":"568861941","name":"Hassan Ahmed"},{"id":"516995421","name":"Rabiyah Tungekar"},{"id":"553586655","name":"Ambreen Intizar"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"753811545","name":"Atiya Abbas"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzUzODExNTQ1","before":"NTM3NjQwMjMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"542850962432725","from":{"name":"Atiya Abbas","id":"753811545"},"message":"seems like nothing went right for them, terrible service","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-18T18:50:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"542851452432676","from":{"name":"Sharmeen Merchant","id":"765975396"},"message":"The service is pathetic.

So when I remembered that Noodle House had opened and people had highly recommended the Wasabi Prawns, I decided it was time to try them. Just picked up a take out order and was efficiently helped by two young ladies who were stationed at the hostess station at the front of the restaurant. Was not surprised at the pricing because that was another thing that the reviews had highlighted ... Noodle House wasn't gonna come cheap! Still, I got the larger sized Wasabi Prawns that ended up close to Rs. 1200 for 8 (including tax).\n\nNow to the food. First, the size of the prawns was quite impressive with my mother-in-law exclaiming out loud when she tried one! The prawns were cooked perfectly and served on a light bed of salad with some corn. To be honest, I did enjoy them but they were not something that I would be running back to anytime soon. Maybe the problem is that the reviews that I had read led me to expect too much ... or my palate isn't as sophisticated as the rest! I wasn't blown away even though I have to give great appreciation for food quality.\n\nStill, I do want to give Noodle House food a try in the future. There are things on the menu that could be interesting and hopefully I will feel more positively about the food ... for now, it was good but not great!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-20T10:56:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-20T12:35:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"1626883423","name":"Fatema Murtaza Lacewala"},{"id":"504319826","name":"Sarah Masood"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"864470709","name":"Syed Muhammad Taha Askari"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"514492150","name":"Syed Adeel Rizvi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"MTAwMDAxNDU2MDU5MDk1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"543909692326852","from":{"name":"Salik Sajid","id":"512577683"},"message":"wasabi prawns with corns?.... those yellow pieces r bell peppers/capsicum","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-20T11:07:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543910075660147","from":{"name":"Syed Adeel Rizvi","id":"514492150"},"message":"I'm hungry now!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-20T11:09:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543930098991478","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"I could be wrong about the corn, but I didn't think it was bell pepper!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-20T12:33:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543930555658099","from":{"name":"Salik Sajid","id":"512577683"},"message":"even at first i thought those were corns coz of yellow square small pieces same as corn size","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-20T12:34:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"543931052324716","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"Fair enough!

Port Grand is such a blessing for us Karachiites! And I am so happy to see that they're maintaining the place well and the dining/ snacking options are increasing and improving. \nWe were there last Sunday to watch the match. Had a nice long stroll in the food street before settling in the match arena. Boba Tea and Twisty Crispy Fries kept the kids entertained (although I thought Twisty Crispy Fries were quite tasteless, soggy and overpriced), while Irfan Malik and I were tempted by the live cooking station of Thai Me Up. The Tom Yum Goong clear soup with prawns was amazingly pleasing to the senses of smell and taste, and the serving was whoppingly generous! Chicken in Oyster Sauce was also delicious although could've done without the overload of onions in the sauce. Prawns in Red Curry on the other hand was delightfully fragrant and was packed with zest and richness. Overall, Thai Me Up is a great find. The only hitch is that since the food is made to order live in front of you, it takes a bit long... Long enough to make you miss a spectacular Afridi knock of 88 off 48! :( And therefore stressful enough to make you forget to click pictures before devouring it! :/ Anyways.. the place is a welcome addition. Oh and by the way, watching the match there was super-exciting with a very enthusiastic crowd, a live DJ covering the commercial breaks with Jazba Junoon, Josh-e-Junoon, and the likes, and of course, the Dhol walas. It was quite festive and I'm sure tomorrow's match would be quite a treat too. :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-23T20:45:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-24T09:05:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"679913965","name":"Hina Dhanani"},{"id":"674095744","name":"Nadia Rauf"},{"id":"585612434","name":"Chaudhry Abbas"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"691451746","name":"Ayaz Sheikh"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"201004010","name":"Saiem Nasir"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"Njc5OTEzOTY1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"525928340791654","from":{"name":"Saira Malik","id":"1133719630"},"message":"Nezihe Hussain/ Snaps Har..

Special WOK Soup (white) is refreshingly different in taste from other special soups being offered by Chinese food outlets. Butterfly Prawns for starters were excellent. Prawns were of good size and just the right amount of batter. We were recommended fried fish with crumbs by the order taker (not in menu I guess) and although it's not really Chinese food but perhaps best fried fish you can have in Karachi. I requested for something in beef and was suggested Beef Bulgoki, another stellar dish which was adequately spiced, and meat was tender as compared to any normal Beef Dry Chilly. Thai Chowmein is also a great offering for people with taste for Chowmein, again a recommendation from the gentleman who took order. I found WOK great in terms of value for money as portions were generous (specially rice) and food arrived well in time (about 35 minutes, but then I live in Clifton) and in piping hot condition. Definitely a must try for Chinese food fans.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-20T07:12:40+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-20T07:12:40+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"656462656","name":"Mustafa Ahmed"},{"id":"585054134","name":"Helal Enver"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTg1MDU0MTM0","before":"NjU2NDYyNjU2"}}},"restaurantName":"Prawn"},{"id":"165861103465048_522873424430479","from":{"name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed","id":"786471893"},"message":"Where exactly is Xander's and what all should be ordered there?

The veggies though seemed to have been added in the end, something we didn't expect but didn't really mind\n\nGoan blue crab curry: Waiter recommended we have it with rice, the curry was delicious but it was really difficult and messy to eat with the crab, specially with rice. How does one eat this?? I ended up extracting the meat and then having it with Naan. Syed Ali Raza Abidi, maybe crack the prawns open for easier access before serving?? it was delicious though!\n\nPrawn makhni: deeeelicious!\n\nTsunami prawns: Poor waiter had forgotten and served it in the end. The prawns were perfectly cooked but there was just tooooo much sesame and we peeled some off. i was expected three different chutneys but got only one, so i inquired with the waiter. he said this is the only chutney but graciously brought us the imli and red chutney we get with the fish too.

As usual.\n\nA friend of mine who is a recent return from Down Under was very frustrated with the negativity he was seeing all around Karachi. So I decided to show him the finer things Karachi had to offer. With me, the finer things always begin with food. Duh! So since he and I both enjoy seafood, Hook Line and Sinker was the way to go. Having been there once before, I knew the ambiance, service and quality of the food itself would definitely be a good experience. Although we had made dinner plans, we ended up going to lunch, since there was a family dinner I couldn't manage to wiggle my way out of. I do believe that was the first day of lunch service, and what a lunch it was! \n\nUpon entering, I met the charming Haider Zaidi, and after the introductions, he took me around on a small tour of HLS. It was beautifully done, and the sofas in the cigar lounge looked exceptionally comfy. I could just imagine myself curled up in a corner with a good book and a cup of coffee. The deck seemed like such a wonderful, cheerful place, but was closed unfortunately, because there was some repair work being done in a neighboring house, which was causing a whole lot of noise. So we chose to sit inside the dining area, where we could actually see the kitchen! My friend was most impressed, as was I. Once we got settled in, we ordered the grilled calamari, seafood chowder and Prawn ala Rooni for me, and the Red Snapper with Pepper Onata for my friend. Although there was a bit ofa hiccup with the calamari, which I told Haroon about once I got home, the flavor was sharp, spicy, and tangy. Then came along the seafood chowder and our mains. I have already raved about my food in a previous post, and my friend also thoroughly enjoyed his meal. Wiped his place clean, in fact. I was also kind enough to let him taste Prawn ala Rooni the way I enjoy eating it. I skip the rice, and ask for the bread instead, dipping it in the delicious sauce and eating it along with the prawn. He actually enjoyed it more than his own meal! Anyone who orders the Prawn ala Rooni, I urge you to ask for the plain bread that's served in the bread basket, and have that instead of rice. I guarantee there will be an entirely different dimension of delicious flavors to your meal. We had wanted to round off our meal with the kiwi mousse, but unfortunately it wasn't part of the lunch menu. Which is fine, because now I have an excuse to drop in for dinner and have my dessert then :D","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-17T20:40:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-18T11:14:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"507728929","name":"Sarah Sherazee"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA3NzI4OTI5","before":"MTA3NjI4NTIxNQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"506941222690366","from":{"name":"Amna Saeed","id":"763004361"},"message":"Whats the budget per person?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-17T20:41:58+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"506941902690298","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Depends on what you order, but round about Rs. 2000 per head.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-17T20:44:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"507114012673087","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Nice one. \n\nWe sat on the deck yesterday since it was a Sunday and the construction next door had been stopped.

Agreed, the food was delivered piping hot well on time despite the rain, and is amazing value for money. But the flavor is no where near to all the SWOT-hype I've read lately. It made me sad.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-15T15:40:58+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-17T15:31:51+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100003048636530","name":"Sami Baba"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAzMDQ4NjM2NTMw","before":"MTAwMDAzMDQ4NjM2NTMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"505954149455740","from":{"name":"Kanwal Anes Ahmed","id":"504592087"},"message":"Anum - I ordered Golden Dragon too today.

Instead, tried the grouper fillet on waiter's (Shabbir) recommendation, and it turned out to be pretty ordinary to say the least.\nAll in all, I'll give the food an 8/10.

Hook Line and Sinker couldn't have been a better getaway choice. Since the menu was preset, I chose the seafood chowder, hoping that it would actually taste like clam chowder and not potato soup with a meager handful of seafood thrown in. To my delight, it was a joy to eat, and definitely filling. There was plenty of shrimp, fish, squid and NO POTATOES! Joy of joys. Since i usually wait for my soup to cool off and then have it, the temperature it was served at was perfect for me. I can however, see how it would have been a tad bit too cold for those who like their soups uber hot. I also believe a bit of sweet paprika and freshly milled black pepper would have enhanced the flavor of the soup, but that's a personal preference. \nOnto the entree, I chose the Prawn ala Rooni, which is named after the ever-charming Haroon sb, and which I hoped would live up to its name. With the promise that it would be, I dived right in with relish. Although I did  improvise and used the crusty olive bread which was served in the bread basket as a sauce mopper upper instead of the served rice, simply because I felt the rice would dilute the garlicky, gingery, peppery, spicy prawn broth I simply didn't want to miss out on. While I suppose it did seem odd to be at a fine dining establishment and using one's fingers to eat, I can't say I regret it, because my food was oh-so-mmmmm! There was a burst of flavors, the spicy, sour notes of the broth, with the tender, succulent prawns. \nFor dessert, there was a chocolate cake, which was the perfect end to a perfect evening, meeting new friends, and seeing familiar faces who I have interacted with on this very forum. I digress for a moment to say it was a delight meeting all of you. The cake was rich, dense, as Mahvish put it, chocolatey, and just how a cake should be. The frosting was smooth, velvety and gorgeous. A must-have for chocolate lovers! I couldn't finish the entire slice, even though it was so delicious, simply because I was so full. I wish I could have stayed a bit longer, but my curfew is unfortunately shorter than Cinderella's but I was so glad I didn't miss out on this dinner. It would have been my loss, for sure. In my humble opinion, everyone who loves seafood needs to go there at least once. It's an experience you won't regret. If I may though, can I ppppplllleeeeaaassseeee have a whack at the menu? Please, please, pretty please! I would, of course, have to taste ALL the items listed on it to describe them properly :D","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-25T19:20:38+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-26T13:02:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000059823691","name":"Haroon Leghari"},{"id":"718233292","name":"Naheed Ghulamhussain"},{"id":"589565258","name":"Sabrina Shahid"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"687255482","name":"Haider Zaidi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"MTAwMDAwMDU5ODIzNjkx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"492898934094595","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"nice review :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-25T19:59:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"492901167427705","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Thank you :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-25T20:06:39+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"492941204090368","from":{"name":"Haider Zaidi","id":"687255482"},"message":"Wow ! :D","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-25T22:30:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"493055447412277","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Thanks very much :D Now, let me fix your menu.

Everyone loved the ambiance and the place is beautifully decorated and exceedingly welcome. The head honchos Haroon Leghari and Haider Zaidi have worked very hard and are seen interacting with their customers not once but several times. Their charming CSO Zara Tareen adds the right woman's touch.\n\nComing to the food - the team HLS had made us a fixed menu at my request. \n\nThe food:- \n1) SEA FOOD CHOWDER - thu some of the bowls were a tad warm when they came (but were warmed up immediately when pointed out) weas creamy, chunky and flavourful, needed a tad bit of salt but that's a personal taste and was added as per required, \n2) the tomato basil soup - was rich in colour and flavour, I had one spoonful to taste and liked the clear clean flavours.\n3) Caesar's salad - didn't try that so will ask the one person who did to please comment on it. \n4) zesty red snapper - one of my fav dishes was a medley of colours and flavours \n5) prawns ala Rooney - Haroon Leghari's personal recipe should be HLS signature dish. One point that was made and very valid - all the prawns in this dish have to be of the same size and weight, since its quickly cooked at high temps, the smaller ones got a little over done.\n6) seafood katakut made in pure butter is heaven on a plate.\n7) the dark chocolate gateau was divine..... Aamina Jahangir it's a pleasure to see your product maturing so well. It was a great cake.\n8) the mint lemonade at HLS knocks the rest out by a mile. It's refreshing even in this weather.\n\nFinal verdict.....HUGE GENEROUS HELPINGS, GREAT ATTENTIVE SMART SERVICE, BEAUTIFUL AMBIANCE. \n\nWE WILL BE BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN.......\n\nTHANK YOU FOR HAVING US.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-01-24T20:22:52+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-25T12:27:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"100003672338905","name":"Umbreen Mahmood"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"899930573","name":"Kiran Ali"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

The \"Gosht Nu Dhansak\" (Mutton Daal with Brown Rice) with the kachumar and two types of achaars stole the show, specially the limun aur mirch ka achaar which is made with lemon, ginger and green chillies soaked in lemon juice made me go back over 25 years when this used to be made in our house. Not a big fan of eggs but I must say both the Akoori (scrambled eggs) and Scotch Eggs, both were pretty decent. My earliest memories of Akoori dates back to over 30 years when it was served as a snack in the evenings in the lawns and tennis courts of Karachi Club. The Kolmi Na Kevab (Prawn Kebabs) was very interesting. Was so satisfied with the Dhansak that I didn't try the \"Patra Ni Machi\" (Fish in Green Chutney rolled in Banana Leaves). The \"Lagan Nu Custard\", \"Malpuras\" and \"Savaiyyan\" for dessert were so different and delicious - could not stop my hand at \"Savaiyyan\" and ended up having two large helpings of it.

My 2 other (older) kids also love sea food so BOTS was an obvious choice for us. We reached there at 9m, ordered Red Fish Finger and Dhaka Fish Finger, Fried Prawns and Prawns Karhai.  The service was prompt and the food as good as always. While we were enjoying our meal, our newest addition to the family felt left out and insisted on tying the Dhaka Fish Finger so wifey gave her a small piece and...whoa...it was like love at first bite for her (although technically she cant bite right now) . To our surprise, she had quite a few pieces after that and thoroughly enjoyed the meal.  Guess some of us have only acquired the BOTS taste, this generation is born with it. \n\nMy kids went to Ali Raza to thank him for a lovely meal and he reciprocated and came to meet us as well.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-03T13:16:13+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-05T08:44:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1551738621","name":"Syed Yousuf A?idi"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"741385426","name":"Riaz Salim"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"751819688","name":"Erum Hamza"},{"id":"512589628","name":"Jawwad Raza"},{"id":"100000860154915","name":"Aman Jaffery"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"617680709","name":"Fatima Ali Rizvi"},{"id":"751030900","name":"Zoha Manzar"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"631611761","name":"Adnan Zafar"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"528525436","name":"Umtus Sanna Hussain-Mirza"},{"id":"591211818","name":"Hafsa Zulfiqar"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3Mjg3Mzkz","before":"MTU1MTczODYyMQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"467861749931647","from":{"name":"Sharmeen Sharif","id":"702746868"},"message":"Well Aneek I have ordered BOTS twice but both times I was really disappointed with their service :( ....the first time I ordered they sent me something different from what I actually ordered ...

Chicken, lettuce and the sauce, all three were served separately so you have to make your own wrap. It stays crunchier this way. Tastes great.\n\nHoney Glazed Beef Ribs-This was a hit. Everyone liked it. Beef was cooked to perfection and it tasted divine.\n\nWasabi Prawns-Loved the texture, the taste.

Had a long chat with the manager to whom we showed the dishes and asked him to taste as well as we hardly touched our food after first couple of bites. He informed us that the management was perhaps undergoing changes etc and change of chef he himself was new that month.

My husband had made the reservation well in advance and thus we were promptly taken care of as soon as we entered the restaurant. The staff was pleasant and courteous without appearing to be excessively concerned or fake. While we scanned the menu and discussed the various options we were served the complimentary bread basket along with seasoned olive oil and the herbed butter. Between the two of us we decided to order 2 appetizers and of course one main course each. So these are the things that we ordered: Mezze Platter, Grilled Tiger Paprika Prawns, Beef Medallion (for me) and Stuff Baked Chicken (for my husband).\n\nOn the whole we found the food to be excellent and the portions to be appropriate. All the dishes including the bread basket were of high standards with the exception of Mezze Platter which was average by the standard of everything else that was served. The Tabouleh was served without any bulgur wheat while both the Hummus and the Mutabel lacked a certain kick. Having said this, in line with the bread basket served to us earlier, the pita breads that came in the platter were perhaps the best that I have had in Karachi. Soft to the extent that they melted in the mouth while soaking in the flavors of the dips that the accompanied. The Paprika Prawns were juicy and succulent and were spiced to perfection. My husband truly enjoyed his chicken and particularly the creamy sauce. For me the star of the evening was the Beef Medallion which I had requested to be medium well and indeed it was medium well. I had also asked our waiter Amjad to replace the mash with steamed and saut?ed vegetables but he was kind enough bring both and I am glad that he did because even though I normally do not each mash potatoes because I find them to be exceedingly heavy, I enjoyed this one as it was light and airy.\n\nAfter we got done with our main courses, we asked for the desert menu and just as we started scanning the menu Mr. Sam GM from Olivetto?s team stepped in and told us that he had already taken care of it and had arranged for a Chocolate Molten Lava on the house in honor of our anniversary. While we waited for it we got a chance to chat with the gentleman himself and enjoyed our brief conversation with him as we touched upon the different ingredients used and the special techniques deployed by the chefs there. The cake was definitely worth the wait as with the first plunge of the spoon the velvety and glossy lava oozed out from the centre of the cake. What I personally also enjoyed was that instead of the usual vanilla ice cream, they served the cake with a toffee/caramel ice cream which was great complement to the chocolate cake.\nAll in all it was a great culinary experience and everything from the food to the service was of high standards. Olivetto is definitely a place that I would like to visit and explore further. Thank you Sam GM for taking great care of us :)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-11-14T16:20:36+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-15T07:27:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002605916001","name":"Sadaf Munir"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"},{"id":"512864890","name":"Scidra Usman"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"690005614","name":"Owais Asif"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"640287493","name":"Mariam Ahmed"},{"id":"1213637082","name":"Sundus Qasim"},{"id":"500616229","name":"Sama Aman"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"1542669392","name":"Mohammed Rizwan"},{"id":"1269558660","name":"Hussain Tariq"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"676040882","name":"Saniya Shadab"},{"id":"631611761","name":"Adnan Zafar"},{"id":"504592087","name":"Kanwal Anes Ahmed"},{"id":"538934895","name":"Amad Ul Hasan Siddiqui"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTM4OTM0ODk1","before":"MTAwMDAyNjA1OTE2MDAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"460422507342238","from":{"name":"Afroza Bhamani","id":"846664538"},"message":"What a lovely write up!!!

I hardly get the opportunity to complain about the food.  Maybe once or twice but that was a long time ago.  Today however was another matter.  We were the only one's when we arrived so looked forward to total attention.  We visited for lunch at 1 p.m. and though the service was as excellent apart from the waiter not showing us the Special's board and expected us to walk around the corner to check it out.  We insisted he take the board off the hooks and bring it around to show it to us.  Not good!.  The food today left a lot to be desired. The bread basket had one type of bread a bit too dry and the other a bit too oily for my pallate.  The Herb butter was too soft and not being given a butter knife was I thought not really up to the mark.  The small vegi tit bits that are rolled out prior to the meal were just that much dryer then they should have been.   My host and myself were not very interested in a starter but decided to share the Scallops with Truffle Oil.  When it arrived it looked awful lying in the plate with such thin slices which probably amounted to one large scallop full stop.  They had a light drizzle of black pepper and did not look very appettizing!.  Then came the belch from me followed by one from my host.  It tasted vile!...we called the manager on duty and asked him to try one too..he took away the plate tried it and then returned initially to say that it tasted fine to him.  When I insisted he rethink his response as it tasted very bad he said it was probably the Truffle Oil being of very strong and pungent texture.  He brought the bottle over and let us smell it.  Yes, it was the Truffle Oil!...it was so strong it blew my nose away and my host's.  We all decided that the only way to add Truffle Oil to the Scallops would be to use just a drop rather then baste it with it.  The two don't work together for me as it stands!.  I had ordered the Red Crab with Garlic and Virgin Olive Oil.  A great dish and looked amazing!...the Red crab just looks so delicious even before you tuck in to it.  The taste was as expected wonderful but ever so slightly over cooked and wee bit dry in some parts.  The garnish was on the stingy side but was adequate because the Crab took center stage.  I noticed as the bread basket neared its end and only the dry bread was left there was no attempt to replenish it or even an offer to the effect.  The waiters were attentive and kept removing the left over crab shells and my host's prawn shells.  By the way my friend had the Spaghetti with Seafood.  He thought the spaghetti seemed a bit more soggy then normal having tried the same dish at one or two earlier occasions!.  The Prawns he said were extremely good.  Some background in the Restaurant might have also helped in the overall ambience!.  The shell crusher didn't get much of a chance to do much but the Crab drawer was a good touch and it helped a great deal in getting in to the nook and crany's of the crab shells.   Then came the dessert.  I ordered the Rasberry and my host the Lemon Sorbet.. both were excellent but little in quantity I thought....on hind sight it was good that it was not too much as it was lunch and ended a mixed bag of experiences at OKRA this lunch time.  I was looking out for Ayaz who I was sure was there when we arrived...I saw his Green BMW outside but when I asked later he had left.  So I did not get a chance to point out the issues...I am sure though the issues would prob not have occured to that degree if he were there!...so with all said and done...I think OKRA has to be the natural choice for the Foodie in Karachi if one is looking for excellent food!..and service!","type":"status","created_time":"2011-06-09T11:30:44+0000","updated_time":"2012-11-14T21:17:47+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"189732934411198","from":{"name":"Ali Sultan","id":"625641714"},"message":"i totally agree,but a aways think crabs should be eaten on a boat yaa phir with ur friends in a house where u really dont worry abt the table manners,and that rooni soon on me,as far as our good ole OKRA is concerned,am happy 9.99 out of 10","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-06-09T11:43:31+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"189736071077551","from":{"name":"Haroon Leghari","id":"100000059823691"},"message":"Ali...like I said in my piece...OKRS rarely disappoints!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-06-09T12:04:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"189736231077535","from":{"name":"Ali Sultan","id":"625641714"},"message":"am not promising as u guys are no ordinary foodies,but soon will have a crab party at my place","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-06-09T12:05:28+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"189736314410860","from":{"name":"Ali Sultan","id":"625641714"},"message":"and as far as okra is concern,i just seconding u:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-06-09T12:06:07+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"189736764410815","from":{"name":"Haroon Leghari","id":"100000059823691"},"message":"a small correction...the word ' music ' is missing in the background comments above!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-06-09T12:08:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"189736821077476","from":{"name":"Haroon Leghari","id":"100000059823691"},"message":"OKRA not OKRS","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-06-09T12:09:10+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"189737001077458","from":{"name":"Ali Sultan","id":"625641714"},"message":"unplugged buddy unplugged","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-06-09T12:10:03+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"189940631057095","from":{"name":"Rehan Babar","id":"558349064"},"message":"Good work Haroon - I completely agree food at OKRA is never disappointing - perhaps the reason I found the Spaghetti with Seafood a tad bit dry was because previously I had it with cherry tomatoes as opposed to only olive oil and this time while ordering I forgot to mention that.

Really tough to decide which was better than the other as all the items ordered were made to perfection, so I will rate in my order of preference.  Black Pepper Beef (though not allowed to eat beef, but still couldn't resist the crispy fried beef that was absolutely irresistible), Prawn Chilli Dry (not a fan of prawns but this was out of this world), Chicken Bulgoki (far superior that the Bukgokis I've had at other Chinese eateries apart from the Korean Restaurant) and Sweet and Sour Chicken (the best I've had in town - very authentic).  All the above perfectly went with the Fried Rice, Chowmein and Mao's Chilli Sauce).

Im assuming given the fortnight of shutdown everyone did want to try it out, plus a Saturday night and lets admit it, it is a place more often than not we all do enjoy a lot. \n\nTranslation: a 20 minute wait told upfront. It was made comfortable thanks to the lovely cane sofas outside Ensemble which was well complemented by pleasant breezy weather. Courteous and apologetic at the same time for the wait, really made the difference.\n\nWaiters attended well to orders and there was no wait. The entrepreneur was actually watching everything when not going to and fro checking on all tables. We didnt realise our food was taking time. We were reminded by his presence. Honestly i guess the world must be complaining so much because every table and every waiting guest was being checked on. \n\n Food: burgers am told were lovely. I tried them once before: they were good so am sure these were great as well. to quote one of our: \"best burger!\" . I gladly savoured the fries and iceberg+arugula they opted to ditch. \nPrawn on toast: among the place' star items on the menu and surely didnt fail to deliver again. \n\nChicken satay: i love their satay usually. i may have loved it today but erm the peanut butter was not offfset but sufficient fish sauce/ salt. though have to appreciate how very creamy it was and how succulent the chicken pieces were. plus the garlic rice: lovely. not overpowering at all. ample chilli flakes but not at all spicy. \nI did send the satay back for redoing with fish sauce cuz it was too sweet but it didnt come back to my liking. honestly: i cannot complain. The place has always served good food so once, with all the rush outside, it was alright. It also is a possibility they changed the recipe to make it a bit sweet and creamier and not salty. I cannot complain. but i honestly couldnt eat it. so brought it back home to be fixed at home. \n\nCaramel frappe was a delight as always. mildly sweet with the flavour of caramel and so creamy. followed by red velvet cupcakes: mmmmmmm.\n\nthe place is always such a pleasant experience. have always loved their food and decor but the attention today and the efficiency by the staff despite all the rush added to yet another good evening.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-11T20:42:32+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-12T10:36:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"423319967719159","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"forgot to mention the other aspect of Xander's which also left a mark: beef patties and prawns on the bread were all well covering the bread, instead of the gaps. you get a good whole fill of what your ordered. so much attention to detail.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T05:37:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423376751046814","from":{"name":"Fahad Humayun","id":"756755028"},"message":"I had an awful first experience there and I had decided not to go there again...but now maybe I will :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T10:32:56+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"423377937713362","from":{"name":"Ambreen Haider","id":"686115120"},"message":"have read of a lot of bad experiences at Xander's  on SWOT and honestly AlHamdOLillah we've never had one. \n\nmore importantly each time having observed Alexander stand and monitor everything and keep checks on everything, it got a bit difficult for me, personally, to believe things could have been so bad for people without having a solution to a problem. \n\ni do suggest you go. hopefully you wont have a bad experience but in case you do, do tell them team or Alexander himself if he's there. things are attended to: again: from observation of each visit we've made there","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-12T10:36:32+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDIzMzc3OTM3NzEzMzYy","before":"NDIzMzE5OTY3NzE5MTU5"}}},"restaurantName":"Prawn"},{"id":"165861103465048_423032367747919","from":{"name":"Maryam Merchant Bilwani","id":"670330647"},"message":"Which out of the two is a better option to take a group of 15 for iftar...bbq tonight or kolachi?

Both were really good, I like the Chilli Prawns better. For the Main Course I ordered Chicken & Jalapeno pasta which I loved. For dessert we ordered Creme Brulee which was really odd. It looked really different from any Creme Brulee ive had and the Caramelized layer was way toooooo thick...like fat sheets of hard candy and a little burnt...sticky situation for the teeth, not attractive plus I forgot my hammer at home, usually I keep it in my purse...my luck!\n\nThe service was good and the waitstaff very courteous. But one thing they must change is the music...what is up with a place done up the way Saffron is but playing Lady Gaga & Beyonce's Telephone, Shakira's Waka Waka, Justin Bieber's whatever it is that he sings and 1 more that I cant remember and all ON REPEAT!?! I mean some nice chill beats with maybe a little Talvin Singh type stuff thrown in would've completed the audio visual...it really threw me off, the audio & the visual going together is so important for a restaurant's ambiance I believe but then again I also believed that miniature unicorns existed when I was a kid, I knew the normal size ones were obviously a myth...so anyway, what do I know.\n\nAnyhow, moving on along a decent experience, would go back to try other stuff on the menu. I did notice that all their ingredients were pretty fresh...Ive learned that to judge a restaurant's food quality here in Karachi or maybe in all of Pakistan..one of the things you can look for is how fresh the iceberg lettuce is, and it was pretty darn fresh for that late in the day so that was a definite PLUS! They were right on with the fresh ingredients.\n\nOH YEH! Almost forgot....one last thing if you own this place, you might want to tell your waitstaff that when they bring out the pepper mill for your pasta or anything of that sort, they might want to hold it closer to the plate and not a couple of feet off the plate in the air, the fans and ACs were on pretty high and pepper loves getting in your nose. Something about pepper and noses, they never could get along...eyes are also with the noses on this one.\n\nAnyway, the place is nice and I can see a lot of effort has been put into designing it so that's it, im gonna go finish my pasta that I got parceled...yummmmmm  :D","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-25T22:28:38+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-27T15:15:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"714115614","name":"Nefer Sehgal"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"643423090","name":"Junaid Zuberi"},{"id":"511487130","name":"Beenish Barlas"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"521702664","name":"Saira Faruqi"},{"id":"752330337","name":"Faiz Kazi"},{"id":"515674780","name":"Ali Raza Pir"},{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi"},{"id":"502637248","name":"Ather Ul Islam"},{"id":"527710365","name":"Hira Tareen"},{"id":"788400499","name":"Rehman Aziz"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz","before":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"416929561691533","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Waiasay ajj kal Qawaali laggi honi chaiyay herr jagah :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-25T22:32:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417043231680166","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Zara....welcome and am loving the review. \n\nYou went to Dinner WITHOUT ME!!!!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-26T05:33:36+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417059078345248","from":{"name":"Bilal Alvi","id":"641495625"},"message":"ahahahahahahaha! i loved the review! made me laugh out loud \u003dD","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-26T06:51:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417164155001407","from":{"name":"Saira Faruqi","id":"521702664"},"message":"That was fun reading :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-07-26T14:54:04+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"417429431641546","from":{"name":"Aves Cochinwala","id":"100000661921576"},"message":"Tsk, tsk Lady , u got it  all wrong .

I was overjoyed with forty4, cafe subhani and china kitchen, which was expected from the reviews. But extremely disappointed by BOTS and TUC. The fried prawns felt like I was chewing the rubber that comes out of a glue gun. I couldn't even taste the actual fish covered by the thick carpet of bitter coating. The biryanee was so over spiced, it literally burnt my taste buds. And the food wasn't cheap for a roadside dhaabaa. Infact it was an insult to our cuisine. I like to support small restaurants too. But only the passionate ones that care about food. Not ones that literally kill the taste of seafood with their overzealous cooking using overused oil. I know it feels good knowing the owner and having him reply here and all. But gimme a break.

WOW what a beautiful place - i am already a fan of your work and was once again loved the way you have created the lovely cozy yet spacious ambiance with 44.\n\nthe staff is courteous and helpful, polite and cheerful - always a good sign.\n\nthe food itself ranged from excellent to alright. first the excellent dishes\n\n1) the chicken mousse and rice cake starter - tiny bite-sized portions - lovely to start off a meal\n2) the bread basket - with a variety of breads - each fresh and very good - i didnt need the garlic butter - it was lovely to nibble of the buttery salty breadstix on their own and the toasted flat bread with flax seeds nice touch.\nall except 1 starter we ordered were on Aman's recommendation and i have decided to let him order for me in future \n3) the sea food trio - with smoked salmon stack, prawn cocktail with a spicy tomato based dip and grilled fish with a avocado salsa - very good - and beautifully presented\n4) The Prawn Gambas - out standing - have already gone into the buttery details of this on the pic - a MUST try for all prawn lovers\n5) THE WOK FRIED CRABS - OMG serious love happening - already apologized to Syed Ali Raza Abidi for this but i think the affair with the Goan Crabs is over for a while.\n6) the Cajun chicken Cesar salad - this is NOT my fav salad to begin with - am not a mayo fan - but from what i sampled - it was fresh and very vibrant in colors and textures - taste was pretty good - but i would never order this anywhere in the world\n\nthen came the entrees - (yes we eat a lot)\n7) Angle Hair pasta with scallops, mussels calamari prawns and fish - garnished with sun dried tomatoes and fresh parsley - the sea food was totally fresh and perfectly cooked, the dish seasoned well - the pasta was a bit over done for my palate but then i know many here who dont like el dente - so it can be quite bothersome for a chef.\n8) the beef tenderloin with tarragon - and chocolate balsamic reduction - was the biggest steak (we estimated it to be about 300 gms - but Aman said it was between 250-275gms) cooked to medium rare (thu unfortunately this was ordered Medium) - the reduction was amazing - smooth and silky, sweet and tangy and perfectly balanced with the char grilled beef and the herbs. if i am not stuffed with the Gambas and the crabs on my next visit - i am ordering this - and i like mt steaks medium rare.\n9) the Chicken and Beef Burgers - both were ok and presented well, one with home fries and one with the most amazing gratin - when there is so much other stuff to try i wont be ordering burgers at a place like 44\n10) the red thai curry with chicken and steamed rice - actually better than Fuchsias\n11) chicken roulade in pesto sauce - the presentation, the sauce and the sides were great - the chicken itself a little dry but definitely something that can be looked into and i would recommend that for all kukur lovers (which thankfully i am NOT)\n\nafter all this food - we had no space for dessert and were going to skip off for some healthy apple tea that Abid Aziz Merchant has brought back from Turkey but Aman wont hear of that and sent us the three desserts on the house. \n\n1) Creme Brulee - hands down the best in town - smooth, silky, velvety and the perfect crust on top. this is one the simplest desserts to make but it defeats many a chef.\n2) Chocolate Fondant  cake - perfectly made - rich and decadent\n3) Bread and Butter pudding - like Cesar salad and chicken another dish i rarely order anywhere - was different from ALL its cousins in town and was actually very nice - served with a yummy homemade banana ice-cream - this i loved and will have with a little chocolate sauce. and maybe fresh bananas and caramelized walnuts (see Aman here is a new dessert - simple and easy)\n\nover all experience - was FABULOUS - and i am going to re-inforce my statement about AMAN VIRJI becoming a culinary force to be reckoned with in the near future  \n\nThank you 44 team you have just become one of my top 10","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-23T14:43:05+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-25T14:25:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"100001692464184","name":"Amna Jatoi"},{"id":"697092175","name":"Mohammadi Kakal"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"2720923","name":"Fahad Ahmad"},{"id":"1108385601","name":"Marvi Jatoi"},{"id":"509507958","name":"Omair Ahmed"},{"id":"777621756","name":"Masooma Dharamsey"},{"id":"504093997","name":"Raza M"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1288336373","name":"Muffi Halai"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"1759997925","name":"Tabish R.

Perfect place to sit outside and have dinner. First rcvd the bread basked, the bread was okay but the chilli flvrd butter(or so i think it was, pretty good). Next came the mains for grilled jumbo prawns with risotto and pesto and shrimp pizza. Grilled prawns were great, pizza was good too(although i thought it would be some thing else), it was pesto instead of marinara sauce and shrimp, 2 kind of cheese with sun dried tomatoes and onion. I guess the experience was okay, not that good to get me through again.\nAfter that went to Berrylicious, had coconut and passion fruit with strawberry. Both were really great almost reminded me of Pinkberry in dxb. Both flavors were similiar to Pinkberry which made me think that is this the franchise of Pinkberry or did they make a really good copy of it?\n\nAlso went to friday to port grand and settled for charman mao, which was strictly average. Ordered bbq wings, manchurian chicken, dry beef with chilli and vegi rice. Everything was decent except beef, i couldnt taste the beef at all. Also went to dolmen city tariq road, went to chairman mao again with a friend as we had to go for dinner somewhere else, ordered crispy beef and prawn on toast.

The crispy beef and chicken Manchurian were not bad, not great or out of this world or anything but decent enough to order again when you have a craving for Chinese.

(prawn balls were a seperate charge) and as usual their helping was so much that we actually had leftovers!!! We hogged the food literally. \nSpecial meesage for GD as they insisted I write this: \"My team thinks Golden Dragon is the best Chinese they have eaten in a long time and also said Thank you for being punctual and delivering hot food\" Seriosuly guys when you work with a team  they are like family and when they were beaming after lunch it felt good:)  Even the rice which I normally find bit undercooked was perfect. 11/10 because it was my treat and made me feel super;-)","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-18T19:47:55+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-19T07:49:31+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"529040368","name":"Syed Mudassir Hussain"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzkyNDcwMTcw","before":"MTA3NjI4NTIxNQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"400086203375869","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"that review is icing on the cake","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-18T19:51:06+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400087536709069","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Too many typos..must be the suroor from the losing the cricket match! lol!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-18T19:53:34+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400118713372618","from":{"name":"Qamarunnisa Asim","id":"1076285215"},"message":"Farhat Rabia:Your reviews are always a treat to read and this one is like as najmi sahab said ' icing on the cake'...Thank You!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-18T20:58:46+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia","type":"user","offset":0,"length":12}]},{"id":"400357003348789","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"QA...anytime as long as food is good im a happy camper:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-19T07:33:48+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400357496682073","from":{"name":"De Joe","id":"597535350"},"message":"u should try the crispy beef....... its sinfully good.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-19T07:36:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"400361970014959","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"oh yeah..next time for sure!thanks for the sugegstion!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-19T07:49:31+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDAwMzYxOTcwMDE0OTU5","before":"NDAwMDg2MjAzMzc1ODY5"}}},"restaurantName":"Prawn"},{"id":"165861103465048_399292463455243","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Went to bots late last night with some friends, place was crowded and the staff was working at their best to keep up, but unfortunately demand had over taken supply, with the peak summer season, this new and emerging food street was really alive and kicking, with great difficultly we managed to catch hold of our designated server, he was flying like a kite caught in a storm. Finally ordered and food arrived in an hour after we reached, but once it was served all the pains were forgotten and we virtually drowned in the taste and flavor of the fish karahi, grilled and fried fish and the Chicken Malai boti and Behari Kabab, garlic nans and vegetable rice. Following that was sara's surprise desert neatly packed and presented with finesse, Shahi Tukra's, Caramel Egg pudding and Lab-i-Shireen, Shahi Tukra's were really sweet and well made with Zafraan, illachi and all the works, the caramel pudding was equally good. Lab-i-Shireen needs to be thicker and have some more ingredients in it to make it more original, another good option could be a mango based desert for the summers, even home made mango ice cream is a great option. The addition of desert is great as now one doesn't need rush elsewhere for desert after having Tsunami Prawns and can simply douse their taste buds with Shahi-i-Tukra's.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-17T10:10:37+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-18T19:02:09+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"667871448","name":"Sheikh Mohammad Faisal"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1473681227","name":"Shabnam Jabbar"},{"id":"543405800","name":"Tahir Wahid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNDA1ODAw","before":"MTE5ODgzMTM3Ng\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"399296960121460","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"Comprehensive review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-17T10:25:33+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399299070121249","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"I need dictionary's support to understand few words.

I went out to Biryani of the Seas (BOTS) last Sunday and it actually turned to be a gastronomical disaster. I was extremely disappointed because while the food wasn't horrible, this place came highly recommended by family and friends, however the food they served was nothing to write home about. Here are the highlights :\n\n1)Prawn Biryani :- We started off with a prawn biryani which we assumed to be a house speciality. They biryani that was served was unusually cold, had a very subtle hint of masala and had all of 7-8 tiny prawns (yes, I counted). I completely understand if the lack of prawn was due to the breeding season but our server said nothing of this sort to us when we ordered.\n\n2) Tawa Chicken : Things simply went downhill after the biryani. The Tawa chicken incorporated two pieces of burnt chicken and the chicken was also overcooked on the inside. I was a little confused by this dish because having had tawa chicken in other places, I assumed that they would use boneless chicken instead of a breast and a leg piece. Additionally, While I appreciated the nice kick that the dish had, the rest of the table thought that the extra spice was simply trying to overcompensate for what the dish lacked.\n\n3) Leather jacket fillet : While the fish was perfectly cooked, I couldn't even detect a hint of flavour in it, not sure if the Tawa chicken had sabotaged my taste buds by this time but this dish felt oddly plain.\n\nOn a more positive note, the honey chilli prawns were satisfactory and the assorted chicken bbq made it worth our while to dine here but on the whole BOTS turned out to be a disappointing experience. I am not sure if I caught them during an off-night or if my expectations were too highly but BOTS failed to live up to hype for me.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-16T21:42:50+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-18T15:53:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"100002402711136","name":"Tazeen Hasan"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2","before":"MTAwMDAxODU4NDUwMDEz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"399064373478052","from":{"name":"Khalid Ishaq","id":"680185313"},"message":"Quite a\nSimilar experience\nHad food poisoning after my first visit to BOTS n on d second trip ordered tawa chicken which was almost burnt","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T21:53:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399066506811172","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"To each his own....I eat BOTS 3 times a week...no problem so far","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-16T21:59:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"399094416808381","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Looks like i spoke to soon about not getting complaints for a while on SWOTS :) - But Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

Our reservation was for 2:15pm. 5 of us reached on time and ordered the starters and soups. 4 of us were so called detained (by their kids) and reached around 2:50pm. The manager made such a big hue and cry in an elevated voice that why people at our table had not turned up? I was so offended and wanted to leave that instant but my friends calmed me down and found it too inconvenient to change locations as the rest of my friends were on the way. I admit we were partially at fault but this kind of treatment for higher turnovers is unacceptable. People sit and smoke at tables, chat etc when they finish their meals. The whole idea is to enjoy the day/night out and NOT stuff our mouths and leave so the next lot can do the same. Oh and the food was nothing to write home about. The atmosphere was poor; it was too loud, waiters bumped into our chairs and the rude manager gave us the eyeball.\n\nSecond experience\nLiving in Khi we dont give up easy. So I was craving chinese and my hubby wanted to try out somewhere new than our usual. So I said ok lets give Ginsoy another chance; but lets order in this time. Luck has it, they messed up my order I paid for Crispy(rubber textured) Prawns and they crispy (rubber) delivered Fish. When I called them up to complain they dint make it easy for me. When I asked them to deliver my prawns they mentioned it atleast 5 times not to touch the fish and return it as if we couldnt be trusted!! The delivery guy asked us to show us both so he was sure that we were not wrong! And when he saw no tails on the fish he left. I wish I had just handed him both and told him to getlost. \n It was so humilliating and I am so pissed! And boy was I dissapointed with the doughy rubbery prawns they delivered. \nThis restaurant really needs to get their act together.\n\nNEVER AGAIN","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-13T17:49:10+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-15T17:45:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"611720320","name":"Quratulaien Tanveer"},{"id":"809891464","name":"Julie Haris"},{"id":"681575742","name":"Samreen Sistanwala"},{"id":"1066176510","name":"Owais Iqbal"},{"id":"515193342","name":"Mesam Akhter"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"501356389","name":"Ammara Haque"},{"id":"507428445","name":"Yasir Khan"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"877870480","name":"Bisma Patel"},{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA5ODQwOTE3MQ\u003d\u003d","before":"NjExNzIwMzIw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"397403113644178","from":{"name":"Bisma Patel","id":"877870480"},"message":"My first and last experience at Ginsoy was not good, either.

Regarding the prawns, the dish is called \"Crispy Prawns in sticky red sauce\" its heavly coated with flour which wasnt cooked thoroughly and it dint have a hint of crisp, it was soggy deep fried finger fish. \nWe had ordered American ChopSuey(red sauce) and it was so ketchupy and very 3rd grade. The Kindo was the same and cudnt figure out what is so special about the cherry chicken. Just really average food. \nI agree with all the above comments, they are pretty accurate especially Muneeb Hamdanis remark.

We were served the refreshing Log Inn special drink in miniatures glasses which was very refreshing. For starters we had Chicken strips which were delicious and crispy accompanied with dip, these were served complimentary as Najmul Quddusi was kind enough to extend the urbanite complimentary starters offer for four of us, in dine also.  As discussed with him, urbanite is a fine addition for restaurants who did not have a delivery system of their own, earlier and whose customers would like to order in deliveries. For the main course I had fried Fish as recommended, was apprehensive initially, when the dish was placed before me and I had my first morsel all the fears vanished, it was perfectly fresh, tender, juicy and great taste served with tarter sauce and lemon. Had the Log Inn Beef Cheese Burger, Crispy Chicken Burger, Penne Pasta and Fettuccine paste for the kids. Everything was fresh and served hot, burgers tasted great and fries were crisp.\nThank you Najam sahib was the warm hospitality extended me and my family.       Your keen interest and personal effort to maintain the quality and flavor at Log Inn is indeed a value addition and the secret of success for your restaurant.

As u might have read and observed, a few individuals r quite upset about their dining experience since feb/march. What our patrons actually experienced at that time was a 8 course meal when we first opened at rs1800 per head with 5 entrees at least. That on its own is great value. They were  never forced, alternate and cheaper set menus were always available. Subsequently, when the ala carte came through, we made sure to check our prices again due to customer complaints - but none of the dishes prices  were changed on an individual basis and we have manage to get an avg per head at rs1200. Duck is extra - its a premium imported meat in karachi. I acknowledge there was a one off bad experience when China kitchen was surprise swotted but that should not have individuals poking at the restaurant and it's potential customers on every positive post that comes through. Thats just sad and its like a kick in the stomach every time. I am glad that you have enjoyed your meal again and I hope that China Kitchen will continue to keep it's standards up to your mark.

I was a part of that group but I never wrote anything about my experience. Yet, I have been following most posts on it and I have seen a clear perception change. Most people are having great experiences there now and happily reporting about it. I still haven't given CK another shot, perhaps because I sensed a lack of interest on the part of owners/ management in acknowledging that they goofed up that day and couldn't care less.. and this wasn't just through notes on SWOT.. This was a first-hand experience. Anyways, the point of this post is that you just need a few words and goodwill gestures to nullify a customer's bad experience.

We had three servers managing our table and i should add the food was delicious however the service was dismal. \nThe servers had to be called multiple times to pick up the dirty dishes, requests for clean cutlery was ignored and there was a lot of confusion with the orders! It seemed that despite 3 people managing the table they could not somehow organize themselves. However the worst bit came in the end. A group of recent college graduates we were chirpy group but that does not mean we get accused for paying less! When we paid our bill the server who miscalculated the cash in his hand came to our table accusing us for paying less! One of my friends Hassaan AY politely asked him to recount the cash and it was discovered that he missed a 500rs note 400rs from which was his tip! It was weird being accused without reason!

However, the waiter there was courteous enough to request recounting in my presence as he felt the cash was less than the billed amount. Dealt in a courteous way, both parties realized that it was just a human error on his part. I believe such restaurants can safely assume that their customers will be respectable enough to not do such lowly stuff as paying less cash. Having said that, the fact that management says they will look into the matter speaks volumes of the importance they give to the customers.

Was advised on the phone to make it 8:30 to which I showed my inability so they very kindly acceded to my request to accommodate us at 9:00 for which I am extremely grateful to the management of CK.  reached at 8:50 pm to find the restaurant empty but soon other customers started to arrive and by the time we left at around 10:00 the place was still half empty (CK management, why was I asked to make my reservation 8:30 instead of 9:00 when the restaurant was not booked to full capacity?) the servers were very courteous and the food didn't take much time to arrive at the table - 10/10 for service. Starters - Hot & Sour Soup - was liked by all 4 of us but it was a bit too sour, would taste even better if the vinegar is put on hold, Wasabi Prawns - 4 decent sized prawns fried and coated in wasabi/creamy white sauce served luke warm and Crab Rangoon - creamy crab meat wontons served cold - 6/10 for starters.  Main courses, Mu Shu Chicken - DIY paper thin pancakes served separately with chicken qeema and a black sauce - very desi stuff, Kung Pao Chicken - chunks of boneless chicken in red sauce with veggies and cashew nuts which were liked by all, Beef Steak - chunks of beef with veggies in black sauce, again liked by all, egg fried rice and chicken chowmein (very salty with excessive use of soy sauce with hardly any chicken meat in it) - 7/10 for main courses.  Prices reduced since my earlier visit and quantities much improved, the above order would suffice 5 persons easily. Total damage approx 5K inclusive of soft drinks and 16% GST.

Goes well with the Jasmine Rice. \n\nThai Khao Suey: a great spicy twist blending Khao suey with Paad-Thai. \nSteamed Jasmine Rice: No complaints. \n\nPrawn in Tamarind Sauce: Haven't quite tried anything like it before but an excellent complement to your meal. It was spicy though.  \n\nAssorted Sushi and Maki:\n\nThis included Tuna, Pink Salmon, Crab Sticks and Prawn. The Maki included California Maki, Spicy Tuna and some Deep Fried Maki. \n\nI have never had deep-fried Maki before but it is excellent and a must-have. Another must-have is the Bulgogi.\n\nThe food was sent fresh to my home in KDA-1 and travelled well and the packaging and aesthetics left no room for complaints. General portions of wasabi, pickled ginger and soy sauce complemented the meal well. \n\nTHE UPPER-CRUST:\n\nPhilly Steak Sandwich : The beef was tender and I loved the panini and the cheese. The caramelised onions are always welcome in liberal portions and there are no complaints there. The beef did, however, require a little more seasoning in terms of salt and pepper.  \n\nSpaghetti Bolognese: Tasted perfect but the spaghetti seemed to be a little broken and I had to season it with parmigiano and salt n pepper. Overall the basic flavour was reminiscent of any Italian household / home-made bolognese. So no complaints.  \n\nCroissants: That's for breakfast tomorrow morning.

Taking into account the sort of reviews this place is getting, you either love the place or hate it. I for one loved it. I have come back to Patio  after a good 2/3 years and this place has certainly transformed. I was quite unimpressed with my last and only visit it and rated the place as quite mediocre. It is very very different now. \n\nThe decor has certainly improved, making the place look much more alive, modern and cozy. The service was prompt and friendly with the waiters seeming quite informed. I tried the Tapas Platter and Cheese Fondue for starters. I did not like the Cheese Fondue but loved the (baked?) mushrooms and Wasabi Pineapple Prawns. The prawns had a very interesting flavoring, the mixture of wasabi and pineapple did wonders to it. Highly recommended to be ordered on their own. \n\nFor the main course I ended up ordering the Tokyo Fish, apparently it is one of their signature dishes. It is Penguasis fish, batter fried. Crispy from the outside and very delicate from the inside. It is accompanied by garlic fried rice and spinach. Simply superb.\n\nFor the dessert I had Choco-bans which were just brilliant. Spring roll like concoction which are stuffed with bananas. They too were really really good. \n\nThough there is certainly room for improvement as my friends who ordered Mutton Maas were not really impressed with it. One even remarked that the portions were small. These are the areas that ought to be looked at. But overall a great experience. I personally see a good future for this place if they fine tune it a little more.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T20:06:38+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372078126176677","from":{"name":"Shaikh Fawad","id":"694238742"},"message":"started it all w/ the Cheese Fondue which was a very gud start, rich, but not too heavy, & not at all processed:))) the array of Tapas\u003cmentioned above\u003e were really gr8too\u003clight, tasty, wonderfully flavorful, in other words subtle, but sexy:\u003e....steak au gratin (medium) was the best dish on the table\u003cstaff was attentive, i improvised my steak w/ finely chopped ginger, really enhances the flavors:\u003e, done to perfection, and generous enough to feed the whole table:D, and the Peanut butter mousse\u003cin a deliciously edible chocolate cup:\u003e &Naughty Toffee were the perfect end to an already gr8 evening.....gud work PATIO!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T20:51:43+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372093282841828","from":{"name":"Asghar Khan","id":"100001971572016"},"message":"1250 per head with drinks and water + tips +tax can you break dawn just for information...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T21:20:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372107876173702","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"the total bill was 9005 - we rounded it to a even 1250 per person. just easy math.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-03T21:48:31+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"372219232829233","from":{"name":"Danyal Achria","id":"582960575"},"message":"Faisal Naseer & Shaikh Fawad Thanks a lot for the review.

Having said the cheese fondue I felt was extremely good and not at all too cheesy :P. The Tapas platters like everyone else mentioned were brilliant. The desserts were out of this world, even though the raving reviews for the naughty toffee, i felt the peanut butter oreo mousse was even better. It was to my liking sweeeeeeetness galore, the naughty toffee wasn't as sweet as this. So I guess for people who don't have too much of a sweet tooth the toffee will do. Service was one of if not the best at any restaurant. If ever one needed anything, you'd look up and the server would be right there, Top notch stuff.

I wish the weather were slightly better so we could sit outdoors, because the kind of racket these two separate huge groups of people were making, simply ruined our experience of such a serene setting. \n\nComing to the food, since I just wanted a light snack, I ordered Wasabi Prawns, to be followed by Tiramisu, and my husband ordered a regular cappuccino and Chocolate Fudge Cake with Vanilla Ice cream. It was rather disappointing to see just four medium sized batter-fried prawns placed on each corner of a rectangular platter with romaine and iceberg lettuce in the middle. Not just that, there was barely a hint of wasabi sauce brushed on top of the prawns. Rs 595 + tax for such a dish is a bit too steep by all standards! All I could think of at that time was Xander's OVERLOADED prawn sandwich! (which by the way, was what we had set out to eat initially, but the place was jam-packed and so I had the brilliant (?) idea of checking out Aylanto.) \n\nThe desserts fortunately were a saving grace and a half. The fudge cake was moist and dense, however, the ice cream was crystallized and even though we sent it back, the replacement was no better. My tiramisu was divine.. subtle balance of flavours, light and creamy . The coffee flavour was not overpowering but still made its presence felt. That is something I could go back to Aylanto for.. But I'll give it some time first to learn from and act upon the customers' feedback. \n\nThe service was fine, the manager was apologetic about the noise and commotion. Outdoors would be lovely once the weather improves.

Blue Ginger- not merely a name ?.a name that brings to mind intimate decor, with eclectic pieces knick/knacks, beautiful looking dishes served with aplomb and that taste as beautiful too! Last but not the least the host Hussain Tariq who I believe is the reason why I return to CBG. No matter how good a place is, how amazing the food is if you don?t manage the relationship with your patrons you will never earn their loyalty. I had taken my mother and daughter for dinner last Friday. And had a marvelous time. And a huge reason as how much we enjoyed the company of our host Hussain Tariq. My mom was so pleased I had taken her there and felt very comfortable and like tthe total ambiance,food and service. \nAnd now the food:  We devoured the bread tray and the dips!  We started with my fav CBG creamy garlic mushrooms- oh my?the garlic bits and the perfect smooth sauce made me literally lick the plate with the fresh garlic bread. The Tangy Prawn Skewers were perfectly bar b qued and so glad to have ordered the bigger helping of the dish! For main we took Grilled Chicken in Mushroom Sauce, Fettuccine Alfredo & a Blue Ginger Steak. Mom and daughter loved their food but I was little antsy  since if the steak is not as you like it then eating is no fun.  The steak was medium ?well done perfectly as most places I end up eating well-done!!! We finished off our meal with a chilled and delicious Valentino ( combination of pineapple & strawberry)\nSo Hussain thanks once again for a beautiful culinary experience.

Tempura is a  different batter.\n\nthe Koel Burger - not a huge monster that has competitions named after them - but like the place - elegant almost a small sized - but that was just the appearance - coz the beef pattie between the deceptive bun - was huge thick, juicy not overly seasoned - so the taste of great quality meat was apparent. i had forgotten to tell the waiter i don't like vegetables in my burger - but am so glad that i had - coz the lettuce was crisp and fresh, the tomatoes just enough and the surprise was the grilled aubergine under the cheese - AMAZING. a MUST try for all the burger lovers in town ( Bilal Alvi when you go please warn them - so they can have a few ready - mashallah at the speed you consume them - the chef will have trouble grilling them)\n\nby the time i got around to eat the fries they had become cold (remember i was sitting outside) small suggestion - please english mustard. but i didn't need ANY sauces - not even ketchup.\n\ni didn't sample the chicken but was told it was succulent and grilled to perfection - the garlic rice and the teriyaki sauce i did sample - the rice were yum, soft but not squidgy bursting with flavors and aromas - the teriyaki sauce was a little sweet for me and a little pale.\n\nover all a very pleasant evening - cant wait to arrange the ladies brunch there - when there will be lovely sunlight to make the experience even more amazing.\n\ncoffee and dessert were somewhere else - so thats another story!!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-06T20:39:56+0000","like_count":11,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi","type":"user","offset":1698,"length":10}]},{"id":"312209862163504","from":{"name":"Rasikh Ismail","id":"721051281"},"message":"Thank you every one for your suggestions and compliments.

We had ordered the Iftar deal from them in the past and were not impressed; however after reading such raving reviews, we thought it was only fair to give the place another chance. The first thing we noticed was how the waiters cleaned the table next to ours and threw all the empty plastic disposable bottles on the street - where does that happen?? He then brought out a bucket of dirty water and drained that too while we just sat there witnessing this. We usually love street food and do understand that sometime hygiene is compromised on, but then to witness this was a bit much! SARA wasn?t there, as his daughter is unwell, so ordered from a few suggestions that I had read about on previous posts.  At 10.15 pm the prawn biryani had finished. We ordered calamari, both in farangi masala and the desi masala, leather jacket fish, again both in farangi masala and desi, prawn karai, prawn chili dry, and the chicken biryani. Farangi calamari was very good, however the desi masala was too much, very salty and very spicy. Leather jacket fish was almost rubbery, did not taste like fresh fish, and so did not like both farangi/desi. Prawn Karai was good. Prawn chili dry was also good, however would have been better, if the spice was a tad low and the dish served hot, instead of the luke warm that it was. Finally the chicken biryani, rice was of a low quality, almost like the ?uncle ben? variety we get abroad, commonly called the ?sela? variety here, and very average, not comparable to any other biryani places around. To say the very least we were extremely disappointed, and couldn?t quite understand the hype.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-23T07:08:06+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-25T19:05:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"708085760","name":"Cynara Siddiqui"},{"id":"850419690","name":"Nida Huq"},{"id":"577571775","name":"Nazia Hasan"},{"id":"100000578236531","name":"Naheed Asim"},{"id":"1665732464","name":"Sajid Dadabhoy"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"515102478","name":"Afreen Shiraz"},{"id":"687442041","name":"Nazish Faisal"},{"id":"100000759794024","name":"Ahmed Shahnawaz"},{"id":"509422944","name":"Sahar Iqbal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA5NDIyOTQ0","before":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"301808203203670","from":{"name":"Mona Mahmood","id":"582426926"},"message":"I have to 2nd that.... all hype and hoopla n not too much taste or quality to back it up :-p the squid (plain) was the only redeeming dish while the prawn dry can be salvaged on a better day but there is better seafood out there... if u want street food then the fish/ prawn guy on Jamshed Road (been around for eons) is superb - n if u wanna slightly upmarket - Casbah at Beach Luxury makes the meanest Prawn Karahi (not on menu n apart from all the other yummy BarB seafood)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-23T07:22:49+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"301810359870121","from":{"name":"Yousuf Ali Sayeed","id":"672460650"},"message":"I agree with your assessment.

There was cheer among the people as there were many, which normally on a weekday the area is somewhat deserted.\n\nWas surprised at the interior of the restaurant, very well done as each and every inch was well utilised. Typical japanese interior, medium sized tables, upright chairs. Dim lighting but bright enough to see the plates and the dark colored chopsticks. \n\nOutside, there were tables carved out of pure seesham and soft chairs, ideal for 3 on each side.\n\nFor starters, there was all kinds of sushi... The aroma was very much inviting but since am allergic to raw fish, had a hard time to control myself. Helped myself to pickled Ginger and Raddish. Both were simply awesome as I have never had them before in any Japanese restaurants before. Raddish was sweet in taste, with a hint of orange and lime. Loved it so much that I asked for a second serving which was promptly brought to the table.\n\nThen came huge jumbo prawns, thick juicy and covered in that special crispy batter. Couldn't resist them so had a couple. Prawns were followed by California Maki, Spicy Tekka Maki, Tori Teriyaki, Ebi Tempura, Tori Teriyaki, Oishi Gyununiku Steak, Ebi Tepenyaki. \n\nEach and every serving was prepared to perfection with exceptional taste and served by well behaved and experienced waiters who also could speak couple of Japanese greetings. It was good to hear and see that the management has gone out of their way to train their staff.\n\nOne thing was annoying though.. as a policy of Oishi Sushi, there are no plastic bottles or alluminium cans allowed to be served on the tables, hence the only water they had was Evian water in a well shaped glass bottle.\n\nA real treat of a fine dinner.. Highly recommended..","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-28T13:24:35+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-29T06:18:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"1025016220","name":"Nabila Khawaja"},{"id":"626746793","name":"Hamida Najeeb Haroon"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"850419690","name":"Nida Huq"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODQ1NjIwMTMz","before":"NzQ5NzAzNDU2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"285715041479653","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"I am being jealous as how many ppl invite u ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T13:39:17+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285716544812836","from":{"name":"Khalid Lakhani","id":"711077848"},"message":"You can invite me too...but it will have to be after coming Tuesday, till then quite busy....","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T13:43:21+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285735018144322","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"What did you have Khalid bhai :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T14:28:04+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285736224810868","from":{"name":"Farhan Faruqi","id":"777647802"},"message":"SARA please dont ask for anything as for any answer, he may ask for invite ;)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-28T14:30:49+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"285738491477308","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Naaa he won't..

The sleepy little nook of a restaurant in Zamzama (are there truly any other types) is still a quiet eatery and almost seems forgotten. Thyme has probably managed on its loyal clientele. \nI revisited the restaurant on a whim and found that it was still a delightful little place that has managed to serve good, though not exceptional, food. We started the meal with Couscous Salad with fried eggplant chips and Clear Chicken Soup with vegetables. The salad was a little bland and could have done with a drizzle of olive oil but it was a good start to the meal though the eggplant chips were a great touch. The Chicken Soup was also good but lacked the umami body usually associated with chicken soup in general as a comfort food; the chicken and vegetables were nice. For the main course we had the Tuscany Beef Fillet and Citrus Prawns which were as good as they sound and thankfully cooked well and not tough in texture. Surprisingly the roasted balsamic garlic served with the bread basket was what we enjoyed the most! Sweet, juicy garlic on not so fresh bread but we didn't mind eating it raw. \nIf Thyme concentrated on the little flourishes and added them to the menu as a whole I think the restaurant would be packed.\nRating: 3 out of 5\nHave you been to Thyme and what were your thoughts? Will you be giving it a go?","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-20T09:09:56+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-20T14:41:19+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"281021845282306","from":{"name":"Ahmed Shahnawaz","id":"100000759794024"},"message":"i am quite a thyme customer,have visited it often,i do like the food very much but i always find it empty,don't know why i know the owner as well,and i often ask him why is it empty,and says it happens,but it is a nice cosy place to eat","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T09:18:35+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281022635282227","from":{"name":"Omer Sattar","id":"100001643122805"},"message":"i go there often..  i really like the food","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-20T09:22:18+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"281022945282196","from":{"name":"Sana Adnan","id":"891395441"},"message":"I love it too.

Decided on ordering the food from Arab Connection. Placed the order for Belly Dancer and Beefita / Chickita. On a brighter the service was excellent and the food arrived on the time they had committed. Another plus point would that the food is very very reasonably priced. \n\nThe Belly Dancer which is a replacement of sort of shawarmas was a disappointment. I thought it would have the authentic taste of Middle East as claimed on their facebook page, it was nowhere to be found. It was nothing like the shawarmas that are served in Saudi Arabia. SWOTTIES who have been for Umrah / Hajj would probably know what I am talking about as it has a very specific taste which I have yet to sample in Pakistan. \n\nThe Beefita / Chickita was at best, average. The taste was bland though it did have a decent serving. The only good thing about the meal was their dipping sauces aka the three wishes. The fries that came along were sort of a replica of the fries found at the likes of Kaybees or Red Apple. Basically they change colours in a few hours if you do not consume them. \n\nThough the place has been getting good reviews my experience was a little disappointing.

Decided on ordering the food from Arab Connection. Placed the order for Belly Dancer and Beefita / Chickita. On a brighter the service was excellent and the food arrived on the time they had committed. Another plus point would that the food is very very reasonably priced. \n\nThe Belly Dancer which is a replacement of sort of shawarmas was a disappointment. I thought it would have the authentic taste of Middle East as claimed on their facebook page, it was nowhere to be found. It was nothing like the shawarmas that are served in Saudi Arabia. SWOTTIES who have been for Umrah / Hajj would probably know what I am talking about as it has a very specific taste which I have yet to sample in Pakistan. \n\nThe Beefita / Chickita was at best, average. The taste was bland though it did have a decent serving. The only good thing about the meal was their dipping sauces aka the three wishes. The fries that came along were sort of a replica of the fries found at the likes of Kaybees or Red Apple. Basically they change colours in a few hours if you do not consume them. \n\nThough the place has been getting good reviews my experience was a little disappointing. I do not think I'd be ordering from them any time soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-16T15:44:32+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-17T07:05:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100000578236531","name":"Naheed Asim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNTc4MjM2NTMx","before":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"278913335493157","from":{"name":"Irfan Ismail","id":"717760658"},"message":"I ordered from there last week.

Ordered from BOT last night and was very dissapointed with the experience. I was told delivery would take an hour which was late by any standards, but at least you can say one was informed. However despite five follw up calls the foood did not arrive till an hour and a half later, which is way too long to wait for dinner espacilaly with a diabetic person waiting.  when he came the rider informed us that he was the only rider and hence the dealy. if we advertsie to such extents i think ncessary resources should be deployed. Due to the delay, the food was cold and unimpressive. Was particularly disspaointed with the fish biryani, which was fish on top of regular birnai as opposed to a proper fish layered biryani. the lady answering the phone seeemd to have no clue as to the whereabouts of the rider and despite promising to locate him and call me back (the fourth time i called) i never recived a call back. I had already fried omeltte and defrosted frozed food by the time the food came, which also resulted in wastage. if we are delaing with the cosumner market we need to be mindful of these consequences that cosumers have to face due to bad service.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-12T07:34:16+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-12T18:10:08+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000578236531","name":"Naheed Asim"},{"id":"10403487","name":"Mehreen Obaid"},{"id":"666695402","name":"Marium Ejaz Karimi"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"688336352","name":"Abbas Farid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg4MzM2MzUy","before":"MTAwMDAwNTc4MjM2NTMx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"276316139086210","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi, an unsatisfied customer.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T07:54:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","type":"user","offset":0,"length":19}]},{"id":"276320659085758","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"one of the rare unsatisfied customers of BOTS","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T08:07:27+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276321659085658","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"their delivery problems is one of their only ones. first of all grilled sea food can not travel - even the 20mins it takes to anyone's house. lets be fair. the fact it takes a long time to serve is also faced by people sitting there to order - coz certain items have to be de-frosted and that takes time.\n\nas far as biryani goes - i have not had the fish one so cant comment but LOVE the prawn one.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T08:12:42+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276322189085605","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"Prawn Biryani is the trademark of BOTS.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T08:15:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276322875752203","from":{"name":"Najam Malik","id":"610590030"},"message":"its best if eaten then and there. takeaway not recommended!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-12T08:18:57+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"276323925752098","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Nadiya...thanks for sharing.

THE GOOD! - Lovely ambiance and meal. Didn't find the portions small at all! Ordered the Ceaser Salad and Prawn open-face sandwich. Ceaser salad was so light and fresh. Sandwich was DELICIOUS and had good-sized, succulent and MANY prawns (anywhere between 15-20). I'm emphasizing on the quantities because i'd been hearing complaints about their small quantities, so was pleasantly surprised to see that was not the case. Maybe Alexandre Rizvi has taken everyones suggestions into consideration. The Prawn sandwich was flawless! Absolutely juicy and FRESH!      Now THE BAD - pls add a few more croutons in the ceaser salad (mine had a total of 3). My friend ordered the pumpkin waffle..... which only had a teaspoon of pumkin mash on it. Should be atleast 3-4 tbsp to qualify as a pumpkin waffle otherwise it's just a regular waffle.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-02T21:22:50+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-03T10:16:25+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTEzMzcxOTYzMA\u003d\u003d","before":"MTEzMzcxOTYzMA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"270393253011832","from":{"name":"Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi","id":"684515056"},"message":"service was excellent and staff was really gracious.

Once again a fab experience worth writing home about :) Gave the Roast beef sandwich with wasabi mayo and Prawn burger a go last night.... couldn't decide which one was better! The Roast Beef was cooked to perfection, neither under nor over-cooked. The wasabi hit on the palate was euphoric, and the wasabi mayo salad accompanying the sanwich was a wow-factor. The Prawn Burger was tender n juicy, smelt and tasted terrific and came with a generous amount of fries! The best part about TUC is you leave feeling blissfully full but not sinfully heavy, perhaps because everything is portioned sensibly and mostly made in-house with the freshest and highest quality ingredients. Rounded off the evening with two scoops of Coffee & Hazlenut Gelato (the hot-selling Sicilian Pistachio had run-out). The Gelato's with their silky sheen were super-smooth and delicate. Wanted to try the cheesecakes, but were too full. Plan to pick one up on saturday for a dinner..... would be great if Hav Joe recommends his personal favorite! Another great feature of TUC is that even though the place is brimming with customers, it's not noisy. On the contrary, it has a great cozy feel, which should be attributed to Hamid's warm and welcoming persona. Thanks for a great dining experience. We eagerly await the launch of the Chelo's :)","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-01T11:25:26+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-01T11:25:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"1249052648","name":"Shirin Ali Khan"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE1MDQ1MzM4","before":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz"}}},"restaurantName":"Prawn"},{"id":"165861103465048_267604463290711","from":{"name":"Abid Nisar","id":"586005404"},"message":"Forty Four : YUCK !!","type":"status","created_time":"2011-11-27T17:46:50+0000","updated_time":"2011-11-30T22:26:58+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"820702279","name":"Farhan Siddiqui"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"636734568","name":"Aly Abbas"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjM2NzM0NTY4","before":"ODIwNzAyMjc5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"267611666623324","from":{"name":"Binte Rizvi Firouzabadi","id":"684515056"},"message":"really? what did u not like?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-11-27T17:54:45+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"267615569956267","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100001014475620"},"message":"Lol...where is it btw","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-11-27T18:03:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"267639266620564","from":{"name":"Aly Abbas","id":"636734568"},"message":"That was very detailed abid !!
