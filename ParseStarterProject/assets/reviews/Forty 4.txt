Forty 4 with the wife Amrah Jung Tajik. Where do I begin? The experience was out of this world. We started off with the steamed Chicken Har Kow Dumplings. They were soft, succulent and full of zing and flavor. The sauces just put it over the top. All 6 disappeared in about 2 minutes, making me wish there were more. For the main course, we both had the Prime Tenderloin Beef Steak (medium well) and replaced the Chardonnay with a special low fat sauce (specially prepared for us upon order). From the first bite it was juicy, tender and full of flavor. Reminded me a lot of the types of steaks you find abroad. Really beyond expectation. On top of that, the entire experience was complimented with quick, polite and attentive service that really made us feel special (Safdar). Thanks for a wonderful night Caf? Forty 4.

If our set menu was mostly comprised of items with teriyaki sauce we would not survive more then a month in this cut throat business. Therefore when you make statements like 90% of our set menu has teriyaki your exaggerating and misleading other potential customers. I understand you did not like certain things you ordered which again I apologise for and hope you come back and try something different from our a la carte menu and specials menu. Thus when you post a comment atleast keep it factual instead of embellishing it like your writing a story. Our lotus and chicken glazed doesn't even have teriyaki sauce in it, so not sure why you have said that. Regarding the starter smelling raw, i will look into that once im back, as im not in karachi at the moment. Anyways we hope you try the patio in the future and have a better experience. Also judging a restaurant solely on their lunch deals is definitely not prudent.

When we informed the waiter that it was cold - he offered to take it away only to zap it in the microwave which completely dried out the chicken breasts. Service was terrible that night - we were not given cutlery with our main course and waited yet again for it.  On the whole it ruined my first Valentines dinner with my husband!

However, I have been to Forty4 several times in small and large groups and at various times of the week / lunch / dinner. One of the most consistently noticeable comments from my friends has been to acknowledge the service in addition to the food quality, selection and value. That said, I am sure that there have been issues as Aman Virji has acknowledged. For the record, I would not hesitate to take groups of friends or professional colleagues to Forty4! One restaurant that remains unmentioned is Pompeii which should be in the running as they do meet all the same standards that Forty4 has for our dining experiences. Have not been to Thyme or The Patio so I cannot comment, although others have said good things about both places ... especially The Patio. Aylanto has disappointed us multiple times with respect to food and at our last visit, we actually left without eating due to issues with the attitude of the staff. For that reason, we have not been to Aylanto for many months now and therefore things could be very different by now so it is hard for me to offer anything more than our prior experiences while acknowledging the passage of time. Okra is not a place we have visited very often but many of our friends go there and I have never heard anything but glowing reports about the food with the only cautionary factors being the small size of the restaurant and sometimes the availability of reservations. Cafe Flo has its diehard fans or people like me who feel that it is nice enough but not among our first choices.

Our premise was to find a relaxing quiet place where we could catch up on our conversation. So we sat in the lounge which was empty when we arrived. We selected from the lounge deal as we wanted something quick and simple. I took the Beef Burger & Bread Pudding deal while she selected the Grill chicken and Caramel pudding. I was happy with my plate and loved the Bread pudding but just found the helping tad too small esp. after having eaten huge portions at Forty 4 and CBG. Then again it could be because it was part of a deal hence size has been reduced (my own presumption). My friend found the Grill Chicken dry and without seasoning and she requested for some sauce. The server brought her some tarragon sauce and then she said it was much better. Service was good, very effusive and alert. We froze as the guests on our opposite table wanted the AC on full blast and the vent which could not be diverted was directed towards us?eventually we inched away to the right side of the table so we could avoid the blast. (We did mentioned this to the server who apologized and informed us about the vent)  On the whole a relaxing dinner and gupshup.","type":"photo","created_time":"2012-07-19T06:58:09+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-19T11:19:30+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"414488591935630","from":{"name":"Amjad Anwar","id":"100003647628785"},"message":"Thank You mam; Yes this our lounge deal for 539/+, It has a soft drink plus the snack and a dessert.

Im sure there are dishes on the menu which were not great tasting but we left the restaurant satisfied with our meal and will definately go again !","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-26T08:05:11+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-27T01:55:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1683849703","name":"Uzma Saeed"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"100001014475620","name":"Reshma Rajpar"},{"id":"593182802","name":"Sana Fatima"},{"id":"557321236","name":"Cyra Anklesaria"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTU3MzIxMjM2","before":"MTY4Mzg0OTcwMw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"284426898275134","from":{"name":"Cynara Siddiqui","id":"708085760"},"message":"am so glad have been wanting to go but was put off with all the bad reviews, will now go .
