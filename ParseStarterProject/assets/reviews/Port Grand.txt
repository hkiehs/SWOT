This has got to be the first time that I actually enjoyed Chelo Kebabs thoroughly, served with Lurpak butter to enhance the flavors of the perfectly seasoned rice. The chelo kebab was not hard at all, and even though not spicy, seasoned perfectly. \nThe mutton karahi was absolutely, amazingly brilliant, melt-in-the-mouth mutton with the spicy gravy. The soft chapati stayed soft even after it cooled down. The chicken karahi was pleasant as well, I just didn't find it as flavorful as the mutton karahi. The garlic raita, thick and creamy was a treat with the assorted fresh vegetables. Even the sheesha was well done, not too strong, and flavored nicely. \nFor dessert we went to the chocolate fountain and the little stall under the stairs near the Walls shop. The Khanji staff was nice enough to let us bring our desserts there to enjoy, and I had the misfortune of leaving my phone at the little stall under the stairs. \nAs I sat down at Khanji, I couldn't find my phone. My friend and I returned running back to check at both the dessert places. However, halfway there, the little dessert shop under the stairs server came upon us, saying that one of us had forgotten our phone there. I tried to give money to him and the gentleman behind the counter, but they refused. As cliched as it is, this gesture and honesty really did reaffirm my faith in humanity, and was definitely the highlight of my week.

I'd like to make some points here too.\n\n1) My father is handicapped and honestly, NOTHING is wheelchair friendly here- so BBQ Tonite deserves a special mention because it is the closest to being handicapped friendly.\n\n2) Being disabled/handicapped generally means that the person should be independent too. My dad is on a wheelchair but hates being wheeled or helped up stairs or whatever. He cannot stand or move from chair to chair and HATES it when people have to help him around/pick up his chair etc.\nWheelchair friendly doesn't mean having an elevator, or providing a wheelchair (we carry one in the car), wheelchair friendly means the person should go around freely, independently, like we do, Alhumdulillah.\n\n3) Dolmen Mall is NOT wheelchair compatible. My dad drives. Once in the parking lot, there are no elevators. What ridiculous planning is this? The escalators are not built for someone on a wheelchair.\n\n4) Port Grand is also not wheelchair friendly. It has these ridiculous separations/gaps and weird stones in the middle of the plain ground.

We went to KhanJi at Port Grand. The first thing that struck us (in a good way) was that it's located at the farthest end of the walk and offers amazingly calm environment.. Our table was ready and it was right at the edge giving us a great view of the port and the light drizzle made the whole environment great..\n\nNow to food, having searched (Yes searched using the option on the top right of the group ;) ) the reviews of the place on SWOT we ordered Peshawari Karahi, Afghani White Karahi, Shish Touk, Chicken Namkeen Boti, and Mutton Ribs..Everything we ordered was ready on time, served hot and everyone loved the food.. They didn't have tandoori Naan in their menu but they granted our wish to serve Naan with the food and they arranged it from some other restaurant.. After the food we ordered Doodh patti and Kashmiri Chai which was really really good and was very refreshing since we all went there straight from work and really needed it..\n\nThe highlight of our experience was the attentiveness of their staff... From the manager who greeted us at the entrance to every waiter everyone was trying their best..\n\nOverall it was a 10/10 experience for us.. Excellent place..

Port Grand is such a blessing for us Karachiites! And I am so happy to see that they're maintaining the place well and the dining/ snacking options are increasing and improving. \nWe were there last Sunday to watch the match. Had a nice long stroll in the food street before settling in the match arena. Boba Tea and Twisty Crispy Fries kept the kids entertained (although I thought Twisty Crispy Fries were quite tasteless, soggy and overpriced), while Irfan Malik and I were tempted by the live cooking station of Thai Me Up. The Tom Yum Goong clear soup with prawns was amazingly pleasing to the senses of smell and taste, and the serving was whoppingly generous! Chicken in Oyster Sauce was also delicious although could've done without the overload of onions in the sauce. Prawns in Red Curry on the other hand was delightfully fragrant and was packed with zest and richness. Overall, Thai Me Up is a great find. The only hitch is that since the food is made to order live in front of you, it takes a bit long... Long enough to make you miss a spectacular Afridi knock of 88 off 48! :( And therefore stressful enough to make you forget to click pictures before devouring it! :/ Anyways.. the place is a welcome addition. Oh and by the way, watching the match there was super-exciting with a very enthusiastic crowd, a live DJ covering the commercial breaks with Jazba Junoon, Josh-e-Junoon, and the likes, and of course, the Dhol walas. It was quite festive and I'm sure tomorrow's match would be quite a treat too. :)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-23T20:45:41+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-24T09:05:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"679913965","name":"Hina Dhanani"},{"id":"674095744","name":"Nadia Rauf"},{"id":"585612434","name":"Chaudhry Abbas"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"691451746","name":"Ayaz Sheikh"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"201004010","name":"Saiem Nasir"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk5OTE4ODMw","before":"Njc5OTEzOTY1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"525928340791654","from":{"name":"Saira Malik","id":"1133719630"},"message":"Nezihe Hussain/ Snaps Har..

I am one happy goose today.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-05T14:51:27+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-05T15:16:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"513232132","name":"Nazia Latif"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTEzMjMyMTMy","before":"NTgzNDQ2OTQ4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"501084839942671","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"Hahaha.

My wife Amrah Jung Tajik and I had ordered in from the Oishi Sushi at Port Grand (a couple of months ago) and were quite satisfied (although Japanese food is not something that one really should order in). \n\nI have to say, we fell in love with the place as soon as we walked in. The d?cor was exquisite: cozy, comfortable and brimming with authentic Japanese Zen. Although the indoor area looked extremely inviting, we decided to take advantage of the weather and sit outside on the floating deck (there is actually a fish-filled pond with a small waterfall beneath the deck!)\n\nThe meal began with complimentary green tea and hot towels. The menu was fairly extensive with all the descriptions, which made it very easy to order. For starters, the steamed dumplings with beef, veges and seafood were juicy and flavorful. We followed up with a fairly conservative choice of prawn tepenyaki and chicken teriyaki with a side order of garlic rice. The food was awesome. If I were to be picky, the only thing I could point out was the garlic rice, which seemed slightly drier than normal. Also, there was no dessert menu, although we were later informed that there was some sort of ice cream available on request. But this hardly affected the overall dining experience. Compared to other Japanese restaurants, Oishi Sushi is also great value for money. \n\nOverall: out-of-this-world environment, excellent food with warm and wonderful service. Hoping to see some interesting desserts on the menu next time we visit. Arigatou gozaimashita (Thank You) Oishi Sushi!

The last visit was luke warm, saddening mostly but I never commented about that earlier. However, I have a few friends actually complaining of the same, sushi looking sad and wilted. Never has this been the case with food at Fuji. Each one of us have lodged our complaints with them, left comments on their comment cards, spoke to the staff about it, just if someone here represents the management, please ask them to give us our old Fuji back. \nTalkign of sushi, in the sushi world we now have Oishi Sushi that closed down from its Port Grand venue and opened up right next to China Kitchen. Second visit today. Again, didn't comment earlier as it could've been beginner's luck but today...WOW. I can easily name it my new favourite sushi place but we can always do with more than one.

Roof Afza, water and Aab-e-Zam Zam were served at the tables. quiet. no crowds or babies. serenity at its prime. and then a treat for senses to add to it all.\n\nIftar was large spinach leaf pakoras, lovely potato slice pakoras, fruit chaat, dahhi phulki, brown bread cold sandwich, caesar salad with honey mustard dressing, \"karachi\" samosas being potato samosas and some other stuff i cannot remmember cuz i didnt have it.\n\n ROMAINE LETTUCE!!!! and sun-drief tomatoes! and shaved parmesann! AT IFTAR!!! *gastro delight*. had platesful of that! i didnt want to look at the food cuz i was simply salivating and devouring the green salad. no really. they had to refill the platter and there were just 7 adults there and i was singlehandedly emptying out the salad platter! :P\n\nall the iftar items were fresh and delicious, as much as they could be.\n\nNow. While fasting, i feel food to be very salty. Its not the cook's fault. its some biological issue. Everything tastes like a jar of salt to me. none of the other 6 adults at the venue found food to be salty. I, on hte other hand, have faced this issue for the last one month. :)\n\n Acknowledging the fact that my taste buds feel a saline overload after breaking my fast, it was food time. No matter which item we tried, it was so flavourful and fresh. Peene Arrabiata: so perfect. Chicken Tarragon. Brown Rice. Rosemary potatoes with herbs and crushed red chillies. sauteed vegetables, chicken in mushroom sauce (?) and pan fried fish. friends also had the chauteaubriand and found everything impeccable.\n\n followed by lovely moist home-made feel chocolate cake with chocoate fudge frosting and sprinkles, accompanied by tea and green tea. it was not remotely dense, so moist that we had over 1 slice each. and i usually prefer my cakes made from cocoa than melted chocolate. \n\noverall such a lovely experience and end to Ramzan. I dont quite like Aylanto but this once, the Bistro did win me over. Sad it was the last iftar otherwise would highly recommend the iftar.\n\nfor the service, the absence of chaos, the attention my team, the food itself: a sure shot  9/10 for me.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-19T17:00:26+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-19T17:00:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"670455362","name":"Faiza Taqi Hassan"},{"id":"582076905","name":"Obaid Sattar"},{"id":"1219800228","name":"Amin Delawalla"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"restaurantName":"Port Grand"},{"id":"165861103465048_422806994437123","from":{"name":"Falak Jalil","id":"520122050"},"message":"I noticed a lot of people are asking about cakes for Eid and nice packaging being a prereq.

Aylanto (yeah it's alphabetical : P) because of freshness of ingredients. and best value for money in fine dining. \n2. BarBQ2night: for its (ISO certified) quality, consistency, cleanliness, & of course their German precision food engineering: P     \n3. CBG: oh this requires an academic thesis, or @least a drawing room discussion, a 1liner is not enough.\n4. Patio: cutesy, warm ambiance, gr8 food and different menu4a change. (no its not alphabetical ;P)\n5. Fujiyama: for the best Japanese in town\n6. Desi: best array of desi flavors under one roof, w/ the good looks & charms of a secret recipe, literally : P\n7. BOTS: best sea food variety under the blue sky, second only to the ocean : P\n8. Log Inn Lounge: for the best chill-out Drinks, food, & conversations on food and of course politics : P\n9. Cafe Gracias: for the best authentic Mexican in town! :P\n10. The upper crust: for having the best fro-yo, panini cheese steaks, belgian chocolate/ RVcake ever.        \n11. The Pakistani at Sheraton- great ambiance, attentive service, love the rose water scented pre-dining hand-rinsing, the post-dining paan and dessert trolley, and a wonderful way to impress family and friends visiting from Abroadzzz.\n12. Crescent Nimco in Bahadurabad- great samosas, chaats, jalebis, chai, kahva, and superb selection of nimco items to take home for when you are feeling like DIY-desi snacks.\n13. This is a tie between Tutti-Fruiti, for its unique self-serve experience and sugar fee varieties, and Berrylicious cuz they are simply sugary-sweet and opening up at Port Grand!\n14. Port Grand- clean and fun atmosphere, with smelly-free views of the harbor, nice walking and shopping, good security, and a decent variety of food for all budgets and tastes. Plus, this allows us to hoot and holler (yeah, i almost became a lawyer, like the loophole?) about Aylanto Bistro and Ghaffar Kabab Hoouse, even though the one in Delhi Mercantile is waaaaay better and more generous!\n15. Dynasty- best Chinese.\n16. Hot n Pepper on Bahria- best malai tikkah rolls. ever!\n17. Butlers- for their 'super-sexxxxy-mocha'- yes, you can go there and ask for it, it's basically extra chocolate syrup..\n18. Olivetto- where else can you get the options for fine-dining or lounge, both with excellent menus?\n19. Koel cafe- for their 'fire and ice' drink, which much like the owner, is the quntissential embodiment of Eastern elegance and taste, met with a certain Western and Worldly sophistication. \n20. The dark brown, unsliced, artisan breads at Hyperstar's bakery. their almond croissants (buttery croissants with actual almond paste inside) too, which are available every now and again on sundays.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-12T08:08:35+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-12T15:46:23+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"582960575","name":"Danyal Achria"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"518308086","name":"Saima Achria"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"689771441","name":"Riffat Fawad Bukhari"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"},{"id":"512091261","name":"Hifza Shah"},{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjAyODQxNzU4","before":"NTgyOTYwNTc1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"396668170384339","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Fawad.

Loved how pretty and clean it was! Spotted the Mr. Burger mobile *happy dance* and the meal was exceptional. Childhood nostalgia was brought on full force with that distinct flavor which only the Mr. Burger patty has. Tried out the chocolate fountain next to the Crepe Factory and loved the assortment of goodies they had for us to drench in chocolate. Bananas, apples, marshmallows (Not the pink and white ones, these were honest-to-goodness marshmallows) and wafers. Moved on to The Bistro after that, since our sweet tooth wasn't quite satisfied, and sat outside, taking advantage of the lovely weather and the gorgeous greenery and comfy seating arrangement they have there. Ordered the Toffee Cream something-something and the divine chocolate lava cake. Forgive me, I don't recall the exact names at the moment, but I can tell you that the chocolate confection gorgeous! The molten chocolate just wouldn't stop flowing from the cake, and the caramel inside the toffee cream thingie added the perfect crunch of sweetness in contrast to the heaviness of the cream. We came back most impressed, both with the food and the atmosphere. Not a bad thing to say about the place.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-09T19:09:37+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-09T19:10:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"677666360","name":"Fazal Gafur"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njc3NjY2MzYw","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"293206740730483","from":{"name":"Nazia Latif","id":"513232132"},"message":"*was gorgeous.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-09T19:10:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MjkzMjA2NzQwNzMwNDgz","before":"MjkzMjA2NzQwNzMwNDgz"}}},"restaurantName":"Port Grand"},{"id":"165861103465048_286930478024776","from":{"name":"Danish Raza","id":"578840177"},"message":"Took away fish and chips from Bahadurabad OPTP..500 Rs for small 2 pieces of fish with small portion of fries and no tarter sauce ( may be the guy forgot to put tarter sauce or something which im not sure) but 500 Rs is expensive!!dont you guys think??","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-30T12:05:08+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-30T20:17:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"804492481","name":"Faisal Hassan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODA0NDkyNDgx","before":"ODA0NDkyNDgx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"286986088019215","from":{"name":"Faisal Hassan","id":"804492481"},"message":"hmm, so bhadurabad's portion size is as small as other branches too..:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-30T13:59:19+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"286998814684609","from":{"name":"Khalid Saleem","id":"580080583"},"message":"Try Mahi Sea Food at Tipu Sultan Road, two filling pieces of fish fillet with fries and two sauces of your choice that too in just Rs. 299. try and let us know how it was :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-30T14:28:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"287062678011556","from":{"name":"Ezwana R-Zaman","id":"701414399"},"message":"we tried it too at OPTP Port Grand.

Prices are about 50% more than the original SAG but when you compare value for money and food quality it is worth it. Kashif the diligent manager personally asked me how was the meal after we finished and advised me to make a reservation before coming according to him it is almost full after 8 pm. Not bad for for all the above mentioned and a bottle of water it came to ONLY fifteen hundred quite reasonable. Highly recommended for BBQ lovers!

Perfect weather and time of day for a leisurely stroll up and down the broadwalk. Decided on the Aylanto Bistro, drawn by its very mod glass facade. Scanning the Menu kept outside when joined by young and intrusive waiter who insisted on giving me a running commentary, having come to the conclusion no doubt that I was faking it and looked like the type who couldn't read. Even more offensive was his casual 'hands in the pocket' manner. Anyway, ordered Shrimp Vegetable Soup-of-the-day. Excellent. Followed it up with a Classic Beef Burger. Thick juicy pattie, and all going well until encountered unchewable bits in the pattie testifying to the presence of 'charbi' in the mincemeat. Terrible! and very irritating having to spit it out. French fries scored passing grade, but the thick creamy white sauce in the burger interfered with the taste of the pattie, and kept it slipping in between the buns at crunch time. Smart, well appointed and clean toilet. But there were issues with the Menu comprising black fonts on dark blue background making for a difficult reading proposition. Black fonts on white backgrounds please. Keep it simple. Also, your printer needs a new cartridge. Could barely make out the bill. And now that you have a view of the Creek, its time to clean up the Creek.
