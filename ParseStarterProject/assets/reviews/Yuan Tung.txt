Clifton and Defense can only dream of such a high turnover barring few exceptions! The waiters were grumpy, carpet was soiled and the person behind the counter was cute little Pakistani Chinese couple wearing slippers and crocs yet no one was complaining. Since we were just three and two of my companions were practically non eaters so whatever I ordered kept my taste preferences in mind..so ordered white hot and sour soup which was ok to be fair ? have had better white hot and sour at Yuan tung during lunch hours..it had overdose of bean sprouts and corn flour and the soup had become little lumpy due to over heating but taste wise it was OK..for starters we ordered bbq squid ? the serving was for four people ? loved it ? perfect taste and I think they have the best recipe for the same no other restaurant comes close to their version. In mains we ordered sweet and sour prawns, crispy chicken chilies and fried rice..regular menu options due to Ammas and sabas eating preferences but the servings were huge and taste wise everything was very good.. This Chinese is our old Chinese of the early 70?s or 80?s which none of the new entrants have been able to replicate even when we enter the premises the aroma takes you back 30 years ago which we miss in our side of the places. I guess someone needs to have their franchise here in Defense and it will be a surefire hit! Price wise it was not average but on the higher side but I guess with the competition and soaring prices of commodities they must have revised their prices also.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-22T05:47:03+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-22T06:00:01+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"641324643","name":"Nadia Moqeet"},{"id":"1432893682","name":"Shahid Zamir Shaikh"},{"id":"884105192","name":"Mahvash Gul Kapadia"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"},{"id":"739670623","name":"Faryal Naqvi"},{"id":"511301771","name":"Eefa Khalid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTExMzAxNzcx","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"524872800897208","from":{"name":"Faryal Naqvi","id":"739670623"},"message":"thier food rocks","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-22T05:49:29+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"524872920897196","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"person \u003d couple :-)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-22T05:50:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"524873400897148","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"My last experience there a couple of years ago was very bad thus I never went again, though I used to love the food at Yuan Tung.
