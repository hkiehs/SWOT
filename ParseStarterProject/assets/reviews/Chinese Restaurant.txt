Comfortable large space, with two storeys (one one is functional for now)\n\nCourteous staff and an attentive chef who came and helped us select our dishes.\n\nThe prawn crackers were fresh and crispy and the three dipping sauces on the table were just divine. \n\nThe two soups ordered were the HOT & SOUR and EIGHT TREASURES. Both were excellent, proper flavourful stock and full of different veggies and mushrooms. I don't think either one had any seafood in it so good for everyone on the table. By the way HUGE servings. One large bowl was good for 6-8 people. And 4 people if they just go for soup. Which I can see my self doing.\n\nThe starters were WASABI PRAWNS, DYNAMITE PRAWNS and CHINESE DRUMSTICKS. Both the prawns were well fried in nice batter. Sauce tasted different and were very nice. For me wasabi can have more of a kick. But great for everyone. The dynamite prawns too could have been spicier but that's an individual palate.\n\nMain course.....HUNAN BEEF, BLACK BEAN SAUCE BEEF, KUNG PAO CHICKEN, FISH IN APPLE SALSA. THE CARBOHYDRATES......CHICKEN CHOWMEIN, CHICKEN FRIED RICE\n\nEach tasted different, was presented well, had distinct flavour. As Luciferz Angel pointed out - the food was neither desiofied nor was it authentic, it was a very well balanced happy medium. Something one can keep going back for again and again.\n\nI am looking forward to my next trip especially for the whole red snapper and to try out the lemon chilie soup.\n\nSince no meal is complete without dessert. We all hopped and skipped (ok drove) to HOTSPOT and had the yummiest ice cream and apple crumble.\n\nAll in all a great meal and a lovely evening with good friends\n\nPS Faisal Naseer will post the food pics.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-27T18:43:04+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-27T21:54:45+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002364449168","name":"Mansoor Hussain"},{"id":"846664538","name":"Afroza Bhamani"},{"id":"7923343","name":"Usman Moon"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"100006770439612","name":"Rehan Ateq"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"516582666","name":"Bushra Farooq"},{"id":"792470170","name":"Luciferz Angel"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzkyNDcwMTcw","before":"MTAwMDAyMzY0NDQ5MTY4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"673327156051771","from":{"name":"Azam Sultan Ahmed","id":"521908454"},"message":"Any Prawn Tempura swotties?
