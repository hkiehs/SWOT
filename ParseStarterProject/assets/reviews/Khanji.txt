First impressions in terms of the environment were quite uncomfortable, considering that there were all men guests and my wife initially felt a little out of place... Eventually we realised that it was a men's night at port grand and men were allowed to enter without the entrance fee... As soon as the table turned it was a relieve to see families coming in Khanji ... Food: ordered a mutton ribs namkeen which was soon converted to mutton ribs spicy as the waiter insisted that we have the spicy version.. Also ordered a half mutton karhai... To be honest the food was okay , nothing great specially if you compare it with the same dishes that you get at BBQ. Tonight and salateen (opp. Ziauddin) .. The ribs were very tough and not served in a very appropriate way. The karhai was again ok.. Not too bad not to good.. ambiance : The place is not very well lit on the tables and it was a bit difficult to see what you are eating... The afghani kava with gur was just fabulous and all three of us enjoyed it ... I would rate the restaurant an overall 5/10 ... But again I think this is a new place and is probably facing teething issues... (Music came on and off . Waiter not well trained and the lights kept going and coming ) I would definitely visit again in sometime to see if they have improved ribs are a weakness for me so it would be definitely worth a shot...  Attaching a pic of the rib - pls note the pic was taken after I had already dug into it.. So the bare ribs you see actually had meet on em ..","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-11T18:02:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-12T07:45:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"100000574081231","name":"Shabina Ali"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"1655946149","name":"Imtiaz Merchant"},{"id":"549647066","name":"Mirza Shan"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100005461631919","name":"Xanam Huxxain"},{"id":"100000114960083","name":"Irfan Lala"},{"id":"874590525","name":"Mustansir Shaherwala"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"ODc0NTkwNTI1","before":"NTI0NDc2NzM1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"665278960189924","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Agree word by word about the karahi, ambiance, tea and your rating.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-11T22:35:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"665440126840474","from":{"name":"Uzma Arif","id":"589340712"},"message":"Aaquib Arif","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T06:35:24+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"665459273505226","from":{"name":"Yasir Billoo","id":"807675696"},"message":"So its overrated according to you Muhammed Ali Raza?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-12T07:38:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"518425942","name":"Muhammed Ali Raza","type":"user","offset":34,"length":17}]},{"id":"665460540171766","from":{"name":"Muhammed Ali Raza","id":"518425942"},"message":"not overrated .....

(My dad is an ultimate nakhray wale uncle:p like the one who calls a steak gosht ka tukda, a pizza 'roti utay boti' and so on) so I always opt for desi with dad since he tends to be very particular with expense directly proportional to taste! Went for an early dinner to Khanji and were seated immediately (1. the weather was lovely, I loved how I ate desi with those back support chairs I could sink into after a long tedious day). Moving to the menu, really extensive, efficiently put together... Ordered Mutton Peshaweri Karhai, Shish Taouk...on asking about the serving we were told there would be 6 pieces so we order yet another 2 items (we dint know they wudnt be tiny pieces, instead king kong pieces) ordered fish tikka and Namkeen Boti. Dad was disappointed for no tandoori roti and only having chapati as an option! Waiter immediately said they can get from another eatery and so we ordered both\nPumpkin Meetha(I don't eat pumpkins, cant say much :))\nThe POST MORTEM:\nMutton Peshaweri Karhai: Nothing like those al habib or Kolachi tastes! Distinct flavors, loved how tender the meat was (I do not eat mutton apart from home but i surprisingly did!). Maybe the right tinge of Peshawer 10/10\n\nNamkeem Boti: I thought they'd be somehow salty (Namkeem wohi hota hai na?) But I think well marinated Chicken with an unbelievably managed execution, 10/10\n\nShish Taouk: A different version of Malai Boti, perhaps with some arabic spices maybe? (y m i being a chef? lol I'd rate it 8/10)\n\nFarmaishi Chapatti : Loved it, literally chapati had some peshaweri khan baba ki rooh in it maybe?

The formal SWOT RATING will be done after my 3rd visit. But my first impressions will be as follows.\n\nDisclaimer:- review on three places so will be a little long, but hopefully easy to follow.\n\nCAFEELA.\nGreat concept of combining all the popular cuisines in one menu and putting in a dine-in at one the posh locations in Zamzama. Great flavours, attentive service and very easy on the wallet. A must repeat soon - my fav items - starters mein sev poori, paani poori, brain masala crispy laal atae ki naan and a glass of lassi. \n\nKHANJI\nfantastic ambiance, one of the best locations on PORT GRAND. attentive and efficient staff - also very accommodating (they actually went got us an order from another place since we had a hard core aalu-eater wi us) and great food. The items I would recommend (on just my first trip) are the mutton boti and mutton ribs (we had numkeen and I look forward to the spicy ones next time) the chicken thu well made unfortunately never scores well with me unless exceptional. The elaichee chai was just amazing and will be even more fabulous when the weather gets colder.\n\nSATTAR BUKSH\ngreat location and was access. Funky decor and an interesting place that has the potential of becoming the favourite hangout for all those looking for a place with wifi and good chai/coffee/drinks. Since they are in their infancy days (not even weeks) I will over look the few glitches. The few things that were tried today and recommended were - the bhinnote bunkebab, the daam bun kebab, the daal chawal (but didnt like the shaami kebabs) the thyme chicken, and the lassi (hmmmm yes I kinda like that over milkshake and will order it anywhere I see it on the menu) I love the little paaparde (papadoms) they served with the bun kebabs and the  best green chutney I have had outside my house. \n\nAll in all I am looking forward to SWOTTING all these places again and soon. Will rate them once I have been at least 3 times to each","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-15T19:38:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T05:49:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"715251102","name":"Sophia Nazeer"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"701414399","name":"Ezwana R-Zaman"},{"id":"100003247463950","name":"Murk Mustafa"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"100002814495361","name":"Studioc UpCake"},{"id":"592090015","name":"Javeria Ahmed"},{"id":"100000675092971","name":"Fahim Farooq"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"574052713","name":"Harun Aziz"},{"id":"500778016","name":"Hammad Munir"},{"id":"100003303131853","name":"Samad Fansia"},{"id":"611294921","name":"Irum Chaudhry"},{"id":"1292953231","name":"Aakash Kumar"},{"id":"709724895","name":"Annie Abbasi"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"741205131","name":"Maleeha Ahmad Qureshi"},{"id":"1324057559","name":"Safi Ahmed"},{"id":"739231013","name":"Aiya Quli"},{"id":"719028214","name":"Rehmat Ebrahim"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzE5MDI4MjE0","before":"NzE1MjUxMTAy"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_619277281456759/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzE5MDI4MjE0"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619278494789971","from":{"name":"Mahrukh Abbasi","id":"519901828"},"message":"i enjoyed their tea menu:  cheeni rok ke, patti thok ke, and elaichi chai :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-15T19:40:59+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619279201456567","from":{"name":"Humera Jawed","id":"644820164"},"message":"But their tea is for 175 dunt u think so it's too over price dey r not sitting in any 5 star hotel dey should cut down deir prices","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-15T19:43:28+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619281048123049","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Humera Jawed as I said there were glitches.
