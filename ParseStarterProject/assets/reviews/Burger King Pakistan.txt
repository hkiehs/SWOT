That's what going into the food business is all about: It's about returning that kindness and trust someone has for you and responding with the best quality possible for that money. I can't judge BK until I try it myself (maybe in a week or so when the crowds lessen a bit). Let's see how it goes. P.s. Have been a McDonald's fan ever since a kid and although we know the barrage of criticism and jokes McDonald's gets in the commercial aspect I respect them because they always maintain the quality and product, and that's especially important here in Pakistan. Only once or twice I had a bad experience with McDonald's here (stale bun) in many years.

It was home to a culinary delight of mythical proportions, called The Whopper. As time passed and consumerism ruled, places similar to Burger King started their slow but deliberate invasion of our fine country. However, as they came one after another, Burger King remained elusive. And as with all things elusive, they more it played hard to get, the more we craved it. When we travelled abroad, we would have BK at every available opportunity - in some cases, people even went to extreme lengths like buying it from the DXB airport (where it was conveniently located near gate 210, where the morning Karachi flight invariably was) so that it could be brought back and enjoyed with the family. \n\nAnd then one day, there was an ad in a newspaper, advertising jobs at? gasp? Burger King Pakistan! It has been a journey of epic anticipation, waiting (thankfully not with baited breath) until today, when I lined up with many others in the glaring sun outside BK Nishat to have my ever favourite - the Double Whopper. The queue moved relatively fast and in about 30 minutes, I was in. Another 20 minutes and I was at the counter, where I found out, to my utter dismay, that there is no Double Whopper. A minor misstep, I thought, and promptly ordered three Whopper meals and two Chicken Royale meals. There was some confusion about whether fries are being served to customers or not, as there was a shortage and perhaps fries were only being provided to customers who had placed their orders well before mine. But that was quickly sorted and I was assured that five lovely packets of fries would accompany the burgers. There was a wait of 15-20 minutes for the food to be served, although it felt like eternity. And then, suddenly, there it was: a Whopper, in front of me, in Pakistan. Fast forward twenty minutes and there you have wrappers on the trays, empty Pepsi glasses and fry packets. The fries, by the way, are absolutely mind-glowingly good. Its hard to believe they're from a fast food outlet. The burgers? are a slightly different, more complicated story. They were good, but as we left, I couldn't help but think that the whole experience was somewhat underwhelming. So I really thought about it - yes, it wasn't a Double Whopper which is what I always have, but that wasn't it. And its not as though the burgers were bad: they're just like BK everywhere else. The size is good, its a nice filling meal without making you feel stuffed. Even the Pepsi was really good :) But the problem is this: when I first visited Burger Shack, I couldn't wait to go back. And sadly, I don't feel the same way about BK. In fact, I'm not really feeling the need to go back. And I think the reason is this: we've been spoiled by offerings like Burger Shack. The advent of the gourmet burger into our lives means that as good as the Whopper is, its just not good enough. I know I'm not alone in comparing Burger King to Burger Shack - at least four people in BK were doing the same thing. \n\nIn conclusion: Burger King is, or rather, the Whopper, Angus and Chicken Royale are just like their foreign counterparts. I'm sure that the others, including the Swiss and Mushroom will be just as good, whenever they are launched. The onion rings too, when they become available, should be good. They're having a lot of management related issues right now and the staff is clearly under-trained, but that will be fixed over time. You can go to BK and know that you'll get the same taste you get everywhere else - just don't go expecting BK to blow the local offerings out of the water. Because, as I'm unbelievably proud to say, the local offerings are better. Which reminds me, I haven't had Burger Shack in a while...","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-06T12:20:33+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-07T12:06:34+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"569196654","name":"Maria Sultan"},{"id":"786471893","name":"Sana Ismail Ahmed"},{"id":"648091964","name":"Saba Sadia"},{"id":"732705760","name":"Nishat Aleem Khan"},{"id":"752174107","name":"Urooj Imran"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1371113498","name":"Danyal Sopariwala"},{"id":"571881277","name":"Sna Nm"},{"id":"565157664","name":"Sarah Farooq"},{"id":"100000223684855","name":"Sana A.
