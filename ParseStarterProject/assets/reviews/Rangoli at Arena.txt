Hot & Sour Soup, Bread Basket, a good variety of salads, main courses consisting of prawns, fish, beef mince and chicken in Desi, Chinese, Italian & Continental cuisine including BBQ and a good spread of desserts.  Pricing is pretty attractive @ Rs. 649/- per head and includes a coupon for a game at Arena.  Can easily compare to the likes of Chandi at PC and Al Bustan at Sheraton.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-02-20T12:46:51+0000","updated_time":"2013-02-20T16:10:26+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1039106808","name":"Shaban Butt"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"717760658","name":"Irfan Ismail"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njk0MjM4NzQy","before":"MTAzOTEwNjgwOA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"507978712586617","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"do they have the outdoor bbq still, or is it bbq'd food that is served indoors with the rest of the buffet?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T13:02:37+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"507990095918812","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"I had it indoors this afternoon Snaps Har","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T13:43:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har","type":"user","offset":32,"length":9}]},{"id":"507990645918757","from":{"name":"Snaps Har","id":"100001456059095"},"message":"awww man! a par tof their buffet was outdoors, where the bbq would be done live... had good sajji, good chapli kababs and ouzi and mandi... i guess they ended it.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T13:44:50+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"508009612583527","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"I had lunch there Snaps Har, maybe at dinner time they have the outdoor BBQ.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T14:36:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har","type":"user","offset":18,"length":9}]},{"id":"508038835913938","from":{"name":"Shamsi Zia","id":"1367979764"},"message":"AAM  lets plan next week lunch  at Rangoli","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-02-20T16:10:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA4MDM4ODM1OTEzOTM4","before":"NTA3OTc4NzEyNTg2NjE3"}}},"restaurantName":"Rangoli at Arena"}]}
