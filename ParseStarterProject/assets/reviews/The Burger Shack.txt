Tried the newly launched Burger Lab soon after its launch today. Ordered a Double Patty Mushroom Cloud Burger which had their own cooked mushroom sauce, a cheese slice and two big fat beef patties sandwiched in the Lab's Bun (that's what the menu board said although I saw them using the 'Hyperstar k Buns'). The meat was juicy and succulent in taste while the freshly made mushroom sauce was just in the right quantity as not to spoil the taste of beef patties. The spice level was on the lower side which karachiites would probably not like. The bun, however, was a major turnoff which was dry and crumbling (this has always been a problem with Hyperstar's Bread). I was at least expecting BL's freshly baked buns. The prices were competitive to all the local offerings with an option to add on the patties for just Rupees 80  for one.\n\nThe people on other side of the counter were friendly and well informed who took the order patiently despite the rush outside. The meal was ready within 15 minutes, although the waiting time communicated initially was about 20. They had mistakenly delivered a single patty burger which was later compensated with another double patty one (yeah, you got it right, I got two burgers :P). I will give them a benefit of doubt because of the rush.\n\nOverall experience 7.5 on 10. Only if they start using better quality buns and retain their quality, they might actually give The Burger Shack a run.","type":"photo","created_time":"2014-01-08T18:26:46+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-08T19:14:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"743148089","name":"Asad Abdul Muhammad"},{"id":"515483096","name":"Samar Yasir"},{"id":"556128383","name":"Taha Faruqui"},{"id":"500778016","name":"Hammad Munir"},{"id":"623717272","name":"Anum Abrar Ahmed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjIzNzE3Mjcy","before":"NzQzMTQ4MDg5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"679520725432414","from":{"name":"Omer Naeem","id":"771972485"},"message":"n whr exactly is it? it is for the love of food r BL's tht good kay ur writing a review whn infact u shud b studying for exam?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-01-08T18:45:14+0000","like_count":7,"user_likes":false},{"id":"679522832098870","from":{"name":"Abdul Basit Memon","id":"537798684"},"message":"Lol .

The idea was to find a winner amongst these 3, and then further extend the competition.\n\nBefore leaving home (G.Jauhar) I ordered MYOB and asked for their Mushroom Madness, which I was to pick from Boat Basin, since that is their only take-away spot. I reached the decided spot about 10 minutes before the MYOB-rider was to show up. He reached the place on time, and to do justice, I had decided earlier to eat the burger the instant I receive it, just to remove any ambiguities of it getting cold/stale etc. Mushroom Madness was a decent enough burger. I had major issues with it's bun, which made it's duty to annoy me till the very end. The bun kept on breaking and crumbling, and the sauces made it extremely soggy; more like a wet-dipped bread. The burger itself was nice enough, in terms of taste.\n\nNext up was The Burger Factory. My intentions were to try the mushroom-topped burgers of the 3 joints, but knowing that TBF doesn't have one, I opted for Ironman Double. It was again a nice burger, eaten as soon as it was served. The amount of cheese did justice to it's description, and the patty was comparatively MUCH softer than the MYOB patty. The MYOB patty was a bit firm. So till now, MYOB vs. TBF and TBF won.\n\nAnd finally, the last stop (after having a Hazelnut Cappuccino from Espresso) was The Burger Shack. Ordered the Shack Shroom Double, and yes there was a small queue (TBF was deserted). Received the order in 17 minutes or so. Closed my eyes, dug in for the first bite.\n*swoosh*\nI was in an entirely different landscape. With soft buns floating around me, the right amount of mushroom topping, not making the bun go soggy and a pain to deal with. And then my palates detected the first hint of the TBS-beef. Sold. Absolutely sold all over again. I was a TBS-loyal ever since I first had it, but when going out on today's expedition, my aim was to give every place a fair chance, and not be biased. I opened my eyes and the reason for the queue outside TBS everytime I went there was answered by the bite of Shack Shroom in my mouth.\n\nMYOB vs. TBF vs. TBS\nHands down, of these three, The Burger Shack is the winner.\nMy next venture would be to compare The Burger Shack and Burger Inc.\n\nEat on people!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-17T19:01:13+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-20T07:18:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"549030715","name":"Rawfay Ahmed"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"688469251","name":"Azeem Dada"},{"id":"751128592","name":"Talha Rashid"},{"id":"716686563","name":"Maaz Sarfaraz"},{"id":"1072105633","name":"Fatima Zaidi"},{"id":"635810442","name":"Kiran Afzal"},{"id":"514392526","name":"Mahnaz Fahad"},{"id":"827180267","name":"DrJoyo Tabsheer"},{"id":"751030900","name":"Zoha Manzar"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100001640822737","name":"Khadija Jatoi"},{"id":"100003247463950","name":"Murk Mustafa"},{"id":"100000003997863","name":"Adnan Jawed Amin"},{"id":"517317558","name":"Muhammad Jawad"},{"id":"652785155","name":"Marium Asim"},{"id":"640740531","name":"Reshma Chhotani"},{"id":"804995006","name":"Muhammad Naseer"},{"id":"1580010637","name":"Ayesha Ahsan"},{"id":"882650316","name":"Sabah Shaikh"},{"id":"528034021","name":"Sikander Majeed"},{"id":"576731107","name":"Shahzad Nayani"},{"id":"1373776544","name":"Samia Waheed"},{"id":"667017252","name":"Taha Javed"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzI3NzkxMjA1","before":"NTQ5MDMwNzE1"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_668159803235173/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzI3NzkxMjA1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"668223359895484","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Excellent read and great review!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-17T21:48:13+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"668223683228785","from":{"name":"Rabeet Rao","id":"749204552"},"message":"Much obliged ma'am. :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-17T21:48:52+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"668225179895302","from":{"name":"Nabeel Kazi","id":"733018407"},"message":"That is pretty hardcore of you Rabeet.

We were six people and each of us ordered different flavors. Other than that we ordered onion rings, shack loaded fries, tangy loaded fries, peanut butter shake, lemon breezer and shack 'a? bon from the dessert.  After a long wait of approx 30 mins we finally got the order.\n\nFull shack house from beef and honey mustard crunch from chicken are highly recommended. Smokey crunch was too simple and plain to be called smokey plus shack shroom from which I expected to have mushrooms hardly have any, though the burger was good.  Besides that all the flavors were worth trying. \n\nOnion rings were so good even the fries were. Tangy loaded fries were good in quantity and with the same expectation when I opened up the box of shack loaded fries, which costs the same; to my surprise more than half of it was empty. It hardly had number of fries. I felt sorry for my little brother!\n \nPeanut butter shake was so yummy that I was continuously asking for a sip from my sister. I found lemon breezer bitter in taste. And there I felt bad for not ordering shake for me.\n\nThe dessert I ordered was looking gorgeous and I was pretty excited to finish my burger and taste it, but to my big disappointment it tasted like a bakery wala bun that we dip in chai and eat so it do not dry our throats. It?s the picture of shack a?bon which was completely dry from inside. No one liked it and I?m still left with this! \n\nIf it?s only about burgers then I would give 8/10. But to the overall experience I would give 6.5/10.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-10-20T11:17:11+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-20T18:09:18+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"501478359","name":"Mohammad Mikail Soomro"},{"id":"100000522564819","name":"Imran Bahadur"},{"id":"517920558","name":"Imran Khan"},{"id":"100004078952313","name":"Shazia Asghar"},{"id":"100003216046346","name":"Shezi Memon"},{"id":"574362941","name":"Murtaza Naqvi"},{"id":"100002971695699","name":"Syeda Tehseen Zehra Naqvi"},{"id":"1208451657","name":"Noman Babar"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"645099594","name":"Mujahid Iqbal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjQ1MDk5NTk0","before":"NTAxNDc4MzU5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"637157553002065","from":{"name":"Ovais Khan Yousufzai","id":"1492617104"},"message":"Ismai ek makhi daldayteen tow aur maza ajata 3:)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T12:37:24+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637158923001928","from":{"name":"Zahra Sharif","id":"549360489"},"message":"Price bracket?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T12:43:17+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637159199668567","from":{"name":"Omer Ali Khan","id":"660370720"},"message":"Troll!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-10-20T12:44:17+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"637161046335049","from":{"name":"Aqsa Shah","id":"1088748635"},"message":"Zahra Sharif The overall bill was rs.2580, which is quite reasonable.

Got there to find 3 people waiting in line with the counter closed and a sign on the monitor that the staff is on a '10 minute break' on account of isha namaz. Fair enough. The wait stretched to 15 minutes and the line stretched by a further 10 persons behind me, on to the road. At this point a couple of people left the line and I asked the guard how much longer, to which he replied \"Abhi to jamaat khari hee nahee huee, time lagayga\" pointing to the adjacent masjid. Not wanting to wait any longer, I left. Suggestion: Whereas I (or the customers) may understand that you want to close shop and attend prayers, and if this will take 30 mins end to end, just say so! No point in saying 10 mins and keep customers hanging. \n\nTook the car around the block to find Big Thick Burgers and placed my order there. Nice cosy outlet with seating (BTB:1 , TBS: 0), order was ready in 20 mins (BTB:2 , TBS:0) and the burgers (most wanted & mushroom cheese) were grilled to perfection!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-31T17:46:52+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-02T01:07:20+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"592867967","name":"Saad Ahmed Shah"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"594796590","name":"Ufaq Ashfaque"},{"id":"783958571","name":"Rabia Rajput"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"827180267","name":"DrJoyo Tabsheer"},{"id":"1471255974","name":"Agha Athar Hussain"},{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNTQ4OTcxNjE3","before":"NTkyODY3OTY3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"612230668828087","from":{"name":"Nizam Uddin Khan Salarzai","id":"724174458"},"message":"Ozzy burgers khana chor dai!

Its just amazing how Mr Big with Egg n Cheese is perfect every time . It feels like they have time frozen the entire process for the last 20 years . Succulent , Flavoursome , Juicy Satisfaction all wrapped up in One little Piece of Heaven. I'd rate it 12/10 , 2 extra points for that smile on my face every time I take the first bite.\n\n2- Al Asif Square : Though a bit risky for some fellows but to be honest the place was packed . We had food at MADINA RESTAURANT which is located inside Al Asif Square and to some people's surprise there were few families around there as well ( well to do families at that ) enjoying food , the atmosphere was friendly we were greeted as warmly as always . We had the famous Dumba Boti , Afghani Pulao , Namkeen Gosht and Karahi.  Now i don't want to waste time in describing the brilliance of food . \nThat is the best Authentic Afghani food out there, Period , 11/10 . One extra point for the Afghan brethren for their every gracious hospitality. \n\n3- Tayyabi Restaurant : Located in Hussainabad. It one of the few unsung heroes of Karachi. We ordered Prawn Masala , KataKat , Chicken Chargha Fry, Malai Boti and Tikkas . Food was served a bit late as they prepare all the dishes fresh and from the scratch. \nPrawn Masala is one of the best in town as the prawns just melt in your mouth and mix with that zesty masala . THE DAMN ! \n\nKatakat and Chicken Chargha fry are good too . All in all yet another place you wont come out unsatisfied or cheated, EVER . 8/10 . -2 for the stolen side mirror of my friend's car from the parking :P\n\n4-  The Burger Shack: I have Shake Shack every week so it did not impressed me much. But i'd like to commend the owner for doing the best damn possible thing by cloning a famous international franchise's menu and making it possible to offer taste in it as well. I was not disappointed to say the least. 7/10\n\n5- Cafeela : Simply put , Zahoor bhai you rock . Okra Jalfarezi , Malai Boti , Nathiya Gali Qeema , Shahi Tukray , Chicken Yakhni Pulao are all yum. One of the best value for money in town. \n\nI am a safe eater and a Desi at heart as I get to eat really yummy mum cooked food and these are few of the places I go to eat or get food delivered when I want to eat out. Flying out tonight . Will Miss Karachi as I always do . Tada !","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-25T12:11:15+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-27T10:31:04+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"644528865","name":"Shirin Imani"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"647407601","name":"Syeda Rizvi"},{"id":"655910358","name":"Moiz Kazmi"},{"id":"549477264","name":"Junaid Wasti"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"1521133249","name":"Maouz Qazi"},{"id":"504239316","name":"Hala Qureshi"},{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"591166408","name":"Faisal M.

Little did I know that when I was told \"20 minutes\" till I get my order, that actually meant almost 45 minutes.\n\nAfter placing my order (in a hurry because the gentleman at the counter kept rushing me and complaining that he would miss his prayers because of me) I returned to the car and noticed that he had punched in a different burger on my receipt. When I returned to the counter (immediately), the person insisted that he had already confirmed the order and could not make any changes.\n\n20 minutes later, when I returned to collect my food, the cashier decided that he would be nice enough and correct my order the way I had initially intended for it to be. What he forgot to tell me was that this would take ANOTHER 20 minutes.\n\nWhile I waited for the remaining time, I met other disgruntled customers who's orders had either been messed up or simply left incomplete (the same day and also in the past). The few who hadn't experienced such troubles, were just annoyed by the ridiculously long wait time and attitude of the staff.\n\nI finally got my order and headed back home to eat it (45minutes after I had first greeted the cashier).\n\nThe much talked about 'juicy' burgers were so dry, that I had to pour in some of their dip/sauce to make it better. (They tasted great, but were extremely dry\nTuba Arshad, who had previously dined at The Burger Shack when it had just opened, also agreed that the burger was very dry and didn't taste as it had the previous time.\nThe peanut butter shake tasted REALLY good, but was a bit too thin in consistency for my liking.\n\nHere are a few things for the managers to keep in mind:\n\nIf you have a namaaz break policy, then it would be best to shut the counter and stop taking any orders during the specified time. I don't like being rushed into ordering my meal (as were the customers before and after me), getting it wrong, and then being blamed for your staff missing their prayers. If I want the burger bad enough, I will respect your policy and place my order after your prayers.\n\nDouble, triple check the order BEFORE the customer leaves the counter. (It has clearly been proven that you repeatedly keep getting this part wrong)\n\nThe customer is always right.\n\nOrders should be processed in the same order as they were placed. I don't like it when the guy after me (or the person after him) gets his food before I do.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-08T05:37:40+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-08T17:30:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"505341447","name":"Quratulain Syeda"},{"id":"549621042","name":"Marium Soomro"},{"id":"726361084","name":"Rabia Hassan"},{"id":"553586655","name":"Ambreen Intizar"},{"id":"780902784","name":"Faisal Naseer"},{"id":"591827743","name":"Tuba Arshad"},{"id":"7958572","name":"Faizan Kazi"},{"id":"502297291","name":"Zainab Abidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTAyMjk3Mjkx","before":"NTA1MzQxNDQ3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"515737108477444","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"For the last point.
