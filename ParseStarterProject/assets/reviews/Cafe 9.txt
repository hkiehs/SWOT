And all I can say is that the food and the presentation really made my day. Very tasteful steak and cooked to perfection. Good portion, fresh veggies and very nice mashed potato to compliment the meal. Sorry I don't make portfolios of my food so no pictures but this trip was super satisfactory to pull me again and again I'm sure. Even the complimentary salad that come to the table within a minute of us settling down, was super fresh. Very generous staff and a calm and pleasant environment. I'd rate 8/10 for environment, 9/10 for service and staff and certainly 9.5/10 for the food that we had. Highly recommended and I was pulled to Cafeela honestly after the pictures Mr. Merchant Abid posted of both these dishes.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-16T17:31:01+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-16T18:56:07+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002653854221","name":"Zahoor Ahmed"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100005334067873","name":"Maqsood Ahmed"},{"id":"100001456059095","name":"Snaps Har"},{"id":"512523968","name":"Adil Aziz"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"602863744","name":"Ayesha Khan"},{"id":"1076285215","name":"Qamarunnisa Asim"},{"id":"646760193","name":"Rehma Tirmizey"},{"id":"558690791","name":"Zehra Zaidi"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI5MzYxNzk3","before":"MTAwMDAyNjUzODU0MjIx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619724121412075","from":{"name":"Merchant Abid","id":"840619510"},"message":"Glad you liked the food.

Complementary bread with garlic, and cucumber n some other veg with cheese mayo dip served. Both were good n I would rate them 8/10. We ordered cesar salad, the chicken quantity was very less for the hefty price. 6/10 Crepe champs elysees was good but overall not very filling quantity, 9/10. \n\nNow comes the steak. Ordered djonnaise steak, I was told it will be local tenderloin but I guess it was fillet mignon since the width was about 1.5 inch but the size was really small making it a total of 200 something grams. I ordered medium well but it looked pretty much medium, I requested them for it to be cooked more since and they changed it without any hesitation. 9/10. BUT it still does not beat the steak I ate in dxb, not even close and not that big as well.\n\nDidn't order the choc lava cake which was another reason to go there cuz I saw the dish being served on another table and it looked too tiny with vanilla icecream. \nOverall a good experience but too expensive for the quantity (2800 for 3 dishes of which 2 are starters). 10% service charge was applied but since it wasn't written anywhere I asked the manager to deduct it which he did, saving me 200+ rupees.

The stir fry along with the steamed rice tasted fine but then again it was nothing to write home about. Everyone I went with had a problem with the portion size and some of the food tasted bland as well so we eventually left feeling unfulfilled, disgruntled and hungry.

Bland food, value for money, a little extra, small things to complete a dish and personalized service are VERY IMPORTANT to make a new joint take off.My advice to restaurant owners is don't look at reaping back what you have sown the first day the restaurant opens, give it some time, twelve to eighteen months, give it your best shot, establish yourself in the market, address customer complaints, make changes and woo customers, who may be disgruntled and not completely satisfied. We have seen so many success stories, which had quite some negative reviews early, like CBG, like Olivetto, Okra, Cafe 9, The Deli, and many others, their owners and management took pains and worked hard to redefine their image and achieve success and carve a niche for themselves. The owners and operators of Cafe 44 and Xanders need to realize that Rome was certainly not conquered in one day and customer is the King, the only way that they can achieve success is continuous evolution and improvement. We can SWOT it anytime but the owners and management should commits to fine tuning and bring themselves up to the required level. I hope this topic stands concluded from critique point of view.
