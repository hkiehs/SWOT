The food tasted good, good variety though i would have preferred a couple of more meat based dishes, its too much vegetarian oriented. I tasted Dhokla for the first time and simply LOVED it.\nAlso it was quite economical as there is a buy one thali get one free offer going on, so we ended up paying less than 500 per head.

Not just a minute or two late, but I got my orders in 45-55 minutes instead of the promised (maximum) 30 minutes. Each time I lodged complains, but the pathetic management did not pay heed. A week back, I ordered and as usual it came late so I returned the food. Tonight I ordered again (yes, it was quite stupid to order again) and told the order taker that I would NOT pay a rupee AND would take the order if it came even a minute late. To which he said that it would be there inside 30 minutes. \n\nAs usual, the order arrived in 48 minutes. I live on main Shahrae Faisal, max 5-8 min drive from the Tariq Road McDonalds. I told the rider and the manager (on phone) that I would not pay, as I had specifically told so to the order taker. The manager had the guts to ask his rider to stay outside my house as long as I don't pay. The guy waited there for 30 minutes before I paid him. \n\nMcDonalds is quite pathetic but I ordered since it is near my place and I was late for dinner. I assume that being food lovers, most of you don't eat it anyway, but if you do, I'd say stay away specially from ordering it!
