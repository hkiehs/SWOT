Surprise was the Italian bread pudding......which was absolutely fantabulous, not the usual caramalized gloop available at majority of the places floating in a caramal sheera. \n\nThis was light and airy, still moist and gooey baked in a bed of apples.

With all the hype and good reviews we were expecting to be blown away by the food. Unfortunately the entire experience was just average. My husband and I were the first ones to reach so we asked the gentlemen who greeted us for a table of 6 plus a high chair and he was very sweet and arranged it all and got us seated within 5 minutes. When the other couples arrived we ordered the following. Burrito Bowl, Chicken with Waffles, Burger with Blue Cheese, Ceasar Salad, a pasta dish ( penne with an white alfredo-ish sauce), Thai red curry with rice, and two pizzas.. yes we overdid it a bit :).. All the food was ok EXCEPT... the burrito bowl. I hate using negative words for food but there is no other way to describe it.. it was horrible... The rice was under-flavored and kichdri textured, there was a thousand island like sauce on top which didn't belong and the worst part... there were mangoes..not the firm slightly tangy mangoes but soft mushy dessert type mangoes..ruined the taste...the famed pizza was deemed \"ok\" by those who had it. The service was a little slow in terms of the time between the mains and desserts even though we ordered dessert halfway trough to save time.We had the chocolate tart which was excellent as well as the Nutella Cake, and waffles..the tart was the highlight of the trip. There was nothing horribly wrong (expect the burrito bowl) but it was an average experience food wise for us.

It shouldn't  be mixed together like a pastry but be like a chooran. Peel and cut maybe 4 or 5 apples into quarters then slice them finely and lay the slices at the bottom of a lightly buttered dish. Cover the slices with the flour/butter/sugar mix and bake in an oven until the topping is crispy and golden, serve with cream or custard. The topping should be enough to completely cover the apples.

With no frills or fancy of fine dining, fresh clean ingredients generously used. When a dish said emmental it had emmental, when it said blue cheese it HAD blue cheese. \n\nI hope I don't break hearts but the ciabatta here is as good as it is anywhere in gorgeous Italy, no one not even Upper Crust came close to it. They are making all their breads themselves and their burger buns were what all the restaurants that are serving burgers are looking for.\n\nThe pics are up for all the food so individual reviews there. \n\nJust a warm welcome to the Duo who have brought us yet another wonderful place to dine-in in.\n\nMissed some of our usual gang members. But the three of us ate for 5 people and I am happy to say I have killed my diet on its 5 day - yippee","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-02T19:05:04+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-03T12:24:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"721139253","name":"Rashna Gandhi"},{"id":"1464463541","name":"Mehreen Farhan"},{"id":"529140915","name":"Fatima Shekhani"},{"id":"514292991","name":"Marium Hosein"},{"id":"739231013","name":"Aiya Quli"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"724121365","name":"Rida Mansoor Teli"},{"id":"622624323","name":"Mansoor Teli"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"685820726","name":"Mehmood Hamid Hussain"},{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"},{"id":"1544452028","name":"Sana Wasif"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"100001145343143","name":"Javed Gul"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTQ1MzkwMTMxMw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTEzMzcxOTYzMA\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"552181888166299","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"The brothers will have to tag themselves.
