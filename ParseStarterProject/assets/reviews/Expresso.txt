Over the years, I have gone to Expresso and never really found the food particularly exceptional. Thus, when people kept talking about ordering from there, I was beyond skeptical and have recently realized, unfairly so. Given my love of club sandwiches, and having been spoilt by the Log Inn version, I have found it hard to find a club sandwich that I have liked as much. Many have been tried, some decent and some not. Nothing has approached that Log Inn Club. However, recently Mariyam wanted a sandwich of some sort and we ended up ordering her a blackened chicken one from Expresso and to give her company, hesitatingly I ordered the club. What a revelation! Both sandwiches were pretty good ... and the club was fairly comparable to my favourite Log Inn one. Just to make sure it wasn't a fluke (wink, wink), we ordered the same sandwiches again. This time, they sent my club but got Mariyam's sandwich wrong and sent roast beef instead. I called them and within 30 seconds, the gentleman on the phone had checked and confirmed that they had made a mistake and I was off the phone in less than a minute with a replacement sandwich promised and delivered ASAP! Good customer service and good food ... I was eating my opinion, and hereby acknowledge that I was unfairly hesitant to order food from Expresso! Finally, given these two good experiences, and my penchant for being a creature of habit, we ordered again ... with Mariyam trying the chicken burger while my club sandwich remained a constant. She really enjoyed the burger and every time that I have had the club, it has been fresh, well put together and tasty! While I must say that the Log Inn Club is still #1 on my list, Expresso has certainly become a worthy challenger. Kudos Expresso ... I guess I missed out all this time ... but no more!!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-05-25T15:23:38+0000","updated_time":"2013-05-25T18:36:25+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"633230637","name":"Mahnaz Hadi"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"579933313","name":"Ali Daudpota"},{"id":"503886516","name":"Bilal Hameed"},{"id":"624168828","name":"Adil Mohammed"},{"id":"100001052122235","name":"Xarrin Faizi"},{"id":"553350590","name":"Faizan Chaghtai"},{"id":"629361797","name":"Waleed Muhammad"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"100002408096899","name":"Syeda Amna Kazmi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNDA4MDk2ODk5","before":"NjMzMjMwNjM3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"561985313852623","from":{"name":"Mariam Lary","id":"1089603658"},"message":"There is no X in espresso...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-05-25T15:24:24+0000","like_count":6,"user_likes":false},{"id":"561985870519234","from":{"name":"Raheel Masood","id":"502393296"},"message":"mea culpa, mea culpa ...

Had a normal unda toast naashta and 4 bites of the refrigerated leftover burger from BURGER INC. have to say noot baad..seriously next time I am ordering two so I have a cold for naashta. \n\nThen the hard hard work at the clinic.....desperately needed good coffee and had a meeting so went off too LAL's \n\nMadiha Sultan Tai.....really good mug of large vanilla latte. Good beans. Tried 4 different macaroons.....pistachio, chocolate, lemon, strawberry....the experience was very nice. The macaroons themselves were perfect found the filling in each a little insipid, met MST and she said that it was no issue next time that will be corrected. First time into LAL's it's so pretty and I love some of their pastries I have already had those and didn't want to add to the calories......also had a little something waiting at home.....\n\nCame home to find that an order of brownies were waiting from Taha Zoeb....and OH MY GOD.....Perfect ones..... Haider Zaidi you need to try these to understand what I was saying and why I suggested a few tweaks. Will bring some over tomorrow Haroon Leghari.\n\nHad promised that I will Eat for a Cause.... So called GinSoy for a reservation for 2..... They were booked so called up China Kitchen instead and at 8:30 met Mahvash Siddiqi Khan there. Since just two offs and we are both adventurous we thought hmmmm lets have the duck. So with that one beef ribs ( yes I can't go there and NOT eat those) and one crispy beef.  The food as always was amazing. Loved the duck thu not the hoisin so took Ghazala Mijnhart advise and added some of the hot savoury sauces provided on the table. Had a lovely evening gossiping with MSK....don't get a chance for that too often there are always many people around. Ghazala tu is a treasure cove full of great idea and suggestions.\n\nAll in all a great day with many diverse aromas and flavours for THE SWOT to indulge in - in one day. \n\nCiao down amigos have a good and peaceful weekend.....for tomorrow is Nihari brunch at Log Inn lounge (Snaps Har, Abid Aziz Merchant - you guys game?)","type":"status","created_time":"2013-03-09T21:57:47+0000","updated_time":"2013-03-10T16:51:58+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"731377379","name":"Shahzad Pirwani"},{"id":"681799779","name":"Ratan Salem"},{"id":"723085405","name":"Taha Zoeb"},{"id":"641324643","name":"Nadia Moqeet"},{"id":"1579977743","name":"Amena Zoeb"},{"id":"505055634","name":"Umme Ifrah Arif"},{"id":"523286481","name":"Adnan J.
