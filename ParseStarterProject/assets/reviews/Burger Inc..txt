The idea was to find a winner amongst these 3, and then further extend the competition.\n\nBefore leaving home (G.Jauhar) I ordered MYOB and asked for their Mushroom Madness, which I was to pick from Boat Basin, since that is their only take-away spot. I reached the decided spot about 10 minutes before the MYOB-rider was to show up. He reached the place on time, and to do justice, I had decided earlier to eat the burger the instant I receive it, just to remove any ambiguities of it getting cold/stale etc. Mushroom Madness was a decent enough burger. I had major issues with it's bun, which made it's duty to annoy me till the very end. The bun kept on breaking and crumbling, and the sauces made it extremely soggy; more like a wet-dipped bread. The burger itself was nice enough, in terms of taste.\n\nNext up was The Burger Factory. My intentions were to try the mushroom-topped burgers of the 3 joints, but knowing that TBF doesn't have one, I opted for Ironman Double. It was again a nice burger, eaten as soon as it was served. The amount of cheese did justice to it's description, and the patty was comparatively MUCH softer than the MYOB patty. The MYOB patty was a bit firm. So till now, MYOB vs. TBF and TBF won.\n\nAnd finally, the last stop (after having a Hazelnut Cappuccino from Espresso) was The Burger Shack. Ordered the Shack Shroom Double, and yes there was a small queue (TBF was deserted). Received the order in 17 minutes or so. Closed my eyes, dug in for the first bite.\n*swoosh*\nI was in an entirely different landscape. With soft buns floating around me, the right amount of mushroom topping, not making the bun go soggy and a pain to deal with. And then my palates detected the first hint of the TBS-beef. Sold. Absolutely sold all over again. I was a TBS-loyal ever since I first had it, but when going out on today's expedition, my aim was to give every place a fair chance, and not be biased. I opened my eyes and the reason for the queue outside TBS everytime I went there was answered by the bite of Shack Shroom in my mouth.\n\nMYOB vs. TBF vs. TBS\nHands down, of these three, The Burger Shack is the winner.\nMy next venture would be to compare The Burger Shack and Burger Inc.\n\nEat on people!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-12-17T19:01:13+0000","updated_time":"2013-12-20T07:18:57+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"549030715","name":"Rawfay Ahmed"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"688469251","name":"Azeem Dada"},{"id":"751128592","name":"Talha Rashid"},{"id":"716686563","name":"Maaz Sarfaraz"},{"id":"1072105633","name":"Fatima Zaidi"},{"id":"635810442","name":"Kiran Afzal"},{"id":"514392526","name":"Mahnaz Fahad"},{"id":"827180267","name":"DrJoyo Tabsheer"},{"id":"751030900","name":"Zoha Manzar"},{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"100001640822737","name":"Khadija Jatoi"},{"id":"100003247463950","name":"Murk Mustafa"},{"id":"100000003997863","name":"Adnan Jawed Amin"},{"id":"517317558","name":"Muhammad Jawad"},{"id":"652785155","name":"Marium Asim"},{"id":"640740531","name":"Reshma Chhotani"},{"id":"804995006","name":"Muhammad Naseer"},{"id":"1580010637","name":"Ayesha Ahsan"},{"id":"882650316","name":"Sabah Shaikh"},{"id":"528034021","name":"Sikander Majeed"},{"id":"576731107","name":"Shahzad Nayani"},{"id":"1373776544","name":"Samia Waheed"},{"id":"667017252","name":"Taha Javed"},{"id":"727791205","name":"Amber Dada"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzI3NzkxMjA1","before":"NTQ5MDMwNzE1"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_668159803235173/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzI3NzkxMjA1"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"668223359895484","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Excellent read and great review!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-17T21:48:13+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"668223683228785","from":{"name":"Rabeet Rao","id":"749204552"},"message":"Much obliged ma'am. :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-17T21:48:52+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"668225179895302","from":{"name":"Nabeel Kazi","id":"733018407"},"message":"That is pretty hardcore of you Rabeet.

A few lapses to be noted while giving the order. Had to repeat my order 3 times before the guy completely understood what I wanted. Secondly, no plastic money accepted, as of yet. So that was a little bummer.\nReceived my order in under 15-18 minutes. Good enough.\nWhen receiving the order, I asked whether or not there is the additional Tribeca Sauce topping that I asked (and paid) for. Apparently, they forgot that. No problem. Happens. But instead of adding that to the burger, they gave it to me as a dip.\nNow as for the burgers, yes the Tribeca Twins tasted good. But that's it. The burger tasted just....\"good\". Yes it is the only place as of yet the patty of which reminds you of Mr. Burger (which I think has THE most unique beef patty). The burger was good. Some would definitely call it brilliant. They have every right to call it so. But to me personally, it was just....lacking that \"kick\" which could make it an \"outstanding\" burger.\nAs for the Fried Chicken Fillet Burger, it was yet another experience. Hands down, THE most well-cooked piece of chicken I've had in my burger in ages. The time for which it was kept in the fryer, brilliant. Juicy, soft, moist; I can go on and on as to the quality of the chicken and the way it was cooked.\nThe fries though, for Rs. 100 were yet again just....\"okay\". Nothing exceptional about them as well.\n\nSo, would I visiting Burger Inc. again? Definitely. As I said, it's not at all bad. It's good. It's nice.\nWould I be expecting Burger Inc. to surprise me with its flavor? Sadly, no.\nBut that's just about me and my own taste buds.\n\nOnto the next experience, which was yesterday, at Del Frio. I've read posts of many different members having rough days at Del Frio, ranging from rude staff to over-cooked/burnt pizza base, but in all honesty, yesterday was my 7th or 8th visit at their SMCHS outlet and I am yet to experience a bad day with them. I've been visiting Del Frio at that outlet from the time they didn't even have the credit/debit-card machines (starting days) and my orders have ranged from pizzas to sandwiches, coffees to slushes (which they call \"XYZ ice\", depending on the flavors) and everything everytime has not just been consistent but remarkably tasty as well. Yesterday, the outlet was fairly full and I ordered my usual there, which was the Hot n Spicy pizza and the Hazelnut Cappuccino. The pizza was yum. As always. The cappuccino, though not the best I've had in K-Town (I enjoy Bella Vita's and ESPRESSO's Hazelnut Cappuccino THE most, and noone else comes close), but was just the way it always serves.\nI agree many of you have had bad times at Del Frio, but I really haven't had any such experience from them as of yet.\n\nEat on people!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-06T01:32:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-06T01:32:39+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001249191882","name":"Fozia Amjad"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"514392526","name":"Mahnaz Fahad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE0MzkyNTI2","before":"MTAwMDAxMjQ5MTkxODgy"}}},"restaurantName":"Burger Inc."},{"id":"165861103465048_644369782280842","from":{"name":"Madiha Jaffri","id":"514693428"},"message":"HOW IS Burger Inc. ??","type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-03T12:21:42+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-03T14:44:22+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"517920558","name":"Imran Khan"},{"id":"575220192","name":"Asad Ahmed Leghari"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTc1MjIwMTky","before":"NTE3OTIwNTU4"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"644372258947261","from":{"name":"Umair Tahir","id":"591470264"},"message":"Burger is gud.

Once we reached the window we were informed that orders would be taken after 5 minutes, as the servers would be heading to the nearby mosque to pray asar. Another man was waiting for 2 milkshakes the servers left out of his order, and he waited a very long time. We waited 10 minutes while the servers completed 2 more orders and another patron arrived and was dealt with rather rudely. He tried to place his order and was told the same, that they had to go to namaz and that jamaat would be over in 5 minutes. To this, the patron replied, ?how long will my order take to be ready once I have placed it?? and the server had him repeat the question and then said very rudely, ?yaar yeh banda tou paanch minute yahin zaya karwa dega? and repeated that orders would be taken after namaz and shut the window.

I very much remember the delay in your order and truly regret the delay. Please give us some time to sort out our kitchen logistics and order times.

Burger Inc. is not about running a chop shop and churning out burgers fast, it is about serving burger that our customers would truly appreciate. From the beef, to the cheese to the buns and veggies, we are hell bent on not compromising, and this is a big reason, along with a few others, why we are experiencing delays. We want you get a good product in return for your hard earned money, and as I see it the one thing we honestly need to improve is service times. I am NOT from the restaurant industry, I have no fancy chefs on board, yet by the grace of Allah we have been able to put forth a quality product, and I can only say that our service will soon also meet the same quality standards our food currently does.
