This is definitely something the management at BBQ Tonight can fix..\n\nComing to the main attraction food.. There was a good variety of almost every item one can think of in Karachi.. Omelettes, Pan Cakes with Maple, Chocolate, Strawberry Syrups and Honey, French Toast, Sarson ka Saag Makayi ki Roti, Sausages, Fried Fish, Halva Puri Tarkari and Chanay, Nihari, Fresh Fruits, Cereals, Variety of different bakery items like cake rusk and croissants, Salads, Lassi(Sweet and Salty Both), Coffee and Tea.. Milk(Hot and Cold), Fresh Dahee.. You name what you have tried for breakfast in Pakistan they had almost everything there.. \n\nWe had mixed reviews for almost everything.. Overall great value for money and everyone had something to eat.. Perfect place to take your family and no one would complain..\n\nPancakes and French Toast need to be improved ALOT.. I can make better than what they had.. \n\nI would rate the overall experience 7/10..","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-30T18:01:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-30T20:05:59+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"651772299","name":"Asif Waqar"},{"id":"100002204175557","name":"Syed Khizer Zaidi"},{"id":"100006703986647","name":"Ghufran Haroon"},{"id":"100001388892633","name":"Zahra Mirza"},{"id":"1519835339","name":"Fiza Shabir"},{"id":"506626103","name":"Rameez Adam"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwMzQ5ODA0NzU0","before":"NjUxNzcyMjk5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"626664010718086","from":{"name":"Ateeb Akber","id":"649725153"},"message":"sounds cool.. per head rate?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T18:37:22+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626682507382903","from":{"name":"Madiha Hassan","id":"875400299"},"message":"How much was it per head?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T19:10:59+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626685387382615","from":{"name":"Syed Talha Izhar","id":"713665522"},"message":"it was 700 something.. for 6 people we paid around 4600..","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-30T19:19:36+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"626698424047978","from":{"name":"Bushra Nauman","id":"531528379"},"message":"It's the worst breakfast in town!

Usually avoid going to the fancy restaurants offering desi cuisine because let's face it, we all love the roadside food regardless of its hygienic value. Anyhow, this place has really come out as a surprise ! Our order included the following:\n- Nihari\n- Biryani\n- Haleem\nThe Nihari is an absolute treat for the taste buds considering I personally am not a huge fam of Nihari. Desi makes its Nihari in Yakhni and it is the sort that you don't barf all day after having some. The quantity was good enough for 5 of us. It's slightly less thicker than we usually have everywhere else. The one DESI offers is light and tastes exceptionally good as compared to other Nihari walas around. Highly recommended !\n\nDesi's Biryani is something that I have not skipped in the last two visits to this place. Those who have tried it know it very well so won't go into the details. Great quantity and taste. Easily the best offered among other competing restaurants.\n\nThe Haleem *sigh*.

Originally my family and I wanted to go and have sehri at bbq tonight but there was a 20-30 minute waiting and since it was already like 3 in the am we decided against it. Ended up going to boat basin and the family members wanted to have handi/saalan type food we ended up going to Nihari Inn. I, personally was not fond of this place as is because I had gotten food poisoning the first time I ate here which was around 6 years ago. But the second experience was the cherry on top. Ordered the boneless chicken handi which tasted like chicken karahi..when we asked the waiter he said it was chicken karahi cooked in a handi.. Then we asked the manager and HE said it was infact chicken handi cooked in a karahi! Wth? Ordered the dhaaga wala kabab.. Which i didnt have because I dont like it. But according to my family it was good. Ordered plain nan and when I asked for garlic naan the manager was like we dont have that here.. Dude how hard is it to make garlic naan?? And I ordered the boneless chicken boti. The boti was ok but too spicy and there was no salad with it. The dhaga wala kabab didnt have salad either..upon enquiry we were told that the salad was infact the bowl of onions on our table and that too for both of our dishes COMBINED. When the waiter asked for drinks I ordered pepsi and he told us sorry sir pepsi thandi nahi hai but I let that go and ordered a mountain dew. Aaaaaand that wasnt cold either -_- Never going back there again! I prefer Chick n Chips over this place anytime of the day now!","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-07T23:51:35+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-08T21:04:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"509209694","name":"Sheheryar Khan"},{"id":"100000383834376","name":"Hamza S.

But, this time I went with my mother. Now, I've tried their Chapli Kebabs, Nihari and all the Heaven/ Hell burgers, which is the good stuff, so I wanted something different. Anyway, here's my review:\n\nMind you, I've had amazing experiences before of this place. Nobody came to take the order, so I had to make a shout to the waiter to do so. -__- Then, as we were sitting, I just took the lid off the sugar pot, and out poured a gazillion ants. I didn't create a fuss or anything, and since I didn't take my phone, there are no pictures. However, the guy took the pot away and cleaned it up. \n\nMom ordered Fish and Chips, and I, bereft of choice, went for the Rooster Steak, which I was informed was the larger version of the Chic Steak. Didn't get the espresso shots. We also ordered fries. The first set of fries came earlier than the meal, and they were fine. Mom really liked her fish and chips too. But, the steak was a real disappointment. Being a steak lover, I was hoping for the same level or at least close to what we get at Roasters or Flo. Sadly, for the upsized version which was served on a humongous platter, I got two very thinly cut strips of chicken, with a dip that was just way too much compared to the 'steak'. The price? Same as what you'd pay at Roasters for a good steak (Wild Mushroom/ Monterrey Chicken). I fail to visualize the size of the smaller one. Then, midway through the meal, I ordered more fries, which came very late. We had long finished the meal, and since there wasn't a sign of the fries, I called the guy. He said 'fries mei hi subse ziada dair lagti hai', which was really confusing. Anyway, they arrived twenty minutes after the meal had finished and nobody was in the mood to eat by then. \n\nSo, in a gist, the fries were great, the fish and chips were great, but steaks aren't their strongest suit. Serving times were tremendously slow this night. And, nobody likes being greeted by ants the minute you sit down on a table. And, that's all. I hope Quddusi Sahab takes notice and they improve their standards, without letting complacency become a factor. Cheers, y'all.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-07-10T18:42:54+0000","updated_time":"2013-07-10T19:17:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"671250001","name":"Noman Iqbal"},{"id":"100000420764459","name":"Sana Shakir"},{"id":"604074782","name":"Farheen Jeelani"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA0MDc0Nzgy","before":"NjcxMjUwMDAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"583393721711782","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"noted with concern, both issues will be sorted out tomorrow, really sorry to read, i was around but pre occupied for tomorrow, will get back to you, plz apologies to yr mother from my side","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-10T19:14:46+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"583394268378394","from":{"name":"Najm Ahmed","id":"885480695"},"message":"Yes, I saw you behind the counter.

Everything was uber delicious esp the chowmein, prawnballs and beef chillie dry. Prawn balls were lovely golden, crispy from the outside, soft with prawn chunks inside. Not doughy/chewy, instead melted in the mouth. Beef was perfectly stir fried, succulent and v tender. Order time was apparently 1.5 hrs but was delivered in 50 mins. The best part is its relatively more reasonable and good value for home delivered chinese. Was delivered piping hot.

Noodles were finished last eve and so were the accompanying raw veggies, paapri and the addictive laal chutney.  The curry was good enuff for 6-7 servings so this eve made my own version of SF's leftover Khowsuey.  Boiled a pack of noodles, poured the curry on top of it, added some freshly cut coriander and spring onions.  With no leftover paapri, added some Chill Flavored Kurkure, Tom Yum Kung Flavored Peanuts and Special Chaat Masala that I got from Silver Spoon on my last visit there (yes this is the masala that Silver Spoon sprinkles on their Meethi Puri).  So a whole new flavored Khowsuey this eve that didn't taste like the leftovers from yesterday.  SF you should either increase the quantity of noodles or reduce the quantity of curry by half.

Never again!! Admittedly, it was a lot of food for Rs 2000.. One huge pizza (20\" ??) 6 chicken wings, pepperoni sticks, 1.5 litre coke and 10 sauces (we got only 6 though). We order the pizza half-and-half: Godspell Beef Load (salami, pepperoni, seasoned ground beef, mushrooms, black olives, green peppers and roasted onions) and Wicked Blend (Chicken Tikka, Chicken Fajita, Smoky Chicken, Roasted onions and flooring of Green peppers, mushrooms and olives). The pizza was so oily that I wish I had eaten Nihari instead! There was something off about the meat toppings.. the salami was absolutely unchewable, the chicken toppings all seemed to be of one type only unlike the description. The cheese was lacking in taste and in quality. Marinara sauce was almost non-existent, and was also one of the sauces missing from our deal. The pepperoni sticks were a square pizza slice cut into strips with pieces of pepperoni strewn here and there on the cheese topped crust. The only saving grace were the wings which tasted great but were literally minuscule. Given the kind of advertising they are doing, I was expecting to be blown away! But sadly, it turned out to be my worst pizza experience to date!

Came back at about 11:30 starving. Had a normal unda toast naashta and 4 bites of the refrigerated leftover burger from BURGER INC. have to say noot baad..seriously next time I am ordering two so I have a cold for naashta. \n\nThen the hard hard work at the clinic.....desperately needed good coffee and had a meeting so went off too LAL's \n\nMadiha Sultan Tai.....really good mug of large vanilla latte. Good beans. Tried 4 different macaroons.....pistachio, chocolate, lemon, strawberry....the experience was very nice. The macaroons themselves were perfect found the filling in each a little insipid, met MST and she said that it was no issue next time that will be corrected. First time into LAL's it's so pretty and I love some of their pastries I have already had those and didn't want to add to the calories......also had a little something waiting at home.....\n\nCame home to find that an order of brownies were waiting from Taha Zoeb....and OH MY GOD.....Perfect ones..... Haider Zaidi you need to try these to understand what I was saying and why I suggested a few tweaks. Will bring some over tomorrow Haroon Leghari.\n\nHad promised that I will Eat for a Cause.... So called GinSoy for a reservation for 2..... They were booked so called up China Kitchen instead and at 8:30 met Mahvash Siddiqi Khan there. Since just two offs and we are both adventurous we thought hmmmm lets have the duck. So with that one beef ribs ( yes I can't go there and NOT eat those) and one crispy beef.  The food as always was amazing. Loved the duck thu not the hoisin so took Ghazala Mijnhart advise and added some of the hot savoury sauces provided on the table.

New establishment, ground + 1st floor, modern interior, Excellent service, very friendly and helpful staff. Only Pista macaroons, so skipped them, indulged in the Vanilla Gelato - By far, the best in the city by a mile 9/10. Also took home the Choc Tart, 6/10, Choc Eclair 8.0/10, Choc Chip Cookie 7.5/10, Choc brownie 7.5/10. Overall, a fantastic addition to the eateries in the defence area. Reasonable prices for the quality of the end product it produces. Been told that B'fast will be starting in a few weeks. Watch out Butlers and Espresso, I think this one might top the Shahbaz Comm scene.

I?ve been crazy busy with work the entire week.\n\nSo here is my list of top 10 eateries in Karachi :)\n\n1. The Upper Crust. Don?t think I need to go into the details here. Everything is sheer perfection. \n\n2. Koel Caf? ? When in doubt, just land your tushie at Koel and you will always enjoy phenomenal food, lovely ambience and very courteous service \u003c3\n\n3. BOTS ? again, no need to go into details, for obvious reasons, lol! Delicious food, great delivery service and an absolutely delightful host.\n\n4. Log Inn Lounge ? serves one of the best burgers in town, service is fabulous and the host is a wonderful person. Which is an added bonus for the place that is already doing so well on its food :)\n\nThese are my top 4. Rest of the 6 are fabulous places but I?m only going to list them as I don?t really want to rate them on the top 10 in any particular order. They are all wonderful places that serve great food with impeccable service.\n\n? Olivetto ? love the ambience, love the food even more.\n\n? Grilled Chilliz ? delicious food and great value for money.\n\n? Snack Attack ? a gem not known to many people on this group, in bahadurabad area. They make the best mushroom burgers in town! \n\n? Pizzo ? reviving the concept of great pizzas delivered at home.

Ambiance, I don't really care much for. \n\n1) BOTS: With over 200 dishes. It caters to my Chinese, Seafood, Bbq fixes all under ONE roof, What more can one ask for? \n2) GHAFFAR KABAB HOUSE: One place a food lover can never leave dissapointed. \n3) HARDEES: If I could eat one thing all day everyday. It would be a GREAT beef n cheese burger. And for me the Hardees Superstar is the best Beef Cheese karachi has to offer. As good as it is, the other burgers are equally as bad. \n4) XANDERS: Fried Calamari, Clasic Beef Cheese Burger & New York Cheese Cake 'nuff said. \n5) JAVED NIHARI: Regular Swotties know me for being a desi food fanatic. And it doesn't get any desier than Javed Nihari. Best Nihari in Karachi.  \n6) AGHA SAJJI HOUSE : This is just for my katakat fix. Beats all katakat places I've ever had. And I've had katakat at more than a dozen places atleast. \n7) DONISL : My second favorite Kakakat joint, used to be my first. Quality has gone down. \n8) CAFE BLUE GINGER: Beef In Oyster Sauce. FTW!!\n9) MADNI BIRYANI: My favorite biryani. Sometimes consistency issues, but still the best biryani which has top quality chawal unlike others. \n10) KUNDAN BROAST: With a different broast waala on every street corner, standing out takes hard work. And stand out, Kundan does. \n\nNotable Mentions : \nTUC : RVC\nCakery: Cheesecakes, Cheesecakes and Cheesecakes\nChips: Beef Cheese. \nKarachi Broast: Love their Dry shashlik with the special hot sauce.\nBADAL PAN SHOP: For a must Raja Sahab after dining out experience.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-30T05:43:03+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-30T10:59:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"1198831376","name":"Ammar N Farwah Abidi"},{"id":"647765253","name":"Soobika Alvi"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"581895987","name":"Emane Haque"},{"id":"650845003","name":"Shafia Agha"},{"id":"531710313","name":"Aly Raza"},{"id":"619235873","name":"Nezihe Hussain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE5MjM1ODcz","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"388889521162204","from":{"name":"Sajjad Naqvi","id":"100000370466528"},"message":"Badal Pan Shop? the one on five star chowrangi? behind babulilm?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-30T06:41:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"388891964495293","from":{"name":"Danial Rizvi","id":"726690443"},"message":"Yeah","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-05-30T06:46:46+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"388921331159023","from":{"name":"Ammara Haque","id":"501356389"},"message":"sdcr: ghaffar is my all time favour and so is agha sajji house.

I havent had nihari at Javed's so I cannot comment on that. \n\nWhile we are on the topic, do try the fried kababs and the qorma at Cafe Hassan with tandoor fresh be-chheetay-ki-sheermal (sheermal that hasnt been sprayed with water after baking). They are awesome. \n\nFinally, the directions to Cafe Hassan are quite simple.If you are going from Clifton or M.A.Jinnah Road, go past Civil Hospital, and turn left towards Lady Dufferin Hospital. Continue  straight past Lady Dufferin and past the Lighthouse flea market crossing, and about 500  yards down the road, you will see Cafe Hassan on your right.

China Kitchen.............. Here is the low down. I took the set menu (thank god for simplicity) Started with Hot and Sour soup, Wonderful smoky taste, adorned with Tofu, ginger and Shitake mushrooms. Brilliant, as good as any soup in a decent New York restaurant. Then came the wontons, crisp with a plum sauce.The most amazing dish was the fried squid, covered with sechuan pepper, tiny diced chillies was pure heaven. Moist, flavourful, balanced with shrimp. Awesome. Then the crispy beef in a noodle nest. Once again the tang of orange peel, the sweetness the crisp crunch. Then came the mind blowers. The black pepper beef, was moist tender chunks of beef, delicate, juicy and tender, like top sirloin. Spotted Ayaz of Okra  dining next to us. The tender chunks of chicken in a tangy sesame sauce.  The Sechuan fish was awesome. I do not praise restaurants much, usually I am underwhelmed. BUT.... China Kitchen has done something that few will appreciate, they have REDEFINED the ketchupy food we have come to expect from Chinese restaurants. The food, the service was Awesome....

China Kitchen.............. Here is the low down. I took the set menu (thank god for simplicity) Started with Hot and Sour soup, Wonderful smoky taste, adorned with Tofu, ginger and Shitake mushrooms. Brilliant, as good as any soup in a decent New York restaurant. Then came the wontons, crisp with a plum sauce.The most amazing dish was the fried squid, covered with sechuan pepper, tiny diced chillies was pure heaven. Moist, flavourful, balanced with shrimp. Awesome. Then the crispy beef in a noodle nest. Once again the tang of orange peel, the sweetness the crisp crunch. Then came the mind blowers. The black pepper beef, was moist tender chunks of beef, delicate, juicy and tender, like top sirloin. Spotted Ayaz of Okra  dining next to us. The tender chunks of chicken in a tangy sesame sauce.  The Sechuan fish was awesome. I do not praise restaurants much, usually I am underwhelmed. BUT.... China Kitchen has done something that few will appreciate, they have REDEFINED the ketchupy food we have come to expect from Chinese restaurants. The food, the service was Awesome.... I hereby award my RED HAT for the best upcoming ground breaking Chinese Restaraunt. The food was divine, except the fried rice.

Now I'll come down to the con's , I was thoroughly disappointed in fact even embarrassed when the waiter at the cafe said that they were outta Froyo (both flavours) and all he could get me was one large cup of chocolate Froyo (We were 5 people we ended up sharing it yes thats pretty sad in itself ) , the part that was disappointing was that it was just 10 pm on a weekend night in Karachi people usually go out to a cafe at that time for dessert and when you end up coming out empty handed its the worst feeling ever. Secondly the flavours for the Froyo were pretty limited Chocolate and Mixed Fruit respectively I think there should be more flavours. We thought of opting for some other desserts then but when we went to check out the dessert window there wasn't much to choose from. I didn't see any of the delicious looking cakes or cupcakes that are posted on the official Upper Crust page anywhere in the cafe. We ended up going to the Hotspot instead and were thoroughly satisfied like always . I am definitely willing to give the place another shot since its a relatively new place and with a really enthusiastic owner it definitely does have potential to improve.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-04T19:33:23+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-07T12:33:46+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002605916001","name":"Sadaf Munir"},{"id":"603490700","name":"Mariam Bilgrami"},{"id":"677295563","name":"Natasha Khalid"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njc3Mjk1NTYz","before":"MTAwMDAyNjA1OTE2MDAx"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"271636166220874","from":{"name":"Maleeha Jawaid","id":"785615314"},"message":"Bilal you're baackkk","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-04T19:43:05+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"271641302887027","from":{"name":"Bilal Hassan","id":"512386146"},"message":"Yayyy I be back yo","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2011-12-04T19:45:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"271653646219126","from":{"name":"De Joe","id":"597535350"},"message":"This was our 15th day, in business.
