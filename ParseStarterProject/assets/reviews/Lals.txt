The oldest and most famous was United Bakery,Periera bakery(famous for its coconut macroons) the Fresco bakery (President's in laws) Flurries and Blue Ribbon Bakery. Today we have several new players in the run starting with the run in the mill day to day bakeries examples are Mahmood sweets, Sony sweets and bakers,Ideal bakers top notch or high end we have Hob Nob, Pie in the Sky, Bravo, Neenis, Red Riding Hood, Torte Pasticceria,Lals Patisserie, La Farine,Espresso Gloria Jeans, then their is Cakery which was originally a home based bakery which progressed and today has its own outlet and a whole army of home based bakers, enterprising young and mature ladies who made their mark in the field of baking. Now the crux of this discussion is how much in your opinion should a cake cost?? How much are consumers willing to pay for a premium cake? Current per pound rates range from btwn Rs. 500-650-750- to 1000. Cakes have to be ordered in advance and cash advance has to be paid, a few years ago a friend running a bakery stated it cost 50% less but now the cost of the main ingredients milk, eggs, butter, icing, packaging and all other related costs have increased in a big way, but so has competition, as this page has several well know home based bakers and they will testify to the fact that due to cut throat competition they have to slash their profits while they work over time and hire extra labor to meet their clients orders on time. So now we should be able to do justice and decide as to what should a reasonable 5Ib cake cost? 500 per Ib or 750Ib? One new entrant on Zamzama shocked quite a few, they quoted 3000 ++ for a 4Ib cake, wow, that's like secret recipe which charged astronomical prices but crashed and burned in no time when they quoted these bombastic prices, so are we going to see more CAKE WARS in the the coming days with more new players emerging? Home based bakers dominating the scene or commercial entities, let's get some interactive and truthful comments.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-26T20:44:37+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-28T15:16:42+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"505055634","name":"Umme Ifrah Arif"},{"id":"1316130943","name":"Madiha Gillani"},{"id":"100003756103781","name":"Asif Jamil Ansari"},{"id":"1291009466","name":"Shahzar Pervaiz"},{"id":"515063254","name":"Kashish Ahmed"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"690822119","name":"Saniya Abdul Qadir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjkwODIyMTE5","before":"NTA1MDU1NjM0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"624856717565482","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"3000 for a 4lbs is not shocking.

Two days later Madiha, the owner of Lals called me and very nicely asked me what my concerns of the desserts were, I really appreciate that she took out time to call me and listen to what I had to say- it shows that she is open to criticism, and that if a customer writes in a comment card it will not go unnoticed. So back to the food, she told me to go visit Lals a re-taste the cr?me brulee as the problem had been rectified, she was right! The cr?me brulee was light and perfectly crafted; every bite was heavenly and easily melted in my mouth. The only feedback I would give is that; Vanilla bean is always a good ingredient to add in a cr?me brulee also it is important to look into creating a separate chocolate cr?me brulee as Lals specialty is chocolate after all.

We also have to see how difficult it is to make and the time it takes. Macarons are made by Lal Majid her self and not the bakers so that factors in. On top of that all of our fillings are ganache (not butter cream) made from real chocolate of course so the costs add up. Our margins on macarons are tiny and the price has remained Rs 75 since we started selling them 3 years ago. As you know globally they cost upwards of Rs 200.

If you go to Laduree and look carefully you will notice even there some are cracked, some are higher and some not. Unless ofcourse they are factory made and frozen in which case they taste shit. Now that said no one should pay money for something they don't want to eat, and for that reason our policy on macarons is if you don't think they are okay we'll replace them for you with  fresh ones provided you bring them back within 24 hours. Lals has been making macarons for a few years now and successfully caters to large events and giveaways etc, we have numerous happy customers as well, and I would love for you two to become part of that group so do come back.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-07T09:29:51+0000","like_count":8,"user_likes":false},{"id":"515339071850581","from":{"name":"Sara Khan","id":"527720164"},"message":"I've had Lals macarons umpteen times and thy have been fabulous each time!!just as good as the ones iv had in dubai.crumbly n melt in ur mouth delights","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-03-07T17:42:09+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"515359171848571","from":{"name":"Saad Ahmed","id":"602358073"},"message":"Danyal: i have heard a lot about laduree myself.

I'd say that has much to do with the way the planned proceedings were kept secret. I mean, despite thorough investigation, I was not sure what exactly was going to happen there, and if it was going to be a big bash kind of a thing or just a peaceful presentation, or perhaps a game show (yes that thought also crossed my mind! :P) Anyways, would love to hear more about the event from whoever else went. On another note, the pleasurehunt internet game is awesome!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-02T20:35:05+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"391157840935372","from":{"name":"Sairah Khalid","id":"544715226"},"message":"Najam sahab, i am usually punctual at such events and openings and am always waiting for the staff and organisers to prepare the venue for the opening. it is extremely frustrating and i feel EMBARRASSED for THEM!!\ni was told earlier this afternoon that even though the invite reads \"5:00\" p.m., proceedings have been planned for 5:30/5:45 p.m.! due to other commitments, i was delayed and so reached at 6:30 p.m. when i was told i had just missed the presentation, which meant the event did not start post 6:00 p.m.!!\nas everyone was so involved in getting their photographs taken in costumes, i sampled the \"belgian\" chocolate that was the highlight of the function. it tasted the same as walls' magnums usually do!\ni was told that unilever plans to open a self-serve magnum cafe!\nWHOOPPIEEE DO!\n\ni just wish everyone would stop getting on the same bandwagon and do something different!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-02T21:24:11+0000","like_count":5,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam","type":"user","offset":0,"length":5}]},{"id":"391325837585239","from":{"name":"Farah S.

But got a call around 5:40 on my way back from work to please come, just in time to divert the car. Got to see the presentations, followed by the spheal of that lovely Chocolatier, the owner of Lals focused on Belgian Chocolate. I enjoyed the making\" your own dipping? part of tasting, which sure tasted better then the any existing choc-bars of Walls. Not sure about it being Belgian, but tasted good. Let us see how it makes the business, the ice-cream at Rs.85/\u003d which does taste good but not much different, but is a good one dipped in crunch, and candies bits and several layers of melted chocolate that freezes beautifully sealing inside the crispy crunch and chocolate chip oooooh what luxury. They said a cafe will soon come up with this feature, I will probably wait for that.\n\nHave been tweating images and updates from the launch!!!
