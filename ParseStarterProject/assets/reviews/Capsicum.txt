While there was still 5 minutes for our turn, I went up to the manager and told him, please hold onto my reservation, I shall be back from the cabin outside. I was back instantly and it was 11:00, I was told by the manager, that sorry you have missed your turn and would now have to wait for another 15 minutes. (and have no policy of holding a reservation, which they did not mention earlier). I waited another 15 and was given a table. I asked for the order to be taken but it seemed as if the place was understaffed. After 10 minutes my seating was shifted upstairs (as I requested there was no cooling at the spot I had gotten). I literally had to ask 3 - 4 times, for my order to be taken. A waiter came to us and noted our orders at sharp 11:30 pm. We were told that the order would take atleast 30-35 minutes to be served. I was not okay with the further waiting though, but I observed a family seated next to me, were so pissed off and complaining that their food had not been served since over 45 minutes. I decided to walk out, I came downstairs, asked the manager to cancel our orders. She literally started to beg, (this is not our policy to let go our customers in angry mood) She politely brought us up, and we were seated again. She called in for the waiter, who said, he has not proceeded with the order (next thing we witnessed there was a mob-fight-between-staff/waiters-entering in the kitchen. A very disturbing view, which made me no other choice to leave, again. We drove to Nandos Pakistan SMCHS who made our lives much easier and delivered their best, not commenting on their recent quality though.\n\nSecond episode at Capsicum. Last night we walked in and got a table for 3. We ordered food for 2 and our 3rd friend, only ordered dessert. We specified that all the items should be served together. (service went wrong). The dessert was an over cooked brownie with no or almost melted icecream, and they perhaps forgot to serve the tea, which they did, while we ordered the bill. Poor service from the waiters. But food was good.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-05T06:16:10+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-05T08:32:17+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"628851490499338","from":{"name":"Zara Saleem","id":"727715359"},"message":"Baneen Got your answer?
