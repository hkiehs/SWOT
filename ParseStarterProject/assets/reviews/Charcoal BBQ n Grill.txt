Went there yesterday, the overall service was okay, but the setup of serving was small according to the number of people for the iftar. Food quality was very much below average. I was literary finding something good to eat. Charcoal is a BBQ and Grill place and only 1 BBQ item was served which was reshmi kabab. I literary had to fight to cut my pepper steak, it was almost like a rubber and very poorly cooked. Prawns were served almost raw. The only eatable thing i found was chicken karhaye and Beef Chillie. The desserts were pathetic, i was expecting some good taste after looking at the desserts area. The ice-cream was like a frozen sweet milk. The chocolate cake and other chocolate items had a very bad taste. I will definitely not recommend anyone to go to Charcoal BBQ & Grill. Their a la carte is good, but at iftar buffet and dinner; they have seriously compromised the quality.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-11T00:47:15+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-11T00:47:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"668090430","name":"Qazi Umair"},{"id":"507348941","name":"Muhammad Waqas"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTA3MzQ4OTQx","before":"NjY4MDkwNDMw"}}},"restaurantName":"Charcoal BBQ n Grill"},{"id":"165861103465048_279238225460668","from":{"name":"Ezwana R-Zaman","id":"701414399"},"message":"Went to Charcoal BBQ n Grill last night. Ordered the starter of the Charcoal Platter consisting of fried chicken slices with cheese, fish fingers, chicken wings & deep fried button mushrooms served with 4 dippers. That plate was emptied within mintues by 3 adults & 3 kids - verdict - yummy n felt like ordering more!\n\nMain courses:\n\n1) Mushroom Steak with mashed potatoes - It was beef, juicy and well done, served withg fantastic taste of mashied potatoes.\n\n2) Fish & Chip - 2 slices of fish fillets served with salad and fries. Quite a serving that my mom still had 1 sliced left coz she was too full. Served with tartar sauce and a dipper for the fries which was really crispy.\n\n3) Charcoal Mix Platter - enough for 2 - Grilled prawns wz sliced capsicum, small slice of lemon and onion - a lil spicy but not desi :) Steak with sauce, again juicy n yummy. Fish fillet - crispy on the outside but soft in the inside, chicken piece with white sauce - no complain and lastly their awesome mashed potatoes!\n\n4) Popcorn Chicken with fries (kiddy meal) - Big popcorn chicken deep fried just nice, crispy and juice and yummy fries that was served with it with the dipper. Had to order another one coz the elder son didnt want to share! :)\n\nDesserts -\n\n1) Brownie - Big chunk of brownie served in a tall glass, surrounded with yummy ice cream vanilla ice cream, huge portion, can be shared.\n\n2) Chocolate Mousse - smooth and chocolatey at the right amount.\n\n3) Cheesecake with caramel - Delish and with the caramel on top it added just the right amount of sweetness to it,just perfect to end our evening by the sea.\n\nGreat service, ambiance and definitely worth a visit. Will put up some photos soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-17T04:19:31+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-17T04:51:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1098409171","name":"Frida Natasha"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"610590030","name":"Najam Malik"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjEwNTkwMDMw","before":"MTA5ODQwOTE3MQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"279249205459570","from":{"name":"Mohsin E Azam","id":"622525326"},"message":"I second that...
