Early dinner at SattarBuksh with friends, and we were able to find space easily at 1930hrs.  Wanted to sit outside, but apparently, one requires to order Sheesha for that -- and none of us fancied smoking water.\n\nThe place suffers from an identity crisis, as it tries to make the traditional 'dhaba' feel more upscale.  The names of various items on the menu are well thought-out -- but it is really annoying to read Urdu in Roman Script.  Developing a menu purely in Urdu would have been an excellent initiative -- but I doubt majority of the patrons of the place would be comfortable with it.  The playlist of the place, was as confusing as the place itself.\n\nOrdered the 'Besharam Bun Kebab', and it was besharam, beghairat, and behooda at the same time.  It was completely bland, and as a friend remarked, \"it can serve as the perfect meal for someone who has just had Endoscopy, and needs to avoid food with spices, flavor, et al\".  Basically, a bun kebab for those who are unwell.  \n\nCan't really figure how difficult it is for SattarBuksh to prepare a decent bun kebab -- just hire the guy who stands opposite Uzma Arcade, and sell the PKR50 Anda Shami for PKR500.  Seriously, if people are willing to pay a top buck for the hospital burger -- they will be delighted to get some flavor with it as well.\n\nThe Roast Beef Burger was pretty much a disaster as well.  The meat was done well, but it was too damn salty.  All one could taste in the burger was salt, and nothing else.  Again -- these guys need to hire the guy who cooks the stuff at CHIPS and sells it for half the price.  If you're charging a top buck for a basic item, at least get the flavor right!\n\nThe Panini Sandwich was as dry as dust.  Nothing special about it.  Just a panini, and some dry chicken.  One can make a better Panini Sandwich at home at one-tenth the cost.  Again -- it had absolutely no flavor, only some chunks of chicken.\n\nI ordered an Iced Mocha, and that was the saving grace -- and it tasted perfect in that cheap IKEA glass.  The Apple Cinnamon tea also had a really nice fragrance, and was much better than other teas served in the city.  The mooch -- well, not really interested in a Movember moment.\n\nThe only good thing about the place is that it served Ben & Jerry's Strawberry Cheesecake Ice cream, which tastes awesome regardless of geographic location.\n\nA fancy place with an identity crisis, serving food straight from a hospital cafeteria.\n\nOverall Rating -- 5/10.\n\nP.S. Will go again, only for the Iced Mocha.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-10-03T20:59:31+0000","updated_time":"2013-10-04T16:41:48+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"841465178","name":"Sabika Raza"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"508081630","name":"Maha Anwar"},{"id":"705533924","name":"Aamir Shroff"},{"id":"593431153","name":"Rabia Aftab"},{"id":"838812489","name":"Saad Baig"},{"id":"505581528","name":"Asad Nasim"},{"id":"559881298","name":"Nadia Mahasin"},{"id":"549655574","name":"Nazish Huda"},{"id":"100003573879421","name":"Samina Lotia"},{"id":"524535198","name":"Syed Sarmad Hasan"},{"id":"514440277","name":"M?ri?

I'm surprised you'd say that your bun kabab was tasteless, because my bun kabab was really flavourful and came with authentic bun kabab chutneys served on the side. The only minor complaints that we had were that the rice served with jheenga-lala were inadequate, and that the pizza could do a little better with a few more pepperoni slices.

However we never realized that its going be this bad! Firstly, after constant requests, the waiter did not bother bringing us a menu. The waiter ended up coming after 20 minutes to take the order, and I thought that it was now time to relax! Well I was wrong to say the least, firstly, the music that was being played, gave me a headache! Nickelback playing in full volume is not something I expected to bear when I came to have a nice dinner with a relaxing cup of coffee. After at-least 45 minutes of waiting and begging for the food to arrive, my friend decided it was time to go and ask the manager what the scene was. \n\nThe reply which we got is as follows: ?You will have to be patient, it?s a full house today, there is nothing I can do? \n\nWell the food finally came, and the guy forgot one dish! Here are my reviews to each dish:\nPizza ? Extremely bland. Not well cooked or maybe lacked the ingredients. I?m no expert cook, so I don?t know the technicalities, but all I know is that it sucked and I would never want to have it again! The frozen food which I usually end up heating in the microwave for a midnight snack is better than this!\n\nThe Besharam burger -  Maybe a bad choice on my part, I don?t like burgers with sunny side up. But even after removing the egg, it tasted ?Average? ? No taste, nothing. Burger shack is a better place to have burgers not to forget MC DONALDS!\n\nBaragosht Roast burger ? Once again, extremely disappointed. The burger was meant to be roasted. NOT TOASTED! It was a pity that it tasted so awful.\nSome rice dish (can?t recall the name) ? best of the lot. Tasted far far better than other dishes and was worth the money.\n\nSheesha ? Rs. 900+ tax. I don?t care if you fill the sheesha up with real fruits instead of flavor, it doesn?t get this expensive! And on top of that, anyone who sits outside HAS to order sheesha is their policy. But I?m not going to take credit away from you guys, the sheesha was good. But not worth the money.\n\nIn the end, I would just like to tell my fellow members here. Please think twice before you goto this caf?. Just because you think it?s a nice name and closest thing we have to starbucks. It is not an excuse to go waste Rs. 1,000 +/head on bad food. \n\nMoreover, a message to Sattarbuksh owners. \nSaying that this was a soft launch doesn?t cut it. Your service sucked and so did the food. If you cannot take so many people, then consider hiding a few chairs and tell people to stand and wait till anyone leaves so that you don?t end up serving bad food. Places like Kolachi, Aylanto etc.. have huge waitings at times and are jam packed. But they rarely ever ruin the food. \n\nOverall rating:\nFood ? 2/5\nValue for money ? 1/5\nAmbiance ? 3/5\nService ? 2/5\nThis is an experience that is not just confined to me. A lot of people who I know and saw that day on Sattar buksh have been treated in the same manner or worse.

And they did a wonderful job and creating spaces where you don?t feel like you are all eating together with every other table in the house but rather how a caf? should be something espresso caf? and others could learn from. The flooring the walls the ceilings the artwork it isn't too much in your face yet not to subtle keeping it in line with the name. \nWell since it?s a caf? let me first talk about the chai and coffee. I think the elachi chai was amazing pretty good as good as the best chai dabas around in a comfortable environment but than again I don?t think I would be used to paying for 175 + tax for a mere cup of tea I mean you may have had it in your meetings in five star hotels but going for a casual cup of tea for 175+ is a big no no for me but heck I might go maybe but not for the tea probably for the coffee maybe because I love coffee more than my chai and they seriously did have pretty good coffee just the right temperature I had managed to try both hot and cold both were up to standard of your Gloria jeans or any other international coffee shop, priced similarly but I wouldn't go there in so much rush maybe when it dies down. \n\nHowever that is where it all goes downhill I seriously question if the idea is for  caf? or a restaurant because if they plan to make their earnings based on it being a restaurant with people occasionally ordering tea and coffee it is bound to fail they should immediately hire a new chef or something because the food is ridiculous no offence intended to anyone but the food was pathetic they don?t know how to make a pizza, a Panini in SB?s definition is a big fat loaf of bread with a bit of stuffing inside ( try butlers any given day and you will know what a Panini is ) butler is a nice example here they are not too fancy about their food but what they serve is pretty good. We were six people so I will tell the other four dishes the besharam burger again a very catchy name kudos to the guy who thought of it love the idea but the execution I have had burgers with sunny side up eggs in them but the chicken its bland no not just bland its pathetic to put it in your kitchen. Now the so called Bolognese roast burger seriously I know you guys want to be desi / angrez all at once and you have even kept the menu of bun kababs but this Bolognese burger was in the angrez section why did it taste like a bun kabab ? And not the good kind  either. Stuffed chicken penne pasta, admittedly the stuffed chicken was good but the pasta are you kidding I have made better pastas in my university days without even trying too hard. Stuffed Chicken with rice was nice because of one reason only was the chicken was the same as the pasta and that was nice. The waiter forgot our jeengalala dish which we thanked god for because after such disappointments I don?t think we could have bared another one. \n\nSheesha the only reason I mention sheesha in a separate section Is because I am big fan so I know what I am talking about well the sheeshas were nice very hygienic lots of options but 900+ tax for a sheesha I mean nowhere in Karachi have I had such an expensive sheesha. This is beyond expensive it?s a sheesha for gods sake the whole cost of making one is less than 100 rupees. Heck one whole sheesha itself costs you 3000 rupees 900+ tax for a sheesha is ridiculous Arabian or pink cadilac or for ppl of mohd ali good ol fakhir. \n\nService; well given the place was jam packed you could be forgiven for delay in service but what is unforgivable that the waiters don?t have a pen or pad to remember their orders I heard a few around me complaint about their orders and one of our dishes completely went missing when the food arrived.\n\nMy parting words I like what you are trying to do is a fusion between west and east, chai and coffee, burger and bunkabab but please change your food menu keep dishes on the light side rather than dishes with rice keep decent sandwiches nice pastas . Bring your price to a reasonable range because people might come for the hype but they need something else to come back for even those who have money to burn. But you never know Road Side caf? is still in business you might too with the same menu.As only SB can put it let me give it a try \" free advice hai leny hai tou lo warna tel lo \"","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-15T14:54:49+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T11:05:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"686500226","name":"Maira Uzair"},{"id":"883305103","name":"Hamzeh N Saabhi Hamzeh"},{"id":"61407780","name":"Zahrah Sehr Vayani"},{"id":"100000674735601","name":"Muhammad Patel"},{"id":"847285573","name":"Rafia Abid"},{"id":"542900496","name":"Amal Anis Makda"},{"id":"1014345458","name":"Sadek Motiwala"},{"id":"723496929","name":"Hiba Rashid"},{"id":"630510285","name":"Azeem Afzal Motiwala"},{"id":"100003205271578","name":"Mahnoor Mukhtar"},{"id":"1292953231","name":"Aakash Kumar"},{"id":"597946799","name":"Alishba Shah"},{"id":"512868559","name":"Halima Sadia"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"1023815310","name":"Faizan Mukarram"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"701530707","name":"Zubia Ilyas"},{"id":"892195391","name":"Tehreem Fatima"},{"id":"647225359","name":"Sana Javeri"},{"id":"535320159","name":"Muhammad Saqib Khan"},{"id":"504319826","name":"Sarah Masood"},{"id":"1364547192","name":"Rabya Sultan"},{"id":"577409061","name":"Maaz Jamal"},{"id":"100003917951343","name":"Kiran Jabeen"},{"id":"672460650","name":"Yousuf Ali Sayeed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcyNDYwNjUw","before":"Njg2NTAwMjI2"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_619166518134502/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjcyNDYwNjUw"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619168601467627","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Omg...

Went to Riverwood cafe today with a gathering, the first thing that ticked me off was the rule that everyone of us had to order drinks just to sit there. But fair enough. The thing that got me fumed up was a 500 rupee surcharge on the bill, written with a pen, besides the usual 200 rupee service charge as eidhi. Are you freakin kidding me? They expect us to spend 800 rupee on an overpriced shisha, 200 rupee service charge, along with 50% of the original amount as eidhi? We refused to pay outright, the manager did make a spoiled face when we were leaving, but this is downright derogatory. They expect people who come to these cafes to pay 500 rupee by unfairly slapping this exhobarant amount on the bill, and pressuring them to pay just to save face and embarrassment. Well F this, no wonder I hate going to these cafes.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-10T18:32:50+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-11T18:45:28+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100004544739993","name":"Anum Shafi"},{"id":"520882045","name":"Ghulam Ali"},{"id":"568861941","name":"Hassan Ahmed"},{"id":"730908290","name":"Aymen Jaffry"},{"id":"702370731","name":"Danyal Murtaza"},{"id":"100001089240373","name":"Abdul Basit Sivany"},{"id":"508588993","name":"Saroasha Eng"},{"id":"100001535796394","name":"Muhammad Ali Khan"},{"id":"508081630","name":"Maha Anwar"},{"id":"510429530","name":"Mustafa Tai"},{"id":"673567501","name":"Haris Hassan"},{"id":"607378917","name":"Shah Jamal"},{"id":"850785116","name":"Iruj Khawaja"},{"id":"1784225285","name":"Syeda Batool Naqvi"},{"id":"534115724","name":"Fatima Effendi Kanwar"},{"id":"701998125","name":"Sanoober Roohi"},{"id":"841710245","name":"Fatima Imran Malik"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"1373971643","name":"Muzammil Jawaid"},{"id":"659370395","name":"M Areeb Rehman"},{"id":"100005181698422","name":"Sara Farooq"},{"id":"571807512","name":"Sumaiya Iftekhar"},{"id":"821415242","name":"Azhar Husain Zeeshan"},{"id":"626141022","name":"Ahmed Abid"},{"id":"561712779","name":"Syed Zohaib Hussain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTYxNzEyNzc5","before":"MTAwMDA0NTQ0NzM5OTkz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_601263149924839/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNTYxNzEyNzc5"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"601263723258115","from":{"name":"Syed Mohammad Salman Husain","id":"590347699"},"message":"Plus still us receiving Eidi in 100s.. :/","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T18:35:08+0000","like_count":14,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601266059924548","from":{"name":"Zain Hasan","id":"100000234977922"},"message":"this is too much lol, its not eiddi, tell them to rename it \"Bhaata\"","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T18:42:56+0000","like_count":32,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601269079924246","from":{"name":"Nisa Ali","id":"564985482"},"message":"Weird!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T18:51:37+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601270733257414","from":{"name":"Fahad Hanif","id":"625571272"},"message":"quite surprising, utter non sense ,,,","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T18:56:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601275423256945","from":{"name":"Hasnain Jafri","id":"554510485"},"message":"Isnt Sheesha banned?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T19:11:52+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601275549923599","from":{"name":"Najm Ahmed","id":"885480695"},"message":"lol its one thing politely asking for eidhi, its another to add it as a surcharge on your bill and demand it from you.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-10T19:12:30+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"601291653255322","from":{"name":"Abdul Hafeez","id":"773317577"},"message":"Just read on another page regarding minimum order placement limit, now this nonsense!
