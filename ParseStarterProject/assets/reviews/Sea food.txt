Except for the Manchurian Of which the chicken was a bit hard all was great. From beef section we took beef chilli which was absolutely delicious and Sichuan fish which I even though not a Sea food lover, loved. Oh and not to forget the hot n sour soup which was also great. The only down side was that they didn't have a proper prayer area for women, they did have the space though, should've just made it more appropriate for prayers.

We were at ? Mirage? last night with my whole family and it was an amazing wonderful experience. The first thing which appealed me was how the entire restaurant has been put into place, the architectural decent with classic night sea view, arrangement was quite impressive. Even though the place was packed to its full capacity, we have reservation, we were sitting at sea side view was simply mesmerizing \nSince it was our first visit at Mirage buffet dinner, we were told the every person in pretty detailed about variety of buffet food that is being offered, I found, was pretty good; for those who love traditional food stuffs there's BBQs, karhai? biryani , other desi food and for the ones who prefer Sea food, Chinese there were all sorts of desert and varieties of tasty salads available. With the arrangement of such dishes and ambience, I'd personally recommend for anyone who is going there for the very ...first time to try out their fry Parowan, fish battair and Desert (Strawberry cheese ice cream , hot fresh Gulob jaman ) are amazing. Everything was just yum!

Tempura is a  different batter.\n\nthe Koel Burger - not a huge monster that has competitions named after them - but like the place - elegant almost a small sized - but that was just the appearance - coz the beef pattie between the deceptive bun - was huge thick, juicy not overly seasoned - so the taste of great quality meat was apparent. i had forgotten to tell the waiter i don't like vegetables in my burger - but am so glad that i had - coz the lettuce was crisp and fresh, the tomatoes just enough and the surprise was the grilled aubergine under the cheese - AMAZING. a MUST try for all the burger lovers in town ( Bilal Alvi when you go please warn them - so they can have a few ready - mashallah at the speed you consume them - the chef will have trouble grilling them)\n\nby the time i got around to eat the fries they had become cold (remember i was sitting outside) small suggestion - please english mustard. but i didn't need ANY sauces - not even ketchup.\n\ni didn't sample the chicken but was told it was succulent and grilled to perfection - the garlic rice and the teriyaki sauce i did sample - the rice were yum, soft but not squidgy bursting with flavors and aromas - the teriyaki sauce was a little sweet for me and a little pale.\n\nover all a very pleasant evening - cant wait to arrange the ladies brunch there - when there will be lovely sunlight to make the experience even more amazing.\n\ncoffee and dessert were somewhere else - so thats another story!!!!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-02-06T20:39:56+0000","like_count":11,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"641495625","name":"Bilal Alvi","type":"user","offset":1698,"length":10}]},{"id":"312209862163504","from":{"name":"Rasikh Ismail","id":"721051281"},"message":"Thank you every one for your suggestions and compliments.
