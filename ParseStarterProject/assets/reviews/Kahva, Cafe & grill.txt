It was great back then.\n\nHaven't been there in some time but I did get some stuff delivered a few times over the past 2 months. My last delivery order was pretty messed up though. Had their Dijon Chicken, which was very, very bad. The Chicken strips I ordered were stale as well.\n\nTheir pastas used to be great, as well as their salads, and most of their chicken entrees, but don't know about now. Their steaks were okay too back then.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T17:09:53+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"100004099794190","name":"Sameen","type":"user","offset":0,"length":6}]},{"id":"592955660755588","from":{"name":"Kashif Malim","id":"766095724"},"message":"Here is their menu: https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/534255_10151085488516022_540882296_n.jpg","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T17:10:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"592973600753794","from":{"name":"Fatima Ali Rizvi","id":"503561922"},"message":"Chicken chilli dry, Thai soup, chicken alakiev and their chocolate kava is really good","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T17:28:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"592978374086650","from":{"name":"Amad Ul Hasan Siddiqui","id":"538934895"},"message":"Moroccan chicken. just ask them to go easy on salt on everything :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T17:31:58+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"592978647419956","from":{"name":"Maliha Burney","id":"1562400203"},"message":"moroccan chicken and lava cake","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T17:33:08+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"592980580753096","from":{"name":"Sairah Hassan","id":"505990155"},"message":"chicken bon bon, so yum","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-07-26T17:39:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"592981144086373","from":{"name":"Anum Javed Qureshi","id":"647220220"},"message":"Their desserts are juss awesome!!!
