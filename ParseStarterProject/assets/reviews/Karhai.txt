It was a successful event and we had a great time meeting new people :)  \n\nFirstly last night was one of the coldest nights by far and I thought we were going to turn into popsicles but thanks to the  management at Sajjad that didn't happen. It was unusually and surprisingly warm. Its covered from all sides and has fires burning at different spots which is really nice. So this answers the question for all who have been seeking a warm spot at do darya.\n\nNow to the FOOD.\nStarters: Chicken Dhakka, Hot and Sour Soup, BBQ prawns, lemon chicken and fish dhakka.\n\nMains: Afghani Boti, Chicken karhai, Shahi Handi.\n\nSTARTERS:\n? Chicken Dhakka: \n The most loved starter off all time I assume. It had been wiped clean off the dish as soon as it hit the table. Boneless chicken fried in a delicious batter served with this amazing sauce. Hands down the best dish on the menu and a must must try.\n\n?Hot & Sour Soup:\nDefiantly has room for improvement. But since we were sitting in a Pakistani themed Resturant i didn't expect a tiny Chinese man dancing out of my soup. So all good.\n\n?BBQ Prawns: \nOk i am not a seafood person at all. So according to the people who ate them they did enjoy. Its a very interesting dish. Plain simple flavours which enhanced the taste of the prawns \n\n?Lemon Chicken:\nAnother of my favorites. YUM i felt like im in chicken heaven. Crunchy chicken fried perfectly packed with that lemon zing. At the same time it didnt over power the chicken.\nI would keep going back for that.\n\n?Fish Dhaka:\nAnother one of the yummi delights. Me not being a sea food person fell for them like i slipped on a banana peel. \nMust try again. A complete winter dish\n\nMAINS:\nWe had stuffed our selfs with the starters lol\n\n?Chicken Karhai:\nJust has a taste but now i know why are they famous for it. Tasted yum.\n\n?Afghani Beef Boti:\nI can keep returning for that every single day. Soft, filled with taste, melts in the mouth. Neither to spicy neither bland just the right amount of spices.\n\n?Shahi Chicken Handi:\nA shahi handi for a shahi gathering lol. \nI love it. Boneless chicken chunks cooked in butter and topped with cheese and hints of fresh herbs. It has that yummy creamy subtle taste. Geez my mouth still waters for it. Total justice to the dish.\n\nOverall: \nGreat service.\nFood arrived hot and on time.\nAttentive staff.\nLoved the plastic covers against the wind. \n\nSpecial thankyou to all the foodies that showed up. \nHope to see u all soon.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-12-29T14:35:00+0000","updated_time":"2014-01-02T21:31:24+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100005421823588","name":"Aamir Dayo"},{"id":"541880374","name":"Noreen Ahmed"},{"id":"100001434743152","name":"Raza Rehmani"},{"id":"1382361256","name":"Sajjad Ahmed"},{"id":"624632099","name":"Mrym Qureshi"},{"id":"100000661397453","name":"Adeel Baig"},{"id":"100002961375023","name":"Karim Sewani"},{"id":"100003570224157","name":"Kashif Khan"},{"id":"100001356574653","name":"Rude Plannet Kennel Rpk"},{"id":"807675696","name":"Yasir Billoo"},{"id":"1073365051","name":"Hassan Saleem"},{"id":"532470690","name":"Sana Zaeem"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"887535136","name":"Jabbar Abdul"},{"id":"100000349804754","name":"Sarah Arij"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"796000540","name":"Nisa Abdul Basit Khan"},{"id":"100001217752738","name":"MehRose Khan"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"729875068","name":"Soomro Ali"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"733018407","name":"Nabeel Kazi"},{"id":"100002943458913","name":"Aisha Wali Muhammad"},{"id":"1356485615","name":"Samrah Owais"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzQ5MjA0NTUy","before":"MTAwMDA1NDIxODIzNTg4"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_674208709296949/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNzQ5MjA0NTUy"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"674210079296812","from":{"name":"Zohaib Ali Memon","id":"524501080"},"message":"need to make it to one of these some day","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:38:13+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213699296450","from":{"name":"Deen Sheikh","id":"219000363"},"message":"So who all came?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:10+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674213745963112","from":{"name":"Khozema Soni","id":"513558813"},"message":"If this event took place why was that girl siting alone ?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-12-29T14:47:18+0000","like_count":3,"user_likes":false},{"id":"674216695962817","from":{"name":"Ayesha Khan","id":"602863744"},"message":"Khozema Soni well there was a bit of miscommunication.

(My dad is an ultimate nakhray wale uncle:p like the one who calls a steak gosht ka tukda, a pizza 'roti utay boti' and so on) so I always opt for desi with dad since he tends to be very particular with expense directly proportional to taste! Went for an early dinner to Khanji and were seated immediately (1. the weather was lovely, I loved how I ate desi with those back support chairs I could sink into after a long tedious day). Moving to the menu, really extensive, efficiently put together... Ordered Mutton Peshaweri Karhai, Shish Taouk...on asking about the serving we were told there would be 6 pieces so we order yet another 2 items (we dint know they wudnt be tiny pieces, instead king kong pieces) ordered fish tikka and Namkeen Boti. Dad was disappointed for no tandoori roti and only having chapati as an option! Waiter immediately said they can get from another eatery and so we ordered both\nPumpkin Meetha(I don't eat pumpkins, cant say much :))\nThe POST MORTEM:\nMutton Peshaweri Karhai: Nothing like those al habib or Kolachi tastes! Distinct flavors, loved how tender the meat was (I do not eat mutton apart from home but i surprisingly did!). Maybe the right tinge of Peshawer 10/10\n\nNamkeem Boti: I thought they'd be somehow salty (Namkeem wohi hota hai na?) But I think well marinated Chicken with an unbelievably managed execution, 10/10\n\nShish Taouk: A different version of Malai Boti, perhaps with some arabic spices maybe? (y m i being a chef? lol I'd rate it 8/10)\n\nFarmaishi Chapatti : Loved it, literally chapati had some peshaweri khan baba ki rooh in it maybe? The tandoori rotiz kept sadofying while we had our hands onto the chapati\n\nFish Tikka: Uff...Uff...Uff...

Did not even bother checking them this time. I love my food but waiting an hour plus for being seated is a buzzkill for me, heck it's even longer then it takes me to eat sometimes. Hence Kolachi was a BIG NO... *sigh*\n\nEnded up going to Al Sajjad as it's become quite a favorite of mine during the last couple of months.\nTook hardly around 5 mins to be seated (im very picky about seating). Must say I love it better then the others, it's not too crowded (means lesser people staring at us eating while they wait :p) and iv always gotten amazing service and taste with next to no time wastage ..\n\nNow Food...\nOrdered Fish Dhaka and Chicken Dhaka, Lemon Chicken, Malai Boti, and Chicken Karhai..\nBoth Fish and Dhaka Chicken tasted amazing as ever. Crunchy on the outside and soft inside. The quantity was very generous plus the taste which made it impossible to keep my hand away hence I was quite full to attack the others.\n\nLemon chicken was creamy with a hint of lime.\n\nDid not have the stomach to try the malai boti and karhai but the family loved it, so il take their word for it. \n\nOne extra point for how carefully they pack the left over food upon request. Proper tiny boxes, was warm even when I opened it at home. \n\nYet again they have managed to make me very happy. Great food and even better service. *Double Thumbs Up*\n\nOne little advice though, I would appreciate a better choice of music in the background.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-09-16T19:29:28+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-17T09:50:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100002548971617","name":"Fiza Jawaid"},{"id":"100001830205217","name":"Talha Habib"},{"id":"1172956793","name":"Mansoor Ahmed"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"524835210","name":"Ali Dayo"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"1385831564","name":"Mehvish Ayaz"},{"id":"100002698452985","name":"Rabia Mahmood"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"511130593","name":"Layla Rizvi"},{"id":"1041024143","name":"Muhammad Ali Piracha"},{"id":"620585988","name":"Midhat Mirza"},{"id":"1053980754","name":"Wajeeha Amir"},{"id":"512612823","name":"Leena Faruqui"},{"id":"100000533457073","name":"Tooba Saleem Rindani"},{"id":"687185098","name":"Syed Fawad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"Njg3MTg1MDk4","before":"MTAwMDAyNTQ4OTcxNjE3"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619768214740999","from":{"name":"Syed Fawad","id":"687185098"},"message":"Yes  true I think in nearby future this strip of rest at Do darya might shutdown  down soon & I luv the view from each rest kolachi , ambalA , al sajad &many more I luv the food there , view is amazing value if money is also good","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T19:45:00+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619768324740988","from":{"name":"Syed Fawad","id":"687185098"},"message":"Value of money *","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-16T19:45:29+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619774244740396","from":{"name":"Zahid Ali Shahid","id":"2531013"},"message":"Ur like obsessed with Sajjad, lol.

A non-pretentious dining place in Zamzama, serving clean flavorful food at a reasonable price.  The place does suffer from an identity crisis, but that does not have any effect on the quality of food served.\n\nOrdered Boneless Chicken Karhai, Club Sandwich, and Meethi Puri.  The Chicken Karhai was delicious, with the masala having a clean distinct flavor, with minimal oil.  It may not be the best Karhai in the city, but it certainly is one of the cleaner ones.  Club Sandwich was filling, and wasn't really loaded with useless assortments -- just the right mix of all ingredients.  I'm the last person to care about hygiene, Methi Puri had that tangy flavor, and is a good option (albeit at a price) for hygiene freaks.\n\nWith a cost of PKR450 per head for three people looking for a light flavorful dinner -- Cafeela is the place to be.  The only downside: the menu is fairly limited -- something like Menu of the Day, or availability of new dishes every week might do the trick.  And yea, unlike other places in the vicinity -- the place had sufficient lighting to ensure that the patron doesn't go blind while reading the menu, or eating the meal.\n\nRecommended for a clean, flavorful, and a pocket friendly experience.\n\nOverall Rating -- 8/10.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-09-15T11:56:23+0000","updated_time":"2013-09-15T19:15:03+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"695776393","name":"Nayab Qureshi"},{"id":"732917968","name":"Qazi Furqan"},{"id":"504764674","name":"Abeer Ammar Khan"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"100002850760185","name":"Nayab Ali"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"100002543982613","name":"Ujala Iqbal Kureishi"},{"id":"646760193","name":"Rehma Tirmizey"},{"id":"821064236","name":"Talha Iftkhar"},{"id":"628102086","name":"Rehman Ray Saiyed"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI4MTAyMDg2","before":"Njk1Nzc2Mzkz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"619262154791605","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"Great review","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-15T18:54:47+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"619268914790929","from":{"name":"Ammar Habib Khan","id":"685505866"},"message":"Thanks Hajra!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-09-15T19:15:03+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjE5MjY4OTE0NzkwOTI5","before":"NjE5MjYyMTU0NzkxNjA1"}}},"restaurantName":"Karhai"},{"id":"165861103465048_616297088421445","from":{"name":"Syed Arsalan Tariq","id":"570440986"},"message":"Mutton charsi karahi.

I am sorry but I dont agree with you on this.\nLets go step by step.\nStarting with Sajjad Restaurant taking only spill over crowd ? I think Sajjad and Kolachi both come under the same league. Everyone has a different taste but at the same time I think Sajjad has a good fan following and many loyal customers. Plus its a bigger restaurant so it can absorb more walk in customers. \nNext is food.\nYour food can be written as creatively as you want. If you want a chicken dhaka (one of their most popular dish) to be just some average chicken pakora then be it. It can at the same time be crispy fillets of breast chicken batter coated and fried to perfection, served with fries onion rings and sauces, the perfect start to your meal.\n\nIn the same way even the best of karhais for you might be a handful of botis cooked in a karhai, with tomatoes and green chillies.\nWhat I also didnt understand was the fact that following your list of complains it was written that the it was not bad. No smell in the meat and it was tender and cooked in the right way.\nSo was it good or bad ???\n\nAnyhow I wish you a speedy recovery from your medical condition and I hope you enjoy the meal.\nCheers","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-19T18:31:18+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"606013989449755","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"Razak Latif first of all Aamir Basrai is the last person to give a false account of his experience.

A lot has been written about it already, and it is probably one of the very few places which has an impeccable service record -- yet to find someone who hates it!\n\nWent to Kolachi on the third day of Eid, after a hiatus of about a year, and as expected the place was PACKED.  Atleast somewhere around 1000 individuals dining in, while roughly 500 just waiting to be seated -- and yet, everything went smooth.  The management wasn't freaking out, everything was under control, and more importantly the staff was courteous -- devoid of 'I'm working on Eid, so deal with my attitude' sort of behavior.  The food was served within 20-25 minutes of ordering, despite the insane rush -- and all of the food was served at the right temperature.  \n\nOne doesn't have to remind the management there twice about an order, which is often the case with many other places.  At the end of the meal, someone from the management was courteous enough to ask about the experience, and any suggestions; and are actually happy if one provides any criticism for further improvement (unlike many others out here).\n\nWe ordered Peshawari Karhai, Hunzai Karhai, Katakat, and Makhni Handi.  The karhai was delicious, although it may not be the best in the city, but given the ambiance, the flavor was just fine.  The creamy and delicious Makhni Handi is probably the best in the city, closely followed by Tandoori Hut.  The Katakat was pretty bland and sad, but that didn't really matter a lot.  With 13 persons, the bill came up to roughly PKR650 per person, which is pretty reasonable given the service quality, flavor, and the ambiance.\n\nKolachi should start up a boot camp to train the plethora of restaurants out here who are not able to serve even 20 individuals at the same time (let alone 1000!), and have egos the size of Mount Everest to understand the simple needs of a customer.  \n\nDespite the volume, Kolachi is able to do a commendable job, and certainly deserves all the praise that is written about it time and again.  Without any random service charges, without any pretentious attitude, without any rats (and hair), and without humiliating the customer, Kolachi is able to do a bloody good job.  Highly recommended despite an average waiting time of 60 minutes.\n\nOverall Rating -- 9/10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-12T22:56:39+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-13T18:34:21+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"692650033","name":"Shahbaz Khan"},{"id":"1627178378","name":"Zubair Aziz"},{"id":"706724744","name":"Sara Khalid-Asad"},{"id":"100001187356169","name":"Kanwal Durrani"},{"id":"1639697717","name":"Sadia Zaheer"},{"id":"659377501","name":"Somia Rizwan"},{"id":"1058959259","name":"Furqan Zafar Batla"},{"id":"534041252","name":"Faizan Yahya"},{"id":"100005715342653","name":"Sikandar Gaba"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"566412813","name":"Mehreen Farhat Adil"},{"id":"792915494","name":"Ahmad Fayyaz Ali"},{"id":"665600385","name":"Yasir Ansari"},{"id":"749604523","name":"Muhammad Umer Khan"},{"id":"504565020","name":"Shehzad Ghias Shaikh"},{"id":"100004312661028","name":"Lyla Byramji"},{"id":"552080867","name":"Tabassum Ali"},{"id":"100001653271774","name":"Vardah Zamir"},{"id":"720585459","name":"Aisha Abrar"},{"id":"630661421","name":"Mariam Ali"},{"id":"673798071","name":"Sarmad Tahir"},{"id":"715140026","name":"Saniya Surani"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"684790179","name":"Farooq Shaikh"},{"id":"668781078","name":"Asim Raza"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY4NzgxMDc4","before":"NjkyNjUwMDMz"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_602343696483451/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjY4NzgxMDc4"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"602420949809059","from":{"name":"Muhammad Atif","id":"659193156"},"message":"Totally agreed for 'Karahi' point.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-13T02:55:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"602454326472388","from":{"name":"Tauseef Haider","id":"1412656399"},"message":"Nicely described.

As previously complained ^^. around Iftar lots of things were already finished, which is understandable, the workers have to open their fast as well, but no excuse for that later in the evening ... \n\nSometimes I got lucky and got warm, fresh food (mostly from the live counters), which was definitely on par. \n\nAbout the food, it was good, the spice was on point. The mutton Karhai, mutton & chicken sajji, and the fried fish were all excellent.\n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed, and at that price point (1200) , I would have much rather visited Kolachi.

So yesterday I decided to give them a visit. And with no surprises, everything I heard was true. Endless variety of food including BBQ, Chinese, Handi, Afghani, Italian,etc. ,etc., and what not. Although, the differentiating factor which separates Kolachi from all other infinite menu list buffets in town, each and every item was fresh and scrumptious and hard to resist, making it impossible to taste all of them. Specialties being Prawn tempura, Malai Boti, Paneer Reshmi, OOzi and Karhai. These are items for which you definitely need reserve some space in your appetite. And what to say about desserts, simply divine and celestial.\nA few negligible cons, long ques on high running items but visible efforts by staff to manage the crowd.  Secondly, when I called them two days back to reserve the water front table, I was told that they are not making reservations. Therefore I made sure to reach max by 6:15 pm, and was told that all water front tables are already reserved!!!!! And lastly the sitting area in the lounge was very hot and dark and to make it worse, red dim light hanging over our head. \nAll in all, I would like to thank Kolachi for treating my taste buds although there is still room to improve their aesthetics.\nScore : 8.5 /10","type":"status","created_time":"2013-08-02T06:15:00+0000","updated_time":"2013-08-02T10:27:53+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"716476797","name":"Rania Jawaid"},{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"690005614","name":"Owais Asif"},{"id":"100000108654676","name":"Samia Hyder"},{"id":"100002991745435","name":"Asmma Omer Khan"},{"id":"678739600","name":"Sarah Siraj"},{"id":"1200204425","name":"Sana Zaidi"},{"id":"100003829944979","name":"Saba Farooq"},{"id":"660435505","name":"Sajjad Bin Ali"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjYwNDM1NTA1","before":"Njk5OTE4ODMw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"596871450364009","from":{"name":"Saad Ahmed Qureshi","id":"739137597"},"message":"thnx for the detailed review, its helpfull","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-08-02T10:27:53+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTk2ODcxNDUwMzY0MDA5","before":"NTk2ODcxNDUwMzY0MDA5"}}},"restaurantName":"Karhai"},{"id":"165861103465048_594735987244222","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"If I were to have SEHRI at Boat basin, recommend a place & what they serve best.

Mirage is the only buffet themed restaurant at Do-Darya and is located right next to Kolachi. The ambience is nothing to write about as it?s almost the same as Kolachi, Charcoal, etc. We booked the whole upper deck unanimously for the view and later regretted the decision as the main food stations were downstairs.\nThe food stations are divided into 3 areas. The main food station is at the entrance while the BBQ section is at the upper left corner of the restaurant. The dessert and salad bar is in the top right corner.\nFor the price (Rs. 1000 per person inclusive of 1 soft drink) the food was very good. There were fresh batair?s (better than Lal-Qila?s), fried prawn tempura, Chicken Biryani, Goan Fish Curry, Chapli Kabab, pani puri are just some of the dishes that were tasted. The highlights however were the BBQ and the live chicken Karhai. The BBQ consisted of Chicken Malai Boti, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Chicken Tikka and Beef Namkeen Boti. The Malai Boti was succulent (but a little sweet for my taste) while Reshmi Kabab and Tikka were awesomely cooked (and Thank God not overcooked)  bu the Beef Namkeen Boti stole the show as it literally melted in our mouths.\nThe Karhai also has 4 varieties namely Peneer White, Peshawari Red, Green Masala and Namkeen Red Karhai. All four varieties were delicious and much better than what Kolachi serves.\nThe let down at Mirage were the salad and dessert station due to same variety as other buffets and also fried fish and the pasta dishes.\nOverall we really enjoyed our food and had a fantastic evening. Best part was that there was no hassle from the waiters or the mangers to clear the table (like they do at Kolachi & Ginsoy).","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-27T18:52:26+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-29T09:29:10+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"736425186","name":"Maryam Zahoor Ansari"},{"id":"772910592","name":"Shyam Sunder"},{"id":"100001652686360","name":"DrAsifa Sheeraz"},{"id":"100000226962956","name":"Sumiaya Arif"},{"id":"575276752","name":"Shahana Ahmed"},{"id":"801070581","name":"Soha Shakil Khan"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"711050864","name":"Abdul Raheem Khan"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAwNzEyMDgxMDY2","before":"NzM2NDI1MTg2"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"548935991824222","from":{"name":"Soha Shakil Khan","id":"801070581"},"message":"Aaquib Arif","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-27T21:28:00+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"579575057","name":"Aaquib Arif","type":"user","offset":0,"length":11}]},{"id":"549210141796807","from":{"name":"Zarfras Siddiki","id":"100003898006618"},"message":"seems they(Kolachi and Ginsoy) are quite busy in their business and they care for walk in customers,to avoid waiting in queue,,caring for customers by Kolachi and Ginsoy thats good,,","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T08:19:11+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549233218461166","from":{"name":"Muhammed Umer Mulla","id":"595408686"},"message":"Well yes but what if you are in thr middle of a meal and the bill is presented to you or when you try to relax the waiter constantly remind you to clear the table as they have a big cue....I mean can't they wait for say 5 mins","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T09:48:26+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549380488446439","from":{"name":"Sumiaya Arif","id":"100000226962956"},"message":"I second that muhammed umer mulla","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-28T14:42:21+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"549876995063455","from":{"name":"Mujtaba Sistanwala","id":"676423132"},"message":"5-7 Mins should be max before which the Bill sould be asked for & settled.

My 2 other (older) kids also love sea food so BOTS was an obvious choice for us. We reached there at 9m, ordered Red Fish Finger and Dhaka Fish Finger, Fried Prawns and Prawns Karhai.  The service was prompt and the food as good as always. While we were enjoying our meal, our newest addition to the family felt left out and insisted on tying the Dhaka Fish Finger so wifey gave her a small piece and...whoa...it was like love at first bite for her (although technically she cant bite right now) . To our surprise, she had quite a few pieces after that and thoroughly enjoyed the meal.  Guess some of us have only acquired the BOTS taste, this generation is born with it. \n\nMy kids went to Ali Raza to thank him for a lovely meal and he reciprocated and came to meet us as well.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-12-03T13:16:13+0000","updated_time":"2012-12-05T08:44:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1551738621","name":"Syed Yousuf A?idi"},{"id":"1415943200","name":"Kamran Salahuddin"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"720217622","name":"Aruna Dawani"},{"id":"741385426","name":"Riaz Salim"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"751819688","name":"Erum Hamza"},{"id":"512589628","name":"Jawwad Raza"},{"id":"100000860154915","name":"Aman Jaffery"},{"id":"100000688182502","name":"Asim Mohammad Ali"},{"id":"617680709","name":"Fatima Ali Rizvi"},{"id":"751030900","name":"Zoha Manzar"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"708025491","name":"Sarah J.K"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"631611761","name":"Adnan Zafar"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"528525436","name":"Umtus Sanna Hussain-Mirza"},{"id":"591211818","name":"Hafsa Zulfiqar"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTE3Mjg3Mzkz","before":"MTU1MTczODYyMQ\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"467861749931647","from":{"name":"Sharmeen Sharif","id":"702746868"},"message":"Well Aneek I have ordered BOTS twice but both times I was really disappointed with their service :( ....the first time I ordered they sent me something different from what I actually ordered ...

With the expectation bar at its peak after hearing and reading so much about it on SWOT and outside, I was a bit apprehensive while going. What if it doesn?t turn out as good? What if my grandiose expectations fall flat? Oh well. Nevermind, I reassured myself and our group of 10 with bachas in it went ahead. We reached well after 830pm thanks to the jam packed sea view road that tested both my patience and driving skills. Finally when we reached we were told by the courteous lady at the entrance that we?ll have to wait for anywhere between 30 to 40 minutes to get a table for 10. Though I was warned of the weekend rush that picks up after 830pm my own miscalculation prevented me from pre-booking. Thanks to Muneer Esmail and the ever courteous staff of Kolachi, we managed to get a table well before the time given. And what a lovely spot it was. I could?ve easily spent hours sitting up on the deck overlooking the sea and enjoying the lovely environs. Kolachi cleared its first test with full marks! \n\nThe gentleman who appeared to be the Manager helped us settle and ensured we were comfortable. Our group relied on me to order (knowing fully well that I am the worst at the job). However, thanks to my earlier post on SWOT, I had received some recommendations and decided to play safe. So my pick included Paneer Reshmi Handi, Peshawari Karhai (in Chicken as the group was not inclined towards red meat) and Kolachi Reshmi Kabab. As much as we wanted to try out starters, we chose not too as the popcorns at Cineplex right before the journey to Kolachi didn?t allow that. So we settled on the main course. For this trip only! \n\nBachas in our group are notorious for ordering fries wherever they go! They frown and fret and make a fuss if they don?t find their favorite starter. Fortunately Kolachi didn?t let us down there! Kids were happy with cheesy and Masala fries to start off their meal. For drinks, I went ahead with Muneer?s recommendation and ordered Blue Colada. Some in the group ordered Lemon Mint Glacier while the rest settled for soft drinks or fresh lime. \n\nFood at Kolachi came, saw and conquered! Literally! Paneer Reshmi Handi was well beyond our expectations. It was simply divine! I profusely thanked SWOTTIES who recommended it!! I wanted to devour more than my appetite allowed. And I did. Peshawari Karhai was well cooked and tasted heavenly. With roghni naan, the food was sheer delight. Reshmi Kababs were fresh and tender. They complemented well. \n\nI am forever thankful to Muneer for recommending Blue Colada! It was fantastic. I acted the bad one by not sharing it with anybody which I usually do. The evil me had it all and craved for more!! However I didn?t want to explode so resisted. There was no space left for even tea. So we got up after the lovely food and an excellent service. I must compliment the staff. I wonder how they remain so polite and attentive given the number of people frequenting the place and demanding personalized service! Hats off to the management of Kolachi. \n\nNeedless to say Kolachi is on my radar now and I?ll be visiting the place more often!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-07-16T06:26:33+0000","updated_time":"2012-07-16T19:42:33+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"524476735","name":"Syed Faizan Rahim"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"583446948","name":"Sameer Beg"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"508922509","name":"Mehvish Abubakar"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"710470882","name":"Hina Fatima"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"688336352","name":"Abbas Farid"},{"id":"100000712081066","name":"Asher Jamal"},{"id":"501415716","name":"Hareem Sumbul"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjI1OTY4OTUz","before":"NTI0NDc2NzM1"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"413375985380224","from":{"name":"Farhat Rabia","id":"625968953"},"message":"Yum!!

Golden Dragon - My new love for Thai and Chinese food. Hot favourites: American Chopsuey, Crispy Beef, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Chicken Manchurian, Hot and Sour Soup, Thai Soup, Thai Green Curry, Wontons, Zingers and Chicken Karhai (the last two from their Lunch Xpress section)\n\n2. Log Inn Lounge - Home away from home, Najam sb's warm and friendly attitude is the USP of the place jo khanay mein 4 chand laga detay hain. Their fries and burgers are my utmost fav!\n\n3. Mirchi 360 - Coz sometimes that chutni with any roll is ALL you need in life.\n\n4. Karachi Broast - Great value for money, broast just does NOT get better than KB. And that white+red sauce with fries... MAJOR SLURP.\n\n5. BOTS - Great dossas, great rolls, great prawn karahi, great shashlick, BOTS again super value for money with a gracious host/owner who is amidst all the smoke is never short of smiles. I'm not a fish or crab or lobster person but everything else from daal chawal to prawns is a must have at BOTS.\n\n6. Jade Garden - The only place I have been to for chinese dine-in till date with complete satisfaction. This place, in my opinion, is GD in physical form. I love all the stuff here that I love at GD inclusive of Schezwan Chicken.\n\n7. KFC - Sorry guys but this place has never ever disappointed me. Be it a midnight deal at Badar Comm or the Seaview one or normal food. I didnt like their Panini AT ALL but that Zinger......its an integral part of my system. There is no way I am ever going to say goodbye to this place.\n\n8. Nandos - What is NOT to love at Nandos. I can eat Nandos 3 times a day for weeks on end and still crave for more. Those sauces, their wings, their peri bites, burgers, the trinchado, their steak meal....I dont care if the clifton branch gives me shrinked murghis, I did complain when my cataplana tasted like homemade taheri BUT there is no way the \"love\" is ever becoming \"like\" for this place. I am forever indebted a peri addict for life!\n\n9. Royals Ice n Spice - The best tikka in town, the yummiest beef burger I have EVER had, the best place in Sindhi Muslim for fast food at awesome tareen prices and excellent taste!\n\n10. Karachi Foods - Fav place for biryani. Period.\n\nI would also like to especially mention my one-time trips, but InshaAllah more to follow, at the following places:\n\n1. Forty4 - I am in awe. This is fine dining at its peak. The Chilli Basil Chicken is a must have.\n\n2. Olivetto - Need to go and have that best in town bread n butter pudding soon!! Along with their awesome lounge deals!! Must try: Club Sandwich \u003c3\n\n3. Kolachi - The best place on the phase 8 strip. In every sense of the word. Hunzai Handi blew me away. Will go soon to be blown away by other things too.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-06-25T18:59:25+0000","updated_time":"2012-06-27T14:47:17+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"657031744","name":"Khalid Saleem"},{"id":"505164013","name":"Yasmeen Agad-Kothawala"},{"id":"515396294","name":"Danish Ali Dahraj"},{"id":"100003249618202","name":"Heer Ahmed"},{"id":"100002967504159","name":"Ronica Shanzay"},{"id":"500907007","name":"Murtaza Moiz"},{"id":"1133719630","name":"Saira Malik"},{"id":"531528379","name":"Bushra Nauman"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"770358065","name":"Beenish Mithani-Salim"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"665091820","name":"Ayesha Chundrigar"},{"id":"543651722","name":"Ayesha Omer Zuberi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NTQzNjUxNzIy","before":"NjU3MDMxNzQ0"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"404073356310487","from":{"name":"Najam Quddusi","id":"670100198"},"message":"i see myself featured here too, obliged and humbled Hajra Amir","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T19:33:23+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir","type":"user","offset":52,"length":10}]},{"id":"404123489638807","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Thank you Hajra :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-06-25T21:13:34+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false,"message_tags":[{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra","type":"user","offset":10,"length":5}]},{"id":"404386042945885","from":{"name":"Hajra Amir","id":"699918830"},"message":"These places are on my fingertips 24/7!!!

My first reaction was like \"abay bohut dakhay hain aise dhabay\". (The same friend also told me that the group name stands for Single Women Over Thirty, reason enuff for me to join the group in the first place). \nLast few days i read so many posts raving about the food, i thought probably the owner has a lot of friends on the group who brags about his food. Khair, finally went to BOTS yesterday, since my kids wanted to have something prawny and it was on my way. We were in a hurry so i thought of grabbing prawn biryani for all of us but kids wanted something gravy so we ordered prawn karhai as suggested by the waiter. I also met Syed Ali Raza Abidi and introduced myself as a SWOTie, while he was doing something fishy. Watching the owner cook himself gave me a lot of assurance about the quality of meal. He seem to me like a nice guy, clean shaved, soft spoken, reasonably dressed, you know the kind of guy your wife wants you to be! \nGot the order in half an hour (good timing). The Karhai had a strong teasing aroma, tempting us while we were driving back home. Shared into 3 unequal portions (i got the least no of prawns;(, we were literally blown away by the karhai masala. The kids literally finished the meal in less than 30 minutes (a new home record) and asking for more! The only regret was the quantity we ordered wasnt enough. \nI dont usually say good things about food (accordingly to my wife the last time i complimented her was when she made Jans ke biryani) but BOTs far exceeded my expectations. To those you havnt tried, i will say what i was told, \"You Are Not A SWOTie if you never been to BOTS!\" \nEnough about BOTS, now can someone please tell if there are really any Single Women Over Thrity on the group?","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-06T14:00:31+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-07T18:10:38+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"537680329","name":"Mohsin Siddiqui"},{"id":"193110460","name":"Mashal Mohammad"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"100001858450013","name":"Nastaran Mustafa"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"693598354","name":"Aisha Naim"},{"id":"100002668961403","name":"Saeeda Rizvi"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"},{"id":"564069764","name":"Faisal Lakhani"},{"id":"100002594564883","name":"Tania Ali Raza"},{"id":"584682243","name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha"},{"id":"1088744265","name":"Waqas Tariq"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"602841758","name":"Rahat Asad Kazi"},{"id":"752647175","name":"Kiran Haroon"},{"id":"726690443","name":"Danial Rizvi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzI2NjkwNDQz","before":"NTM3NjgwMzI5"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"291186784265812","from":{"name":"Kiran Haroon","id":"752647175"},"message":"Great mouth watering review, Aneek!
