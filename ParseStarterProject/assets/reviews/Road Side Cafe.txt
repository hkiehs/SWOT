Its called Super Biryani And Bun Kebab House. Ordered 14 double bun kebabs. Priced at Rs 44 each, it's a bargain. While I have yet to have it, I was told by my sister they aren't really that great. Anyhoo, will let everyone know later how they are. Meanwhile if someone has tried them, feel free to give your opinions. In my books, Dhaga Bun Kebab from Roadside Cafe is still the baap of all bun kebabs in Karachi. It's on the expensive side but worth every penny.","type":"photo","created_time":"2013-11-16T14:36:59+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-18T15:43:16+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1045239004","name":"Taskeen Saim"},{"id":"100007013108103","name":"Marium Khan"},{"id":"100000490298520","name":"Nisreen Munawar"},{"id":"100006083859539","name":"Muhammad Amir"},{"id":"625968953","name":"Farhat Rabia"},{"id":"884185556","name":"Rehma Najeeb"},{"id":"850330576","name":"Salima Malik Feerasta"},{"id":"517287393","name":"Saifullah Mazhar"},{"id":"100003359808853","name":"Arshad Zafar"},{"id":"564985482","name":"Nisa Ali"},{"id":"1135236339","name":"Gauher Taj Raza"},{"id":"845620133","name":"Khurshed Aga"},{"id":"756768261","name":"Muhammad Aslam"},{"id":"517320999","name":"Umair Ummi"},{"id":"100001174868164","name":"Faddy Khan"},{"id":"541880374","name":"Noreen Ahmed"},{"id":"749204552","name":"Rabeet Rao"},{"id":"549655574","name":"Nazish Huda"},{"id":"628491674","name":"Sana Shoaib"},{"id":"723750302","name":"Saad Ali"},{"id":"1251361318","name":"Tooba Rehman"},{"id":"750786806","name":"Faixa Shah"},{"id":"557355290","name":"Zaid Sheikh"},{"id":"1014440534","name":"Kamran Yousuf"},{"id":"669320704","name":"Fahad Azad"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY5MzIwNzA0","before":"MTA0NTIzOTAwNA\u003d\u003d"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/165861103465048_651710068213480/likes?access_token\u003d598789110193809|574c2ac434c6106bd4b3d4550b7df201&limit\u003d25&after\u003dNjY5MzIwNzA0"}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"651711391546681","from":{"name":"Rehman Ray Saiyed","id":"628102086"},"message":"Let's go there when I'm in Karachi in Dec Faisal!!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-16T14:40:55+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"651712701546550","from":{"name":"Bushra Munir","id":"552274552"},"message":"Is it better than Azad Bun Kebab opposite Fresco?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-16T14:44:14+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"651713464879807","from":{"name":"Taseer Abbas","id":"1379972067"},"message":"Had this on wednesday, very same place.
