The only consistency was the hour long delivery time. The fish in the fish and chips used to be the size and thickness of a grown mans hand -tonight much, much smaller and so thin I peeled off the layer of batter to uncover a sliver, literally, of fish. And then more battered crumbs. Very disappointed. The prawn biryani that was delivered was a single though we ordered a double (and were charged for a double)  and barely had prawns. Earlier BOTS' prawn biryani was prawn-loaded. Chicken tikka biryani was nice but the rice in both the biryani tasted pretty much the same. The culinary scene in Karachi is already suffering the loss of Upper Crust and Cafe Blue Ginger - I hope BOTS doesn't compromise on its quality because it really is what I was looking forward to after a year away from the city.","type":"status","created_time":"2013-04-06T16:48:10+0000","updated_time":"2013-04-06T21:08:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz","before":"NjA2Mjc4MDcz"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"535065616544593","from":{"name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi","id":"606278073"},"message":"Haider: when did this happen?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-04-06T17:00:38+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"535066026544552","from":{"name":"Haider Ali Gulfaraz","id":"712140598"},"message":"Tonight.

As always, the service was attentive and gracious despite the place filling up rapidly after we got there. Interestingly enough, we were concerned that we had young Mr. Ali with us but we were in good company with a variety of families with children of all ages. Says something about the comfort level of parents with the place! However I must point out that we are talking about an early dinner, like 7.15ish so that may have had something to do with it. We also hurried the delivery of the meal due to Mr. Ali Masood's presence and the staff made it happen!!\n\nThe Blue Cheese souffle might have been the best we have ever had at CBG and of course, we had to order two to ensure we got our fix properly! My steak was nicely cooked with all my usual idiosyncrasies catered for as were the two chicken dishes ordered by Mariyam Masood and her mother\n(Chicken with Jalapeno Cream, Chicken with Grain Mustard). Consistently medium rare steak is difficult to achieve but CBG has always managed to get it done with maybe a rare exception somewhere in the distant past. As a steak lover, that is one thing that I appreciate tremendously!\n\nOn a hunch, I ordered the Pomegranate juice for Mariyam and she thought it was very very good. While I took off to the car with Ali, Mariyam and Amma polished off a molten lava despite being quite full after a robust meal.\n\nSufficed to say, we satisfied our craving and had a wonderful evening at CBG once again. Unfortunately we missed Hussain Tariq since he was busy taking care of his unwell father but I did get the chance to speak to him today to share that we had a great experience at CBG once agein.

However, the one problem i noticed all three times was that the food kept finishing and wasnt refilled at the right time. Seemed ok in the first week of Ramzan but shuoldve fixed the problem by the last. Oh well.\n- Kolachi - Great food, but tooooooo crowded. Wouldnt bother going for iftar again. Definitely would try it on another day for food.\n- Cafe Blue Ginger - Good food. Rubbish service.\n- Deli - Excellent menu selection and food was really tasty.

Sensible ?cause it?s NOT all fried food, different ?cause it?s not the same old bastardization of typical high-tea/Iftar items. The Dahi-pulkiyan were better than burns road, the Pokoras were too (personally best I?ve ever had, and I?ve had my share : ) then there was the fresh salad w/ a lovely and equally fresh vinaigrette, a decent hummus, the most perfectly saut?ed chicken wings (?jin ke size per maat jana??had plenty of perfectly succulent meat on it ; ) in a sweet & sour smother : D and the mini burgers (better than the big one I had@GunSmoke last night, which was a damn fine burger in its own right) but this atypical out of this world finest meat on a lightly toasted bun just blew me away!!!  The brilliant sea food poppers w/ quality tartar sauce made this Iftar and dinner really stand out from the pack. And I haven?t even gotten to the dollars and cents yet? We?ll get to that in a minute. \nIt is also worth mentioning that the buffet had several other items which I couldn?t even try, simply cause there is a limit to how much I can eat : P but others told me of the oriental noodles, and other items I can?t even remember. \nWhat a deal, 5star quality (and I don?t mean pakistani-5?ishtaaar?but international standard) food which included 4 different types of bottomless drinks, the buffet as mentioned above, and ofcourse the 6 or 7 different main courses from CBG?s fabulous menu and a choice of desserts (two to choose from, the brownie-alamode w/ Belgian chocolate sauce, and vanilla ice cream, or the best bread pudding on the strip ; )\nPer head cost including a very generous tax and tip?only Rs.1300/person. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST QUALITY ONE CAN FIND FOR THIS PRICE!!! I felt like someone had transported me back to the Musharaf when  Rs. 1300 was a whopping US $22, whereas today it is a meager $14?I had street food for more than this-  Hussain Tariq, u must be a magician ?cause the freshness and high quality for this amount can?t yield profits, but will surly capitulate relationships and gr8 memories : )))))))))))))))))))","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-09T20:02:48+0000","like_count":4,"user_likes":false},{"id":"422621937788962","from":{"name":"Saira Faruqi","id":"521702664"},"message":"Wow, what a fantastic review .... next stop, CBG!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-10T04:57:01+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"422629384454884","from":{"name":"Sirosh Ishaq Usman","id":"718110423"},"message":"yum","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-08-10T05:28:48+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"422666621117827","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Shaikh Fawad Buddy thank you for such a lovely review, have made our team read both the reviews yours and Reshma one as well!!

Pretty decent. The variety for iftar was good, and tasted nice too. Actually, someone like me could have had a complete meal from what was on offer from iftar buffet! :) There were 4 of us, so we ordered 4 different dishes from the main course option. I had rosemary infused beef, and liked it. The seafood teriyaki platter (i think that was it) was ok. Wouldn't recommend it! Thai green curry was also not bad, but nothing for which i'd rush back. Fuschia is much better for that. Desserts need to be worked upon. Overall, it was a nice experience. Another great thing about the place was that there is a gent's prayer area just walking distance from the restuarant. And inspite of space restrictions, there was a small prayer area for females too in the restaurant.

I will be ordering in / dining in very soon.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-08-06T19:52:21+0000","updated_time":"2012-08-07T05:10:05+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"694238742","name":"Shaikh Fawad"},{"id":"606278073","name":"Syed Ali Raza Abidi"},{"id":"840619510","name":"Merchant Abid"},{"id":"777233042","name":"Kamran Hasan"},{"id":"777621756","name":"Masooma Dharamsey"},{"id":"777647802","name":"Farhan Faruqi"},{"id":"715045338","name":"Muhammad Shabbir Yusuf"},{"id":"749703456","name":"Najeeb Rehman"},{"id":"699918830","name":"Hajra Amir"},{"id":"1453901313","name":"Rabiya Syed"},{"id":"507748093","name":"Saira Naqui"},{"id":"543405800","name":"Tahir Wahid"},{"id":"670100198","name":"Najam Quddusi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjcwMTAwMTk4","before":"Njk0MjM4NzQy"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"421409684576854","from":{"name":"Hussain Tariq","id":"1269558660"},"message":"Irfan Ismail Thanks bro..really appreciate your feedback and really happy that you enjoyed your meal!!

The best part about Cbg has always been its serene and comfy environment and today also we just sat there ,talked and enjoyed our time stuffed with good food but as iftaar is incomplete without tea so we had tea afterwards and no one rushed us .Although I missed Hussain Tariq today but his team was as courteous and efficient as always and that's always a cherry on the top if the service is as good as the food!

There was a lot of apprehension surrounding the choice as they are not easily pleased when it comes to trying out a new eatery.

According to them everything was as close to perfection as possible. The soup was delectable, the chicken was juicy and the beef had the right flavour. Thank you CBG for making their special day even more special.

There was nothing Tom Yummy about it as I felt it lacked the clearness and the spiciness of an authentic Tum Yum. The soup's  was quite thick and it was not very spicy. Nonetheless it was very very good and should be tried but Deli should perhaps changing the name of that soup to something else. Main course, ordered Wasabi Beef Sandwich which was pretty decent.

It was kind of houseful as a large group was present. It was very obvious from the service and staff's body language that they were not confident to serve the full house. First my daughter ordered Bruschetta for appetizer and the waiter brought something different. When the right order came obviously rest of us were finished with our appetizers. Our friend ordered a beaf steak and they came back to tell us that all the steaks were consumed by the other group so they were out of stock. Instead we ordered Grilled Snapper. When the main course came, the first bite from the fish tasted funny. I smelled it and Uuuughh it was stinking and very obvious that the meat had gone bad. We called the waiter and returned the dish, for 10 mins there was a corner conference near the kitchen, everyone smelling the dish and making faces. Finally they came and asked if they want us to order another fish? Hello....what about the one you served earlier? They said we have complained to the chef....bla bla bla......\nA restaurant experience is not just about the food although food is usually most important. But the experience starts from the moment you call them for a reservation or give your car to the valet till you leave satisfied and there is a smiling face at the door asking you to come again. Last night Blue Ginger failed miserably on all parameters, food, service, ambience (lamp shade on top of our table was also broken). I would certainly not recommend this place. Weather has changed and with so many power breakdowns food gets spoiled in the refrigerators. I am sure they at Cafe Blue Ginger do not take care of it. Probably meat is defrosted and frozen again....at least I won't go there again ever.","type":"status","created_time":"2012-05-06T05:22:59+0000","updated_time":"2012-05-06T12:52:46+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"373721009345722","from":{"name":"Adnaan Chaudhary","id":"1032941953"},"message":"Fair balanced review.

However the quality of food and service detoriated so bad so soon..held a management dinner there mid Dec, the food tasted below average and the waiters stank. They somehow were adament on removing plates before we could finish our food and were bending over our heads to do so. We complained multiple times but no use. In starters, the calamari was stale and not crunchy as usual, the salads lacked seasoning and were dry, only wontons were the saviours. In main course, the spicy lemon fish was bland, the shrimps were overcooked, the glass noodles tasted really odd with only dominant red chilli flavour, spicy red chicken & sweet & sour chicken were only decent entrees. Creme brulee in dessert was a major disappointment for whoever ordered it. They lost good 10 potential and 4 existing customers that day! i hope they recover soon.. till next good review from anyone its off my list!","type":"status","created_time":"2012-01-10T12:57:55+0000","updated_time":"2012-01-11T07:29:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"677666360","name":"Fazal Gafur"},{"id":"728371533","name":"Ismaa Khan"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NzI4MzcxNTMz","before":"Njc3NjY2MzYw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"293659717351852","from":{"name":"Shafia Agha","id":"650845003"},"message":"bee, you should have gone to Pompei.. :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T13:13:44+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293674054017085","from":{"name":"Benish Omair","id":"512153949"},"message":"Yup sent the team to Pompei next day..but I had high hopes from forty4 :(","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T13:46:42+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293682410682916","from":{"name":"Ismaa Khan","id":"728371533"},"message":"Going to wait for the green light from you, Benish before we head there.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T14:05:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293699430681214","from":{"name":"Reshma Rajpar","id":"100001014475620"},"message":"yes the ambience is veryyy nice they need to work better on their food","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T14:46:53+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"293879597329864","from":{"name":"Syed Ghazanfar Agha","id":"584682243"},"message":"went there last night and the food was good! 7 of us and everyone loved what they got...","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-01-10T20:25:40+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false},{"id":"294198240631333","from":{"name":"Nezihe Hussain","id":"619235873"},"message":"There are still more bad reviews than good ones  and the stinky waiters clinched it for me.

But alas, what the mind wants, sometimes the stomach cannot handle since it is almost 10pm and I have not eaten since lunch!! Mariyam had the chicken, we tried both soups as well as the satay and calamari ... and finished off with bread pudding. If that was not enough, Mariyam got to try the fig ice cream courtesy of Hussain and enjoyed that too. All in all, and not to sound like the CBG groupies that we are, it was the usual great experience for us. We even got presents which was a nice touch ... thank you for those!!

We settled on Xander's since a couple of people have recommended it and it has a courtyard where we could sit outside and the little one could putter around. As it turns out the courtyard was swarming with flies so that was a non-starter and we moved indoors. The decor was nice and the staff courteous and friendly. My daughter loved the Christmas Tree and got a complimentary chocolate which she scarfed down in no time. I was a little disappointed with the menu selection which seemed limited and at first I couldn't really find anything that took my fancy, however when a couple of plates of fish and chips wafted by for the neighbouring table, both my wife and I were tempted since it looked like genuine battered english-style fish and chips.\n\nThe service was swift, but as it turns out the fish was very poor. It just tasted off somehow (my wife claimed one of the pieces she got tasted fine so it may have been the fish was a bit old - I'm not sure) and the tartar sauce was also strangely sour - I'm not sure if that was because of something in it or it was also getting on in age. The quantity of the fish was nothing to write home about but since neither of us liked it that wasn't an issue. The fries were standard mon salwa type stuff and in good quantities. We regretted not getting different dishes, though as I said earlier I wasn't too impressed by the diversity of the selection. We unanimously decided to forgo desert at Xander's and go elsewhere instead (ended up going to Hotspot where the desert was great as usual but the experience slightly spoilt by a table-full of 14 year-old girls smoking like chimneys).\n\nBut as it turns out our troubles at Xander's weren't over. I paid by credit card but was told by the cashier that they were getting an error and it wasn't charged. So I paid in cash but then checked my phone to see I had received an sms from the credit card company saying it had been charged. I showed the msg to the staff who said I should ignore it since it hadnt been charged. I called the card people who confirmed it had been and informed the staff. To cut a long story short it took over 20 minutes to sort the matter out by which time the kids were going stir-crazy and I had a splitting headache. The problem probably wasn't the staff's fault and they were courteous throughout but it made the whole experience all the more disappointing. When my wife asked me later if I'd ever want to go again I thought I wouldn't completely rule out the idea but probably not for a full meal.","type":"status","created_time":"2011-12-25T11:26:15+0000","updated_time":"2011-12-26T06:46:35+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1359810443","name":"Nuria Munir"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTM1OTgxMDQ0Mw\u003d\u003d","before":"MTM1OTgxMDQ0Mw\u003d\u003d"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"283942944990196","from":{"name":"Nida Huq","id":"850419690"},"message":"I agreed with you.
